Everybody, come on and dance, let's party tonight
I'm bringing this funk to set a good mood for you
So raise up, don't sit on your can
You gotta bring it funky to fulfill my plan
You thought I was only bringing you techno house and pop
Those are not the only beats that'll make you rock
Now I like country, R &B and jazz
I even like my hip-hop, but the funk right now it's where it's at
Say come on and dance, let's party tonight
I'm bringing this funk to set a good mood for you
So raise up, don't you sit on your can
You gotta bring it funky to fulfill my plan
Now this groove is cookin' like earth, wind, and fire
G e Clinton and the parliament
Don't et about Sly and the family stones
I know they were funky, but this is my own
Everybody come on and dance, let's party tonight
I'm bringing this funk to set a good mood for you
So raise up, don't you sit on your can
You gotta bring it funky to fulfill my plan
Jalisco's fun, Jalisco's fun
That's what it is
Jalisco's fun, Jalisco's fun
Whoa, whoa
Jalisco's fun, Jalisco's fun
Hey, that's what it is
Jalisco's fun, Jalisco's fun
Party tonight
Can you feel my funk?
It'll get more funkier
Everybody
You gotta bring it funky
Can you feel my funk?
Can you feel my thumb? (Can you feel)
Can you feel (love your lips) my thumb?
Just let it set in your shoes (just let it set in your shoes for a minute)
It'll get more funky and I think we just keep staring it up (keep staring it up)
We gotta keep pushing this groove (pushing this groove to the max, yeah)
Can you feel love your lips so fine? (keep staring it up, keep staring it up)
Just let it set in your shoes
Can you feel my funk, yeah?
It'll get more funkier if we just keep stirring it up
Keep stirring it up, keep stirring it up
Push this groove to the max, yeah
Young bitch, self-funk
That's what it is, young bitch, self-funk
That's what it is, young bitch, self-funk
My funk
My funk (don't let yourself funk) more funkier (don't let yourself funk)
In my shoes, my shoes, my shoes, my shoes
In your shoes, your shoes, in your shoes, in your shoes
It'll get much funkier, it's getting funkier
Keep pushing this groove and you'll feel my funk
