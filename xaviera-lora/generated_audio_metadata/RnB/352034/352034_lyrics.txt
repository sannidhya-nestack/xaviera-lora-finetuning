Being here, I always said there's nothing I miss more than the ocean, the sea
But now I know baby, one thing I miss far more
Being together, you and me
Feel me
Now listen
Just know one
There's just no one girl
Else for me
No one else in this world
Can delight your eyes
You and me
Are what we're meant to be
I hold you close
Hold you so close baby
The lights are low
Just candlelight
We're in love
We're so in love baby
All I need to know
That's all I ever need to know
I just don't know how long we can hold on
We both know our love is strong
But life just ain't that long
We got it going on
When we make love
When we make love baby
Our feelings flow
Never had a feeling like that
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Soul to soul
Soul to soul
Listen to me, baby, I'm crazy over you
You see what you're doing to me
It just ain't no other, every song
I sing for you
You're my world
We'll do whatever we have to do
To make this dream come true
Baby, we both know what we got to do
Gonna have to break some hearts to make this work
I'm crazy
Just going crazy with you
Got to be with you
Got to have you in my life
I'm crazy
I'm just crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy for you, come on, girl, girl, girl
