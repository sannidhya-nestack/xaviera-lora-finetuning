I don't even know where to begin
Sometimes we be thinking the same thing
We finish each other's sentences like the same brain
Without your heart girl I'll probably go insane
You and I both know how it is
Yeah this love it started when we was kids
Cause you and I we shine we shine
Ain't no other love be better than yours and mine
Let'em talk and walk it over there
to me, something seems so crystal clear
Like how we move to our own tune
We never gotta share what's going on over here
There is no other like you
Who makes me feel what I do
When it comes to the way I feel about you
There is no other like me
Who makes your heart basically
Feel and cherish every little thing about you, yeah
Ooh, tell me what you think about me
Ooh, yeah
Time and time I tell myself we should be together
Loving one another sharing deep emotions uncovered
I look back on younger days when the time just slipped away
Too young to know that this love we have will grow
In my life I never knew
A love so true like the one we share
For you I'll always care
There is no other like you
Who makes me feel what I do
When it comes to the way I feel about you
There is no other like me
Who makes your heart basically
Feel I'll cherish every little thing about you, yeah
Girl, tell me what you think about me
For the God, baby you make time
Other people they fly and pass by
But you stay, get comfy and snuggle under me
You know I stay appreciating your style
Baby, take me by the hand
Love me'til the end, the end of time
Promise me you'll forever be mine
I never knew a love so true
Like the one we share
For you, I'll always care
There is no other like you
Who makes me feel what I do
When it comes to the way I feel about you
There is no other like me
Who makes your heart basically
Feel I'll cherish every little thing about you
Tell me what you think about me
Come on, now come on
There is no other like you
Tell me what you think about me
I'll cherish every little thing
There is no other like you
Tell me what you think about
I'll cherish every little thing about you
