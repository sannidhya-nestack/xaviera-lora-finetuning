Raise your hand, all will be fine
Keep your faith, you're not the only one
Who feels this way?
And tomorrow is another day
Don't look down, don't lose sight of all those
Surrounding you of what you own
For we've been blessed my friend
You are not alone
Look around you and realize you've always had
Everything you need and everything you want, look around you
Open your eyes and realize
That everything you need and everything you want is right here where we are
Feel your strength ground your feet
Lose the burden that once held you down
Don't look back, you'll gain hope again
Just give it time
Look around you and realize you've always had everything you need and everything you want
Look around you, just open your eyes and realize
That everything you need and everything you want is right here where, where we are
Every road has its destination
Every choice we make affects our lives
Every time we cry someone else cries
Every time we smile someone smiles
Raise your hand, all will be fine
Keep your faith, you're not the only one
Who feels this way
And tomorrow is another day
