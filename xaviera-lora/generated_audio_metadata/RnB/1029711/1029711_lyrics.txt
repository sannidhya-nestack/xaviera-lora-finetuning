There's a cloud overhead
That just follows me around
I can't seem to shake it
Even on the other side of town
No money in my pocket
No gas in the car
No broom in the closet
So we kick it
All around
And I know you don't know the reason
And I know you don't know the plan
It's a long time coming
Doing the best I can
So wait for me, wait
For me, just hold on a little, little bit longer
You've got to wait, please wait
Just hold on a little, little bit longer
Crying eyes, wearing big disguise, sitting on the bench
Dreaming of a big old house with a picket fence
Strolling down the avenue, couldn't find a cab
Hanging out at the Pit Stop bar, increasing my tab
And I know you don't know the reason
And I know you don't know the plan
It's a long time coming
Doing the best I can
So wait for me
Please wait for me
Just hold on a little
A little bit longer
You've got to wait, please wait
Just hold on a little, little bit longer
You got to wait, please wait
You got to hold on a little, a little bit longer
Oh wait, please wait
And just hold on
You've got to hold on, just hold on, a little bit longer
