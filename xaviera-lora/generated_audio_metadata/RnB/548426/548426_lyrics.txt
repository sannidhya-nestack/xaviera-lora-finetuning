I am a superstar, always starting something new to never finish anything
I always fly on my ideas that never get me anywhere
I tend to drive on inspiration
Throw away the map, don't need no navigation
But starting never got me far
all I ever get is love
'Cause if I start something with you
I'll make sure that it will stick
And baby, I promise that you'll be the first flame that will last
I am a superstar, yeah
I'm known from the start
I'll never see the finish line
I'm over zoomed to fill
And all I do is waste my time
Please, baby, come and help me
Stop the new beginning
Start a happy ending
So one day I can say
I lived happily ever after with you
'Cause if I start something with you
I'll make sure that it will stick
And baby I, I promise that you
Will be the first thing that will last
Boy, you're dirty and sad to go
I'll set aside a brand new life so baby come home
I would surrender'til I ran out of breath
Oh,'cause if I start something with you
I'll make sure that it will stick
Oh, baby, I, I promise that you
Will be different, same, oh
Because if I start something with you
I'll make sure that it will stick
Oh baby I promise you
You'll be the first thing that will last
