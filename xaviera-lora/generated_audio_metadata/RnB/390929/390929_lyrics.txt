Oh man, I mean I don't even know what's going on for a minute
I mean, man they always trying to stop us man
Then when we rolling I mean, then they got all these snitches coming up man
I mean where do they get these people from man?
We gonna holla at you for a minute
What's up? Let me holla at you
Run your mouth, I'll make your throat back a see-through
All it takes is a slug, get your grave dug
Should've shut up, don't tell me what I'm capable of
If I can't get you in corners, leave you on a limb
Lonely now you a goner, for talking to him
They got you on tape too, what you gon' do?
Lay down like a man, a snitch on your crew
He take the wire on his chest to catch us up
Shoulda known I'ma pat him for a holla at him
Distribution of narcotics better learn about it
I can tell my boy to kill you that's what he'll do
Claim he needed an 8 feet to start him out
Plus he's willing to pay double in his drought
I grab his wrist to check his pulse it was steady
He's lucky cause I cut him up like I was Freddy
What's up with this stuff I thought you needed cakes
And now we here instead of 36 you calling 8's
Serve this fool get him out make sure he closes mouth
And let him know if he squealed I cut his tongue out
Pour some acid on his neck
Give me respect, blow your liver out your back
You be like what the heck, so if you tellin' get the bell in
Cause I know this game, break you down like a Benjamin in a chump change
A snitch (yup) he's a (I know he's a) snitch (I know he's a) a snitch (yup) he's a (yup) he's a snitch (I know he's a) a snitch (yup) he's a (I know he's a) snitch (I know he is a) a snitch (yup) he is a snitch (he is a) I know he is a (yup) he is a snitch (I know he is a) he is a snitch (I know he's a) he is a snitch (yup) he is a snitch (I know he is a) he is A snitch (yup) he is A snitch (I know he's a) he is A snitch (yup) he is A snitch (I know he's a) he is A snitch
Oh man, I bet you they finna pull me over
Yep, there it go, there it go, the blue lights, the blue lights
I mean, I smell since the week
Man, I mean, I ain't even did nothin'
Step out of the car, sir
I mean, out of the car
Ain't you gon' ask me for my license or somethin'? Don't be gettin' no attitude
Damn, don't want that man, I mean what did I do, what did I do?
You know what you did, behind the back
Don't be getting intimate on me, you ain't gotta be going through all that, I mean
I'm trying to show you my license man would you just uh, man you
Right by the hook station every day check out the court appearances in the d8
Kinda figured he was shaky didn't like his style
He got busted yesterday today he's all smiles
Protect your child making wobble talking like Tekapo
This ain't nightline say a soldier do your time
I can smell a snitch from all the way he's bottoms up
So it's top to his bottom lip and I try to sip
Keep the team clean, smelling fresh like Listerine
What does it really mean, you sell me out for fifteen?
Push his hair back, get him a sack and cut his throat
This issue is as funny to me as Bob Hope
Take the tires off his car, set him on bricks
And staple two ounces of crack to his wrist
Leave a nose address, send it to the FBI
How many more we gotta kill to prove it's real?
Yeah you wanna rob me
And take my keys
Why can't you come like a real man and get with me
Every time you see a snitch he's going to a ditch
And when you pull up in rage you see I mean it, uh
A snitch, I know he's a snitch, a snitch, he's a snitch, a snitch, I know he's a snitch
A snitch, I know he's a snitch, a snitch, he's a snitch
A snitch, I know he's a snITCH, a snitch, he's a snITCH
