A new world is coming, where soldiers in the army of love
Fighting for the souls of everyone
Equality and justice is our song (our song)
And we don't seek out, we don't harvest the genius of the least of out
We don't pay'em any attention, we just walk by'em
Give'em a quarter and think it's alright
But the idea of anizing the least of ours and moving upwards
I mean if you go look at the civil rights bill we passed it on behalf of black folks
Baby I do
Love you for a lifetime
We know our love is true
Till the end of time
Oh, how we build a new world filled with love and care
Babylon is burning, let's prepare
Freedom for all, this is our prayer
Chana
It's no reason because we have a PhD, a master's, a BA, a BS from a university
That we have more genius than anybody else
We have to approach each human being with the dignity and the expectation that
We can discover genius we never even dreamed of
Baby I do (ha, ha) I love you for a lifetime
We know our love is true (oh yeah)
Till the end of time (till the end of time)
Baby I do (do do do do do)
Love you for a lifetime
We know our love is true (love me forever)
Till the end of time
'Til the end of time (baby I do)
Baby I (love you for a lifetime)
I do, I do, I do (we know our love is true)
Oh yeah (til the end of time)
the end of time (darling I do)
Love you for all I've done (I love you more and more)
We know our love is true (stay with me forever)
Till the end of time (ooh, oh)
Till the end of time (I want you)
Till the end of time (I love you)
Till the end of time (forever)
Till the end of time (I love you baby)
'Til the end of time
They can't see through the haze, the clouds
Like the idea of building a movement from the bottom up
Don't ring a bell in their head
They still believe the intelligentsia has the genius to get people justice
But it's the ones in pain that know where they hurt
and know what is needed for them to not have pain again.
