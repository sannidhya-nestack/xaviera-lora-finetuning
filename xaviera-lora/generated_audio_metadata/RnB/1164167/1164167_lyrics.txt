This time I'm ready for whatever happens
Keeping my distance to save my heart
You might be thinking I'm being dramatic
I should have done this right from the start
I thought you would be different but I got caught
On every lie you sold me
The big illusion of your love
That never was
It's not so easy to be in your presence
You want the spotlight to shine on you (you)
We are acting like you're independent
It won't be long before I am too
I thought you would be different but I got
On every lie you sold me
The big illusion of your love that never was
I thought you would be different but I got caught on every lie
You sold me the big illusion of your love that never was
I thought you would be different but I got caught on every lie
You sold me the big illusion of your love that never was
I thought you would be different but I got caught in every lie you sold me
That big illusion of your love that never never never was
