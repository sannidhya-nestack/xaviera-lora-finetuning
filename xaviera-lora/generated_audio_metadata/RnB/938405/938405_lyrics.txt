Running and swimming and laughing and flying
It's where I want to be
Flowing in the ocean of my mind
Running, swimming
It's where I want to be with you
Running and swimming and laughing and flying it's where I want to be
Flowing in the ocean of my mind
Laughing and flying
It's where I want to be with you
Running, swimming, it's where I want to be
Laughing and flying, it's where I want to be with you
Running, swimming
(Ooooooh)
Flowing in the ocean of my mind
Running and swimming and laughing and flying it's where I want to be
Flowing in the ocean of my mind
Running, sweeping
Running, sweeping
It's where I want to be with you
