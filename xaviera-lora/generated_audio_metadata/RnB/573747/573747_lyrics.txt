I never knew about a lonely night
A missing kiss is under a candlelight
Until you came into my life
Take my love
Don't let it go
For there's something you should know
It's true
I love you
I'm feeling fresh, I'm like a brand new girl
My thoughts are racing and my heart's in a whirl
Since you came into my world
Take my love, don't let it go
there's one thing you should know
It's true, I love you
'Cause life is for living (Mama always used to say)
And love is for giving away
Take my love, don't let it go
I want the world to know
It's true, I love you
Take my love, don't let it go
I want you to know
It's true, I love you
It's true, I love you
