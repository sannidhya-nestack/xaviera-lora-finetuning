Help me out with the situation, help me out with the situation
A and B, A and B, help me out with the situation
Get my hustle on
I ain't got a dime in my hand
I got some property
I just put up for sale
The situation ain't right for me
And I say oh well, oh well
Look on the bright side
At least you got your health
It ain't always about wealth
The fathers always take care of me
But until then
I don't have a dime until next pay
Gotta go to the store
Juice four dollars a gallon next pay
Gotta go to the store
Juice five dollars a gallon next pay
This light bill just took all I had
My rent's due, my electric's due, my gas
Mailman just brought me a medical bill
Mailman just brought me a credit card bill
Gas prices high and I don't understand why so
I don't have a dime to pay (I don't have a dime to pay)
I'm getting my hustle on, this song's for folks that's grown
Working up a sweat (working up a sweat)
Working off this debt (working off this debt)
Got me on the run because of my lack of funds
I don't have a dime to pay (I don't have a dime to pay)
I'm getting my hustle on (I'm getting my hustle on)
Some folks that's grown
Working up a sweat, working off this debt
All up in the hood, wishing things was good
But I don't have that, I don't have a dime, till next payday
I got bad news today
My boy just got laid off
Now that is a crying shame
Twenty years on the job
But we done been through tougher things than this
We done suffered for years and still we exist
Tell my boy to come over to my barbecue
Cheer up nothing ever lasts
This too shall pass
Gotta go to the store
Juice four dollars a gallon x pay
Gotta go to the store
Juice five dollars a gallon x pay
This light bill just took all I had
My rent's due, my electric's due, my gas
Mailman just brought me a medical pill
Mailman just brought me a credit card deal
Gas prices high and I don't understand why so
I don't have a dime to pay (I don't have a dime yeah)
I'm getting my hustle on (I'm getting my hustle on)
This song's for folks that's grown
Working up a sweat (working up a sweat)
Working up this dad (yeah)
Got me on the run (got me on the run)
Because of my lack of funds
I don't have a dime to pay (I-I don't have a dime yeah)
I'm getting my hustle on
This song's for folks that's grown
Air and B (Air and B)
Help me out with the situation
All up in the hood (All up in the hood)
Wishin' things was good but
I don't have a dime (I don't have a dime)
I don't have a dime (I don't have a dime)
Air and B (Air and B)
Help me out with the situation
Everything's gonna be alright
But until then I gotta go to store
Until then
Gotta go to the store
Until then
This light bill just took all I had (light bill just took all I had)
My gas
The medical bill (medical bill)
A credit card bill
Gas prices high
And I don't understand why so
I don't have a dime in bed
I'm getting my hustle on
This song's for folks that's grown
Working up a sweat
Working up a sweat
Got me on the run
Because of my lack of fun
I don't have a dime until next payday
I've been getting my hustle alone
This song's for folks that's grown
Working up a sweat
Working off this debt
All up in the hood
Wishing things was good but
I don't have a dime until next payday
