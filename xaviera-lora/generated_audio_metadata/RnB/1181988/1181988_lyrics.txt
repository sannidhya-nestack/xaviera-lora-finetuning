All I wanted was you to talk to me
And take a listen to what my heart needs
Baby, baby, make me believe you still care
Why won't you open up and let me in
I miss the way we were back when
Tell me was it something I did that brought us here
You can leave me in the dark
Just tell me where we are
I'm begging you from down on my knees
Am I missing the signs
Or am I fool to go and mind
Baby talk to me
You used to show me how much I was adored
Your eyes would tell me I'd forever be yours
Now I'm just not so sure anymore
You've grown cold, so cold
You can leave in the dark
Just tell me where we are
I'm begging you from down on my knees
Am I missing the signs?
Or am I fooled to call you mine?
Baby talk to me
Tell me your secrets
Don't care if it hurts
not knowing how you feel
Oh, it cuts even worse
You can leave me in the dark
Just tell me where we are
I'm begging you from down on my knees
Am I missing the signs
Or am I put a coin in mine
Baby talk to me
Oh, oh, oh, baby talk, baby talk, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
