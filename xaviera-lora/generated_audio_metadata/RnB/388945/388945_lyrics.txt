There I go, looking for a rainbow
There I go, reaching for the stars
And I keep hoping for your love, dear
For tomorrow will be a bright new day
I've been told dreaming is a fool's way
I've been told dreaming's just for kids
But whenever stormy clouds appear now
I let my hopes and dreams blow them away
That golden promise may seem so far away
Beyond the rainbow
But I know I'll reach it one day
Because I know loving brings a rainbow and stars shining in your eyes
So I'll keep hoping that you'll need me
Yes, tomorrow will be a bright new day
That golden promise may seem so far away beyond the rainbow
But I know I'll reach it one day
There I go, looking for a rainbow
There I go, reaching for the stars
And I keep hoping for your love, dear
For tomorrow will be a bright new day
