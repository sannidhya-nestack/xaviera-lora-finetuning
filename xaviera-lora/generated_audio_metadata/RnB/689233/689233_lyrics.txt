Oh, oh, oh
These bills ain't paying themselves, no, no
And I swear I wish they were
You got me foolin' myself now
Tellin' me, "Girl, you're doin' good"
See, you got me drinkin', I'm thinkin'bout leavin'
And you got me runnin', heavy, I'm breathin' out
Because it's heavy now, heavy now
I keep running round, running round
Cause it's heavy now, heavy now
But I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
Running round, running round
'Cause it's heavy now, heavy now
And I'm running round, running round
But I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
these bills ain't paying themselves, no
they keep on coming in my door
You want me to pay you and pay you and pay you and you too
And I'm through, tell me why
It's hard to laugh for me, yeah
You got me drinking, I'm thinking'bout leaving, running
Tired, I'm breathing heavy, heavy, yeah
You got me drinking, I'm thinking'bout leaving, running
And I'm tired, I'm breathing heavy, heavy, yeah
You know it's heavy now, heavy now
I keep running round, running round
it's heavy now, heavy now
And I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
Running round, running round (You've got me drinking, I'm thinking about leaving you)
it's heavy now, heavy now (I'm tired, I'm breathing heavy, yeah)
Running round, but I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
Heavy now, heavy now, but I'm running round, running round
Cause it's heavy now, heavy now, and I can't, can't keep on, can' can't keep on
Running round
Running round, cause it's heavy now, heavy now
And I'm running round, running round
But I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
Running round, running round
Cause it's heavy now, heavy now
And I'm running round, running round
But I can't, can't keep on, can't, can't keep on
