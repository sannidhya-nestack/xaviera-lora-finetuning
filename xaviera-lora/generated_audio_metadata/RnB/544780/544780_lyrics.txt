Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I said I'd always be with you
I said I'd always be faithful
When it looked my way I knew I
Wasn't gonna do the right thing
You know I love you baby
You know I'll always be your lady
But now I'm holding in this secret
I don't know how to tell you baby
In the heat
I lost my mind, I didn't know what to do
He was there in the darkness, he knew all the right words
When he reached out to me, I just had to see what he was made of
But I don't love him
And he doesn't treat me like you do
It was a one night stand, you're still my man
Baby please ive me'cause I don't love him
And he isn't half the man you are
I was a fool to fall and risk it all
Honey please don't leave me'cause I don't love him
I don't wanna put you through this
I don't know how I could do this
Now you're hurting and I'm sorry
I've done wrong and I know this
I don't have any feelings for him
I don't wanna lose your love, boy
But now I've lost your trust, please tell me
We can try and work this out'cause
This is so
Oh, hard to tell you
Baby, I just can't hide
It's here inside
I'm feeling so ashamed
You've been with me for so long
Let me right what is so wrong
Let me have the chance to prove that
You're the only one I want, baby
I don't love you
And he doesn't treat me like you do
It was a one night stand, you're still my man
Baby please ive me'cause I don't love him
And he isn't half the man you are
I was a fool to fall and risk it all
Honey please don't leave me'cause I don't love him
Why do you want to know this?
No it wasn't here in our home
What else you want to know?
I work with a guy and baby I'm not gonna lie
I saw him in a bar and it started at his car
No it wasn't overnight cause he sorta has a wife
Yeah I knew it was wrong and I knew it all along
Baby please stop questioning me
All you gotta know is I don't love him
And he doesn't treat me like you do
It was a one night stand, you're still my man
Baby please ive me'cause I don't love him
And he isn't half the man you are
I was a fool to fall and risk it all
Honey please don't leave me'cause I don't love him
I don't love you
You're the only one I want, baby
I don't love you
