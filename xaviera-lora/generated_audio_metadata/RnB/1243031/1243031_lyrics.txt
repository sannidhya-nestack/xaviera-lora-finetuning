Sun shining on my face and I love it
Wind blowing through my hair and I love it
Skin of honey, lips of dory
I know you love it
It's so sincere
Ooh, you got me skating under palm trees
Promise that you'll call me
Call me, don't text
Don't text me into oblivion
Value being serious
Roll the bounds
Roll it, roll it, roll it
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
Mou moi
Shuffle right next to me
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
Moonwalk
Second verse, wood, ah, ah, ah, ah
Underneath the skates
And I love it
Crows, I see you (I see you)
Stylin' with the moves
And I love it
Couple strolling, dough, no dipping
I know you're feeling it
It's so sincere
Ooh you got me skating on the palm tree
Promise that you'll call me
Call me, don't text
Don't text me into oblivion
Value being serious
Roll bound
Roll it roll it roll it
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
Mou moi
Shuffle right next to me
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
You can roll bounce (bounce)
Moonwalk away (walk away)
Shuffle in place (place)
Stuntin' on your crazy legs (crazy legs)
Whatever you choose (choose)
I don't make the rules (rules)
It's all up to you
Ooh, you got me skatin' on the palm tree
Promise that you'll call me (it's so sincere)
I know you love it
Don't text me into oblivion
Value being serious
Roll the bounds
Roll it roll it roll it
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
Moonwalk
Eh eh eh eh
Now shuffle to the crazy legs
Show me that you ain't afraid
Moonwalk
