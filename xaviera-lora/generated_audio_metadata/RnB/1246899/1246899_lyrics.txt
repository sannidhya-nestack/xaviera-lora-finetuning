We broke up on the backyard
That was so sick, oh baby, damn hard
I needed you to understand
That something I can't take
Something that I can't escape, can't escape
Oh, leave me alone
I need nothing at all
Just don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
We broke up on the backyard
That was so sick of baby damn hard
I needed you to understand
That something I can't change
Something that I can't escape, can't escape
Oh, leave me alone
I need nothing at all
Just don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
