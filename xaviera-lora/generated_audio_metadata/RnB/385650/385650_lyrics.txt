This is a song about getting stoned, just do the stuff that's self good
Just be angry, don't be mad, just be happy, just be glad
Don't be crazy, don't be coy, it's loose now, brand new joy
Well I feel so good boy, I must be high
Well I feel so special
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
Too big nerds don't be shy
Sweet Jack get on by
Keep me speedy don't be quick
Snoozin' on half-sale
When I feel so good boy
I must be high yeah
When I feel so special
Ain't it good to be alive yeah
When you're high yeah
Ain't it good to be alive yeah
When you're high yeah
Well I feel so good
One more speed high
Well it feels so special
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
When you're high, yeah
And I'm with you, I'm alive, I'm with you, I'm
Ain't it good to be alive, yeah
Ain't it good to be alive, ain't it good, ain't it, ain't it, ain't it good to be alive
