Connected to the stars
You can wish upon whatever you want
You know
I'm about it
Ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it
Ooh, I'm about it
Out of love I've been there for ya
Getting choked up in your arms
That's when you know it's real
Can we work this out'cause I'm so deep in love
Don't let this go to the background
You probably noticed I'm about it
I'm the one that'll be there when no one wants to take you on
Love for the battles and drama, yeah
Doesn't matter near or far
You're a star, you're a star
Maybe in the past I was wrong
maybe in the past I was young, young
But I'm so sure of this now
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
So about this love
So about this trust
In my zone, in my zone
Everything's working
So about this feeling
So about love
I'm going hard, going in
Not running out of time
Baby, I'm finesse, whatever's good
You probably noticed I'm about it
I'm the one that'll be there when no one wants to take you on (cause you take me on)
Not a charity case, no you're not
I see you as what you are
You're a star, you're a star
Baby in the past I was wrong
baby in the past I was young, young
But I'm so sure of this now
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it, yeah
Connected to the stars
You can wish upon whatever you want, you know
I'm about it, ooh, I'm about it
I'm about it, oh I'm about it
