I would be with you now if I could
I would hold you somehow if I could
I would love you tonight and make you feel alright
If I could do all those things I would
I would give you a new start if I could
I would fix your broken heart if I could
I would take away your sorrow
And give you a new tomorrow
If I could do all those things I would
If I could (If I could) I would (I would)
Remove the pain from your face
And put a smile in its place
If I could (If I could)
If I could (If I could)
If I could do all those things I would
I would give you happiness if I could
I would fill your emptiness if I could
I would take your hurt away
And give you a brighter day
If I could do all those things I would
I would head in your direction if I could
To give you all of my affection if I could
I love you and there's nothing I wouldn't do
If I could do all those things I would
If I could (If I could) I would (I would)
Make you see you are the best
And that you stand out from the rest
If I could (If I could) If I could (If I could)
I would do all those things (If I could do all those things)
If I could do all those things I would
If I could, I would
Keeping you close to my heart
And make sure we never part
If I could, if I could
If I could do all those things I would
If I could do all those things
If I could do all those things I would
