Your love, your love, it's just like that
Your love, your love, it's just like that
Your love is just like that
Your love, your love
Yeah it's just like sun and the rain
Together helps things come alive
Like pleasure and pain
Brings new life and divine design
It's like a song
I've heard it before but it's new
Finally I've found
The sound of my heartbeat, it's you
And your love
You're alone, you're alone, yeah, it's just like that
You're alone, you're alone, it's just like that
You're alone, you're alone, yeah, it's just, just like that
Mmm, it just goes like that
It's such a thrill
Over and over again
Gives me chills
It's never too, never too much
And you're alone
Your love is just like that
Your love, your love is just like that
Your love, your love is just like that
Your love, your love is just, just like that
