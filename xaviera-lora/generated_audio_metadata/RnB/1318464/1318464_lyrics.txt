Yeah, we're shaking it up and we're bringing it down
Where everybody is welcome and we groove to the sound
The party is popping, it goes all around
We live in the moment
We live in the now
It's a world where people are beautiful
Music is wonderful
Summertime is here it's a festival
Let's celebrate hot girls, cool boys
Sweet love, pure joy
Make peace not war
Let's celebrate the sun kissed beautiful
We hold on to laughter while we move through the night
Everybody is glowing in the warmth of the light
We vibe with the music and our hearts beat in time
We savor each second
Under sun kissed skies so fine
It's a world where people are beautiful
Music is wonderful
Summertime is here it's a festival
Let's celebrate hot girls
Cool boys sweet love pure joy
Make peace not war
Let's celebrate the sun kissed beautiful
The whole world is getting smaller, we must all come together
Join hands we can be stronger, we are better together
And so
We trace silent echoes
Of a day drifting low
But embers still flicker
In a secret afterglow
An electric hush settles
Between pulse and desire
Let's put the pedal to the metal
We're in a sunkissed night confiner
The whole world is getting smaller
We must all come together
Join hands we can be stronger
We are better together
It's a world where
People are beautiful
Music is wonderful
Summertime is here, it's a festival
Let's celebrate
Hot girls, cool boys
Sweet love, pure joy
Make peace, not war
Let's celebrate the sun kissed beautiful
Let's celebrate the sun kissed beautiful
Let's celebrate, the sun kissed beautiful
Let's celebrate, celebrate, sun kissed beautiful
Let's celebrate, the sun kissed beautiful
Let's celebrate, the sun gets beautiful
