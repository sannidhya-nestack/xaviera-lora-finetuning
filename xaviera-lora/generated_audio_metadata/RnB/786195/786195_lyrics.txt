Every time I step up in the club, it's always something that remains same, till I see your face
No matter how I listen
The beat is just a beat without you baby
You make my chest pound like a beat
Girl you make me move
You're my head not a baby
You're my head not a baby
You got me clapping to the beat
Hey girl you're my groove
You're my head not a baby
You're my headliner, baby
And all of a sudden I feel like joy when you step in the room
The way I feel about you, baby, more than music
And all of a sudden I lose myself when you step in the room
The way I feel about you, baby, more than music
I hear them all say
At the club it's not a place to find love
But I gotta prove them wrong
every move you make can be fallin' in love, oh, the love, baby
You make my chest feel like a peak, girl, you make me move
You're my headliner, baby
You're my head nodder baby
You got me clapping to the beat
Hey girl you're my groove
You're my head nodder baby
You're my head nodder baby
And all of a sudden I feel like you
When you step in the room
The way I feel about you baby
More than music
And all of a sudden I lose myself
When you step in the room
The way I feel about you
About you baby
More than music
Want you girl
More than music
Need you girl
More than music
I'm so sure
More than music
Yeah yeah yeah
More than music
Want you girl
More than music
Need you girl
More than music
I'm so sure
(More than music, more than music)
And all of a sudden I feel like you're always stepping in the room
(The way I feel about you baby, more than music)
And all of a sudden I lose myself when you step in the room
(The way I feel about you baby, more than music)
And all of a sudden I feel like joy when you step in the room
The way I feel about you baby, more than music
And all of a sudden I lose myself when you step in the room
The way I feel about you baby, more than music
More than music, more than music
