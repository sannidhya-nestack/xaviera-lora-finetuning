Watch your thoughts, you're so damn wrong
Yeah, I'm feeling like a stranger
Chasing my mind
No, I can't stop this danger
If I won't
Got me wrapped around your finger
You make me work hard
Though I should stop believing
I won't
I don't want your love
You're so damn mean to me
I don't want your love
So damn mean
No I can't get my words out
I know that it's possible for me to make a change
But I can't help my feelings
I'm caught up
Yeah at times I do adore you
Like an addiction you make me relapse
I tell myself I'll stop this
But I won't
I don't want your love
you're so damn mean to me
I don't want your love
So damn mean
I don't want your love
you're so damn mean to me
I don't want your love so damn little
I don't know if I can break free from this broken dream
I don't know if I can break free from this broken dream
I don't know if I can break free from it
If I can't break free from it
I don't want your love, it's so damn mean to me
I don't want your love, it's so damn mean
I don't want your love, you're so damn mean to me
I don't want your love, you're so damn mean
I don't want your love, you're so damned mean
