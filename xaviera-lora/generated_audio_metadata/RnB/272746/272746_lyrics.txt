Tonight's the night
I'll hold you tight
We'll make a wish
Our fears will vanish
If you just take my hand
We'll chase each rainbow
We'll have eternity
To find our destiny
Look at the stars
Please tell me what you see
Heavenly ecstasy waiting for you and me
For now I only see
I need you close to me
Darling I wanna be
Your only history
Uh is this the part where I'm supposed to be funny?
Uh just let the man play his solo
And in a hundred years we'll make our past appear
If we just follow through this is my promise to you
So take this wedding ring, you are my everything
So, so take this wedding ring
You are my everything
So kiss me, hold me tight
Darling, tonight's the night
Oh, tonight
Darling, tonight's the night
Pull down that shade, baby
Tonight, come on over here, oh yeah
