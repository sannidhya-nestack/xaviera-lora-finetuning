But you're still like the sun in the morning
Are you with me? (yeah)
I'm like a horizon
I am now a specific kind of me
Oh no, but I dive
Oh, I'm so confused, feel me sleep, hey
I'm like the sun in the morning
I trust the birds to lead your head
You'll be feeling here as a queen tonight
In your eyes everything's alright
All the worries are just laid away
In your embrace, in your embrace
I wanna stay, step to me like a tree
Nobody to see, nothing that you believe in me
So happy for feeling content, down down for the sunshine
Hey, I don't really pay close attention
Be my ticket to the MC, to a nice friendly lady
Got me feeling like a queen tonight, yeah
In your eyes everything's alright
All the words just fade away
In your embrace
All my brains
I wanna stay
Stand over the pain
And look up to the days
That we are free to be money
Then we are pissed
Have my strength is
That I don't want to let go
Can't be feeling like a queen tonight
In your eyes everything's alright
I'm sorry all the worries just fade away
In your embrace
Embrace, I wanna say
