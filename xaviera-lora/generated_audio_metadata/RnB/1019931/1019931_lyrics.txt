I'm up in the midnight
Just like the night before
Man you stay on my mind like oh oh oh oh
We only talk when you want to
Always on your terms
But when I need someone to run to
No no no no no
And I overthink too much
But I'm running out of luck
Time to change it up
We need less control
Now I feel like a third wheel
To you and all of your feels
Rolling head over heels
Meaning clutch, clench, oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Clutch, clench, oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Clutch, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Oh, clutch control
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, uh, oh
Give me that, give me that, give me that, clutch
Learning the same lessons
Which way should I go?
Need a little direction, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm here for a good night
But I won't be the fool
Gotta get over myself to get over you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, we need clutch control
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Clutch
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, clutch control
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I overthink too much
But I'm running out of luck
Time to change it up
I feel like a third wheel
To you and all your feels
Rolling head over heels
Baby we need the
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
We need clutch control
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Clutch
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Clutch control
Give me that, give me that, give me that touch
