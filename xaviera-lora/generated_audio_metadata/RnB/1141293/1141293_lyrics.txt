Oh
Oh
Oh yeah
You, you say you really love me
I, I really really love you
Can we go back, can we go back
Back to yesterday
You, you say you really love me
I, I really really love
Back to the heart, back to the heart
But it's just a kiss away
Baby you, you say you love me
Then say that you're leaving
It's so deceiving
It's not the way that we planned it, we planned it
I don't understand it
All this time I believed in us
This new tomorrow's different
Oh no, help me comprehend
There's gotta be a reason why you're telling me bye
Why you say goodbye, yeah
Can we go back to yesterday
It's just a kiss away, oh baby
Say it on me, those things you say
It's just a kiss away, oh baby
A kiss away
I, I love you, I, I need you
My kiss away
Baby, I, I truly love you
So I'm second guessing what you're expressing
Are you really recruiting somebody new? Substituting my love
I don't believe or receive it
This new tomorrow's different
Oh no
Help me comprehend
There's gotta be a reason why you're telling me bye
Why you say goodbye
Won't you tell me please
Can we go back to yesterday? (Oh my baby)
It's just a kiss away
Oh baby (Oh my honey)
Say it on me, those things you say
It's just a kiss away, oh baby
I need you girl, I want your love
A kiss away, oh
I apologize for every lie
A kiss away
So much girl, I just, I just don't understand this whole circumstance in me
Baby baby baby
Ooh baby baby
I'm breaking down (breaking down)
I'm losing ground (losing ground)
Leave your shoulder to me, no, I can't take no more
Can we go back
Ah ah ah baby
Oh baby
Can we go back, ah ah ah baby, oh baby, ooh ooh ooh
Can we go back to yesterday, it's just a kiss away, oh baby, oh baby
Say it on me, those things you say, it's just a kiss away, oh baby
Can we go back to yesterday
It's just a kiss away, oh baby
Say it on me, those things you say
It's just a kiss away, oh baby
A kiss away
I kiss away, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I kiss away, na, na, na, na, na, na
Kiss away yesterday
I kiss away
