So what's this all about? I feel somewhat foolish
Can it be figured out? Maybe not, maybe it's useless
I don't know what to do
About the state I'm in
I should be so through with you
Just what is happening?
What am I thinking?
All day and every evening
Just what can I do?
I gotta get my mind over you
Please, is there a cure? (Is there a cure?)
Oh please, I can't take much more (I can't take much more)
Oh please, trapped in his love (I'm trapped in his love)
But why do I still feel the way I feel?
Why do I still feel the way I feel?
So where is my limit
I should've reached it by now
Logic is all twisted
I wanna stop but I don't know how
Is there any hope for me
I shouldn't want this at all
Somebody help me please
Get him out of my thoughts
I'll only end up high
And I know, and I know, and I know it won't work
But what, but what can I do?
I gotta get my mind off of you
Please, is there a cure? (Is there a cure?)
Oh please, I can't take much more (I can't take much more)
Oh please
I'm trapped in his love (I'm trapped in his love)
Why do I still feel the way I feel? (Why do I still feel the way I feel?)
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No, no, no
We all don't understand what this man has done to me
No, no, no, no, no, no
Believe me when I say that I tried to put that man out of my mind
What he did should be a crime
Desperate for comfort, I can't find that love of yours
Have me on the floor, begging for more, but with less hope
What's wrong with me, how can this be?
Does anybody hear my plea?
Is there a cure?
Please, I can't take much more (I can't take much more)
Please, I'm trapped in his love (I'm trapped in his love)
Why do I still feel the way I feel? (Why do I still feel the way I feel?)
