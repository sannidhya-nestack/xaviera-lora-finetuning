You know what, you know what
I got a confidence that I ain't'bout to betray
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When it's play time baby
You take the reins
And I hear you say
When you want it to begin
When you want it to end
Now I'm feeling the one and the same
But this is not your game, yeah
I don't want you to know I got a secret
Every time you're in control I let you believe it
If it keeps you in the show but I got a secret
And I intend to keep it just as long as you're with me
Last Friday night I said I'm sorry that I'm late
Baby I thought I was working honey
But I just love to make you
And you wait
But I know you'll feel better because you can say
When you wanted to begin
When you wanted to end
Now I'm feeling the one and the same
But this is not your game
I got a secret
I got a secret
I don't want you to know
Don't want you to know (I got a secret)
Yeah that means things ain't just what they seem
Every time you're in control (control)
And you believe it
Oh
Even keeps you in the show, but I gotta keep crying
And I intend to keep it just as long as you're with me
Well maybe I'm with you right now
But I keep on wondering why
When I asked you why you're so late
You couldn't even look me right in the eye
Did you think that all of these flowers (flowers)
Would make up for every hour (hour)
But I ain't gonna wait'cause I got a secret too
You're not the only boy I'm doing this to
When you wanted to begin
When you wanted to end
Now I'm feeling one and the same
But this is not your game
I've got a secret
You know what, I don't want you to know
But I've got a secret
Every time you're in control
My love, you better leave that
You know what, you know what, it keeps you in the show
But I've got a secret
I intend to keep it just as long as you're with me
You know what, you know what?
I don't want you to know, I got a secret
You know what, you know what?
Every time I'm in control, I let you believe it
Even gets you in the show, but I got a secret
You know what, you know what?
I intend to keep it just as long as you're with me
You know what, you know what?
You know what, you know what, you know what I mean
You know what I mean, yeah, you know, you know what, you know what
