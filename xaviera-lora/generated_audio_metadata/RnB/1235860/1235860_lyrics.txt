Live it for tonight, don't we chase our dreams back?
It's Christmas, it's Christmas
Live it for tonight
We chase our dreams like Christmas in the night
So soon
etting who we are
Every beat that you know
Takes us to new heights
In this electric playground
etting who we are
Every beat that you know
Takes us to new heights
In this electric playground
Can't live for tonight
Don't we chase our dreams back
So soon
So soon
Give it all tonight
We chase our dreams back
So soon, so soon
Feel now, feel now, feel, feel, feel, feel now, feel, feel now, feel now, feel, feel now, feel, feel, feel now, feel, feel now
Live it for tonight
Don't chase our dreams back this Christmas
The sun
Live it for tonight
We chase our dreams back home
The sun
Feel now
Feel now
etting who we are, where we be right now
Takes us to new heights in this electric playground
etting who we are, where we be right now
Takes us to new heights in this electric playground
Live it for tonight, don't be ashamed of soft dreams like this is the night
(Skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt skrrrt)
Christmas in the woods
Never thought tonight
Don't chase our dreams back
Christmas in the woods
Christmas in the woods
