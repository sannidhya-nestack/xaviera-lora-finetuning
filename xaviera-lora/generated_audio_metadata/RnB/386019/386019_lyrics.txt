All of my lessons have been learned
I omitted every useless word
My life is all from bits and pieces
And it makes me wonder
And it makes me wonder
I think I settled it all
I beat my head against the wall
The inner strength moves mountains now
And it makes me wonder
And then it makes me wonder
My confidence is burning out
Goes all I've ever known
As soon as you walk in the room
I hang on every word I know
This just sounds so absurd
As soon as I begin to crumble
Right in front of you
I've pulled my triumphs together
I gave up on our forever
I stop feeding you reasons and it makes me wonder
And it makes me wonder how
My confidence is blown and now goes all out
Ever known as soon as you walked in the room
I hang on every word I know
It just sounds so absurd as soon as I begin to crumble right in front of you
Why do you affect me so?
I'm spinning round from vertigo
Seeing love has made such a fool of me
You don't notice what you do to me, no
My confidence is burning out those all I've ever known
As soon as you walk in the room
I hang on every word I know
This just sounds so absurd
As soon as I begin to crumble
Right in front of
Right in front of
Right in front of you
And it makes me wonder
