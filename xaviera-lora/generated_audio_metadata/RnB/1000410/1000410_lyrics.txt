We've got to overcome, we've got to be strong
We've got to get it right, finally the day has come
We've got to bring along each and every one of us
It's now or never, let's go
We've got to overcome, we've got to be strong
We've got to get it right, finally the day has come
We've got to bring along each and everyone of us
It's now or never, let's go
We're gonna make a way
We're gonna make a way
It's now or never let's go
We're gonna make a way
We've got to overcome, we've got to be strong
We've got to get it right, finally the day has come
We've got to bring along each and every one of us
It's now or never, let's go
We're gonna make a way
We're gonna make a way
It's now or never let's go
We've got to overcome, we've got to be strong
We've got to get it right, finally the day has come
We've got to bring along each and every one of us
It's now or never, let's go
We've got to overcome, we've got to be strong
We've got to get it right, finally the day has come
We've got to bring along each and every one of us
It's now or never, let's go
