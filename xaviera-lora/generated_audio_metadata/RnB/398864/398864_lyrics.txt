Mmm, yeah
Sunny days
And mama's pink lemonade
Mmm, yeah
That's home
My daddy's in the backyard
Wearing out the barbecue
Don't you know
That's home
Everybody's comin' over Sunday night
Grandma's cookin' dinner so you know it's right
Uh huh, that's home
Wanna tell ya ain't nothin' like being at home
(I'm home)
There's nothing like being home
(Ain't nothing like)
Being at home
I'm so glad I'm home
I'm sitting on the front porch
Watching little Billy learn to ride his bike
That's home
And there's Mr. Jones
He won't leave that car alone
Oh no, that's home
Me and Kayla going out on Friday night
I know she's gonna wear her dress, it's way too tight
That's alright,'cause that's home
I got to tell y'all it ain't nothing like being at home
I'm home, it's nothing like being home
It ain't nothing like being at home
I'm so glad I'm home
There's no place like home
No matter what the people try to tell you
You're never alone
When you're at home
Cause sunny day makes me dance
Funny things that the home can bring
Every day I'm so glad I'm home, home, home
Yeah I ain't nothing like being at home, I'm home
It's nothing like being home (Ain't nothing like)
Being at home (I'm home)
Nothing like, never nothing like it (Ain't nothing like)
Nothing like being home (I'm home)
Nothing like being home, home (Ain't nothing like)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm home, yeah
I'm home (Nothing like, nothing like)
