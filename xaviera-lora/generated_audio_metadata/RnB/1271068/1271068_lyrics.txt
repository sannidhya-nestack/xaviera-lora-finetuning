Come let the rain fall down upon me
Not gonna duck for cover
Gonna keep it up, keep it up
It's one for another
Standing the flames with it, bro's shoulder
Carry the weight upon my shoulders
Never giving up, giving up
Cause it's one for another
I won't start giving in
Gonna love my inhibitions
I won't stop the dance, I won't cry
No, I'll face my fears
I know love is the message for a man on a mission
I don't lie
I know love is the message for a man on a mission, hey, whoa, whoa
I don't need no fancy Rolex, it's not the looks, it's the lover who keeps it up, keeps it up
It's one for another, I just believe that life is precious
Ain't nothing gonna stop me, never giving up, giving up
it's one for another, please don't start giving in
Gotta love your inhibitions (whoa)
And don't stop the dance, I won't cry (no)
I'll face my fears (face my fears)
I know love is the message for a man on a mission (man on a mission)
I don't make believe (no, no, no)
I know love is the message for a man on a mission
Love is the message for a man on a mission
Love is the message for a man on a mission
I won't start giving in
Gonna love my inhibitions
I won't stop to dance
Please don't start giving in
Gotta love your inhibitions
And don't stop the dance, I won't cry
Know I'll face my fears (I'll face my fears)
I know love is the message for a man on a mission (A man on a mission)
I don't make believe
I know love is the message for a man on a mission (I won't cry, I'll face my fears)
I know love is the message for a man on mission (I don't make believe)
I know love is the message for a man on a mission (for a man on a mission)
