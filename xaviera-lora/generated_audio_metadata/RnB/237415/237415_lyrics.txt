Your energy gets under me
I'm hopelessly infirm you see
I need a shot for this itch I got
Skin begins to need you baby
I feel the twins up in me baby
Feenin' just to know you better
I been meanin' just to write this letter
It changed
You're under me, but don't touch'em
It changed
To get over there to your heart
It changed
Oh, I really like it when you scratch'em
It changed
Oh, I'm here to try to strike your match
I'm sick with you
To be thick with you
It's all I crave
Baby you are all the rage
My skin begins to need you baby
I feel it twinge up in me baby
I'm feeling just to know you better
I've been meaning just to write this letter
It changed
You're under me
Don't touch'em
It changed
To get over there to your world
It changed
Oh, I really like it when you switch'em
It changed
Oh, I really try to strike a move
It changed
You're under me
Don't touch'em
It changed
To get over there to your world
It changed, oh, I really like it when you scratch
It changed, oh, I really try to strike your man
I is there for you
I is, I is there for you
For you, I is there for you
Born in a new age, yeah, yeah, yeah
Born in a new age, yeah, yeah, born in a new, born in a new
It's this scratchy bug I'm trying to catch
It's been a long time since I had a match
Who could patch me like a root
It's bulletproof, stiff like a tooth
It's that wig girl'cause it made it such
I wanna be a penny till I need a crush
I'm working so hard in the front backyard
I'm on your lawn and in a tune your car
I got adrenaline of ten strong men
But without you baby I'm weak and thin
What is the hold you keep when I'm awake and asleep
I see kaleidoscopes and spirochetes
With the lambs and the sheeps and the dirty sheep
And no need to rest, no need to eat
Don't wanna do a thing but scratch my itch
Please won't you tell me that you'd be my itch, my itch, my itch, my itch
My inch, my inch, my inch, my inch, my inch (my inch, my inch, my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch, my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch, my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch, my inch) (my inch, my inch, my inch) (my inch) (my inch, my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch, my inch yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, yeah yeah yeah yeah) (my inch, my inch) (yeah I love those boys) (yeah I love those boys)
