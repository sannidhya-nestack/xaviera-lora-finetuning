I would be missing this part of you
What if you only ran from behind
Or never looked up to see what's inside
What if you never smelled rain
Or felt reject or any kind of pain
What if you stayed in a box
And never tried something new
What if you never danced
Or only heard one tune
I would be missing the best part of you
I would be missing the best part of you
Would be missing
What if fairy tales were never told
Or laughing out loud was just too bold
What if anger was buried alive
Or passion was a word that no one could define
What if you never swam naked under the stars
Wouldn't your life feel empty from the start
I would be missing the best part of you
I would be missing the best part of you
The best part of you
This part of you
What if a crush only happened with grapes
Or cherries tasted of sand or some other thing
I would be missing
This part of you
I would be missing
Spot, the best part of you
I would be missing
Spot, the best part of you
I would be missing
Spot, the best part of you
The best part of you
I, I, I, I, I, I, missing the best part
The best part, the best part of you
