Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Lying in bed this morning
Couldn't get up to face the day
Listening to the pouring rain
Kinda felt like just lying there
Seems as though lately
I've been trouble feeling alive
Since you've been gone
This funny feeling
Like I'm falling (without you) right through the clouds
Like I'm falling (without you)
Whenever I go somewhere (wherever I go) people still think of us as one
And though I hold back the tears
I can't change things, what's done is done
Life without you
Has made my time stand still
Every day moves so slow
Seems to have this feeling
Like I'm falling
Without you (and I'm crashing)
Without you (like I'm falling, yeah)
Without you (and I'm laying down, yeah)
On the hardest rock
Turn the clock back
On the wall to the day when we first met
Way before the bride and before the fall
Let me live it again, I'll be better for a while
Gotta get back in the race
I'm tired of feeling so out of place
Looking for a clearer
In the middle of the pouring rain
Wish the sun would shine
So I could see the light again
I'm falling without you
And I'm crashing
(Without you) into the sea
I'm falling (without you) yeah yeah
From the mountain top
And I'm landing yeah
On the hardest rock
Without you (without you) I'm falling
I'm crashing out (without you)
I'm without you
From a mountain top to the highest rock that I've fallen
Without you
