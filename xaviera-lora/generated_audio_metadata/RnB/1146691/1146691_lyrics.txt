Sometimes
You might let the fear of striking
Keep you in the swamp
They say
The greatest glory in life
Lies are never falling but
In rising every time we fall
You let sadness keep you down
Learn to listen to what the voice of harvest tells you
You would realize sorrow's got nothing on you
Put on a smiling face
Wherever you may go
Put on a smiling face
Oh, that's something you can do
Put on a smiling face
Wherever you may go
Put on a smiling face
You see
You seem not to know how very special you are
Never let yourself get defeated
Learn to see failure as a movie
That will come to an end in no time
Put on a smiling face
Wherever you may go, put on a smiling face (oh, that's something you can do)
Put on a smiling face
Wherever you may go, put on a smiling face
Put on a smiling face, wherever you may go
Put on a smiling face, that's something you can do
Put on a smiling face, wherever you may go
Put on a smiling face
Oh, that's something you can do
All my people all over the world
That's something you can do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wherever you may go
