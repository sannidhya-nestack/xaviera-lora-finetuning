You walked into the party
Every girl's head was turning trying to catch your eye
So self assured
You didn't seem to notice you just passed on by
Oh, oh, oh
You cast a look when you glance my way
And your eyes they seem to say
Come play with fire, I can take you high
But you might get burned
Come play with fire to make you my desire
You don't mind getting burned
Now I'll admit, one look was all it took
I knew I wanted you
Though I bet you could have any girl that you wanted to
Oh, you got me wondering where to draw the line
when your eyes hit mine
Listen, come play with fire
I can take you high
But you might get burned
Come play with fire
Tonight you're my desire
You won't mind getting burned
Ooh, what's this I see?
You're talking to some girl instead of me
Oh, oh baby, ooh
Sneak attack, you turn and double back, heading my way
You asked my name and would I like to go some place to get away, oh, oh, oh
You said you're gonna give me so much more than you ever gave me before
Come play with fire, I can take you higher (ooh, baby)
You might get burned, oh
Come play with fire, tonight you're my desire
You are my getting burned, oh
Come play with fire, can you take me on?
But you're my getting burned, oh
Come play with fire, tonight you're my desire
You are my getting burned
Come play, come play
