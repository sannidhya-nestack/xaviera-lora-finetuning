Traffic is bad today
As people are gone astray
City streets buzzing as we speak
I open my eyes to see
The splendid simplicity
Of the afternoon
Made for you and me, yeah
And I wanna be truly in love
Not just a fleeting feeling of
And I wanna feel all that is you
All that is real
And I wanna be
Oh yeah
Let's see what's in store for us
And hop on this lover's bus
Take a ride, leave this town behind
Hey, and I wanna be truly in love
Not just a fleeting feeling of
And I wanna feel all that is you, all that is real
And I wanna be truly loved
Not just a fleeting feeling of
And I wanna feel all that is you
All that is real
And maybe I have
Told you before
But I'll say it once more
The sun doesn't shine without you
I wanna be truly in love
Not just a fleeting feeling of
And I wanna feel, wanna feel all that is you
All that is real, yeah
And I wanna be truly in love
Not just a fleeting feeling of
And I wanna feel all that is you inside of me
'Cause I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
