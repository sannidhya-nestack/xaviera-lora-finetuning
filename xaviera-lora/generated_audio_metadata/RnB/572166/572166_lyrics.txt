I figured I would stretch my legs and spread my wings
I figured I'd just walk right out and find better things
But the fateful consequence a bad decision brings
It's something you live with, it's something you die with
I thought that I could live without you, what a foolish plan
I thinkin' that it was over before it even began
And now I see your satisfaction comin' from another man
That's somethin' I'm livin' with, that's somethin' I'm dyin' with
I said that I'd start over with somebody new
I said it right to your face, baby
I said I don't need you, whoa
It was easier said than done
It was easier said than done
Like dodging bullets from a Tommy gun
It's just easier said than done
Well here I see you all dressed up
You got some place to go
Don't tell me what his name is
I don't even wanna know
Oh baby you sure are the right
To go ahead and crow
That's something I live with
That's something I'm dying with
But baby there's one more life in this whole nine lives care
I think I finally found a heart, I'll show you where it's at
Oh baby you ain't never known true love like that
It's something we can live with, it's something we can share together
But don't take my word for it if you have any doubt
Just go ahead and walk away
You'll be sure to find out, whoa
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
Thinking you got too much love
Pretty soon you got none
Baby, it's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
It's just easier said than done
Like dodging bullets from a Tommy gun
It's easier said than done
Oh yeah, easier said than done
You just say how they don't
