You always liked your mama's cooking
She makes a bomb, bread, beans and rice
I asked your mama for the recipe
But it never seems to turn out right, though I tried
And I'm not the one you run to
And I'm not the one you like
Who you like, yeah
The other night while you were sleeping, yeah
I kissed your cheek and said goodnight, ooh, yeah
Oh, my, my, my
I used to have a nice complexion
My body took you for a ride, oh yeah
You said that I'm no longer good looking, yeah
And I can't believe my, my, mine
I'm not the one you run to
And I'm not the one you like
The other night while you were sleeping, hey
I kissed your cheek and said goodnight (goodnight)
I'll pack my things and I'll be gone (goodnight)
No need to say that's what you want, no (Goodnight)
Boy, I can see it in your eyes (Goodnight, goodbye)
You told me I was wrong for the last time (Goodbye, baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Bye bye baby, baby
Goodnight, let's make it easy, make it plain
Goodnight, it's time to dream, it's all the same
Baby, I can feel it when you smile (Goodnight, goodnight)
This lullaby is on for the last time (Goodbye, baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Goodnight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You told me I'm telling you goodnight
