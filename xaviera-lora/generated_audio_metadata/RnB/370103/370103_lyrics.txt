Call Annie, tell'em I'm on my way home
Call Annie, tell'em I'm on my way home
I done spent that money and I can't stay here no more
Call Annie, tell'em not to be mad
Oh, call Annie, tell'em not to be mad
Well, I was doing so well and all my good luck done gone bad
And they gave me money to pay the rent
But I woke up this morning and no money was spent
Well, I rolled into town on that Saturday night
My money was gone before the early light
Call Annie
Say I'm on my way home
Oh, oh, oh, call Annie
Say I'm on my way home
I done spent all my money and I can't stay here no more
And he gave me money to pay the rent
But I woke up this morning and that money was spent
I rolled into town on Saturday night
But my money was gone before the early light
I called Annie, said I'm on my way home
Oh, oh, oh, I called Annie, said I'm on my way home
I done spent that money and I can't stay here no more
Oh, calling it
Telling not to be mad
Oh, calling it
Telling not to be mad
I was doin' so well but all my good luck done gone bad
Oh, call Annie
Oh yeah, call Annie
Oh, call Annie
Hey, Annie
Call, call, call, call Annie
I'll call, call Annie
Hey, call, call, call Annie
Hey, call, call, call Annie
Oh, oh, oh, oh
