Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand year itch of hella hot desire, well
Let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so fly, you have to get an airplane seat
At what cost? Lost a pretty penny
Come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch, one come to the sweetness
Own this money, you're one sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore or miss money?
Now you got a little would you like a little more or miss money?
Sweet little honey I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute check your mobile tell me if you got my text
Fights are both a mess and I can see that you been messing with some things
I think you think that you never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is very very very catty
Buying up the love, it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
A swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard, in the market for a heart
Oh, oh miss money
Your fantasy I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend maybe you're a wife
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
Oh, she's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, a water portfolio
But dividends of love she'll never really know
Oh miss money, your fantasy
I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher
With the cold in touch but the cost of love
It seems too much miss money oh
The irony's not lost can't lodge it for love
It's an endless cost now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
Fiscal failure torn apart
But oh miss money you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night oh
Oh miss money
Your fantasy I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Miss money oh
