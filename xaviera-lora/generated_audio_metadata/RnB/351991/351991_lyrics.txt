Stand, I got to, got to, got to stand
Stand, stand up for something
I don't know what I mean
Stand, damned if I do
And doomed if I don't
That's the way of the world (that's the way of the world)
Three steps forward and two steps back
That's the way of the world
Why is lady misery always hanging round
That's the way of the world (that's the way)
Why is mister unhappy trying to bring me down
That's the way, I gotta put my feet on the ground and hang
Stand up, got to stand up (stand up)
if you don't stand up for something
You'll fall for anything
Stand up, got to stand up (stand up)
'Cause if you don't stand up for something
Who will fight for anything?
Stand up
Got to stand up (stand up)
if you don't stand up for something
Who will fight for anything?
Stand up (stand up)
Stand up
Do you hear me, what I'm saying?
I'm gonna keep my boat afloat
Destiny won't tip me over, no
That's the way of the world (that's the way of the world)
One day I'll walk upon the fields of fall leaf clover
Yes I will, that's the way of the world
Black don't crack and that's a fact
And you can't get your money back, no, no
That's the way of the world
This show, nothing's the truth
And if you're feeling like I do
It's all left up to you
There's only one thing left to do, you stay
Stand up, got to stand up, stand up
Cause if you don't stand up for something
You will fall for anything
Yes you will not stand up
You got to stand up, stand up
Cause if you don't stand up for something
You will fall for nothing
Oh yes you will stand up if you don't stand up for anything, oh yes you will stand up if you don't stand for anything, oh yes you will stand up if you don't stand up for anything, oh yes you will stand up if you don't stand up for anything
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up (stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up)
All you fuck, you can't beat me (Do you hear me, hear what I'm singing?)
Stand up (I'm singing, got to stand up)
Stand up (I got to, got to, got to stand up)
I got to, got to, got to stand up (All you fuck, you can't beat me)
All you fuck, you can't beat me (I'm telling you, I stand up in the morning)
Stand up (Stand up in the evening)
Stand up (I stand up at lunchtime)
Stand up (I'm standing up all the time, I'm standing, standing up)
Stand up (Stand up, I got to stand up)
Stand up (I got to)
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up (I got to stand up, oh yes I will, yes I will, yes I got to stand up, got to stand up, stand up, stand up)
Do you hear what I'm saying? Do you hear me what I'm saying? Do you hear me what i'm saying?
