You can't run, you can't hide
That's what she says before she pushed me on the floor
But she don't care, no
That look in her eyes
It's so primal baby, all I want is more
But she don't
She hooked me with just a hit, got something I can't resist, damn she's so X rated, I can't help it, nobody's innocent, I know that you're provocative, so fucking provocative, so don't give me love
But love ain't what I need
She can be, she can be all I need tonight
I'm too deep inside of it
But I love the way it feels
She can be, she can be all I need tonight
And she's provocative, provocative tonight
Prova krevo, prova krevo
Oh then she said come here, come closer
Strip me down until I lost my senses
No she don't care
I won't et the moment I found her
That curve on her body
All I know is that she knocked me senseless, yeah
She can never get enough, no
She caught me with just a hit
Got something I can't resist (yeah)
She's so excited
I can't help it
Nobody's innocent
I love that you're provocative
I love that you're
She don't give me love
But love ain't what I need
you can be, you can be all I need tonight
I'm too deep inside of it
But I love the way it feels
you can be
You can be all I need tonight
she gives me what I need
Oh, she got me on my knees
I'm strung out every night
You're provocative
She kicked me with just a hit
Got something I can't resist
I love that you're provocative
You don't give me love, but love ain't what I need
You can be, you can be all I need to, yeah, I'm true
Too deep inside of it
But I love the way it feels
You can be, you can be all I need to know
Cause you're provocative
You're provocative
Provocative, yeah
