Excuse me, am I hearing this right?
You wanna ask me something that you never ever asked before
You saw this girl she was walking on the street your eyes met
She looked so fine
And now you're asking me to free my mind and let her in our bed
Let me think about it, hell no (hell no) no, no (no, no) no way (no way) no, no, no, no, no, no
Let me start by saying hell no (hell no) no, no (no, no) no
No way, no, no, no
I wasn't dreaming
And yet I wake up in the middle of the twilight zone
Is there anybody out there who can tell me what is going on?
Did I fall down?
Did I hit my head and bump into your heart of stone?
Am I talking to a black hole?
Are you getting what I'm saying?'Cause I sure ain't wrong
Didn't you hear me say hell?
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, you know
Do you really think that I am easily persuaded?
No, I don't care if she got the curves of a Spanish guitar
The bottom line is I ain't kissing no one for your pleasure
So get a life, boy
Stop banging, start accepting that you ain't gotta have it your way
you know my answer, hell no (hell no)
No, no (no, no)
No way (no way)
No, no, no, no, no, no
Didn't you hear me screaming, hell no (hell no)
No, no (no, no)
No way (no way)
No, no, no
Now was I dreaming?
Did I wake up in the middle of the twilight zone?
Is there anybody out there who can tell me what is going on?
Did I fall down?
Did I hit my head and bump into your heart of stone?
Am I talking to a black hole?
Are you getting what I'm saying?
Cause I sure ain't wrong
(All night, all night, all night, all night, all night)
How was I dreaming?
And did I wake up in the middle of the twilight zone?
Is there anybody out there who can tell me what is going on?
Did I fall down?
Did I hit my head and bump into your heart of stone?
Am I talking to a black hole?
Are you getting what I'm saying?
I sure ain't wrong
Didn't you hear me say, "Hell no" (hell no)
No
No, no, no way, no way, no, no, no, no, no, no
Didn't you hear me screamin' hell no, hell no
No, no, no way, no way, hell no, hell no
I ain't kissin' no one for the rest
No, no, no, no way, oh no
