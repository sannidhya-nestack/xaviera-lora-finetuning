If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one man
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one man
Reverse the progression of the hands of time
Open up the gateway between you and I
Find another way to remain not apart
Unleash and express words
Trapped in my heart
Love you for you
Not for, not for who you should be
Show just how much
I miss you constantly
Make love to you
Like each time's brand new
Spend all of my life and time loving you
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend (my best friend)
And I would learn from you all that I can (all that I can)
To be your everything in one man (one man)
If I could do it all over again (do it again)
You would certainly be my best friend (my best friend)
And I would learn from you all that I can (all that I can)
To be your everything in one man (one man)
Explore hidden passions held deep within
Bring to life, bring to life, bring to life, bring to life the fire within
Let's not waste any time, strengthen the love that binds
Seek within your heart and soul
If I could do it all over again You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one man
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one way
If I could do it all over, right away, steady
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one man
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And soon I would learn from you more than I can
To be your everything in one man
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything, your one man
If I could do it all over again
You would certainly be my best friend
And I would learn from you all that I can
To be your everything in one man, in one man
Reverse the progression, love the, love the hands of time
Open up the gateway between you and I
Find another way to remain not apart
Unleash and express words trapped in my heart
Love you for you, not for who you should be
Show just how much I miss you constantly
Make love to you like
Each time is brand new
Spend all my life and my time loving you
