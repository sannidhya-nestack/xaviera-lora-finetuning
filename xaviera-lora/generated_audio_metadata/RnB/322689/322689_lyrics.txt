One, two, three, four
Baby, baby, what happened to you?
I saw you last night, working at the blacklight
I knew you were looking good with the pearls on your neck and the boys at your back
Black boots and a purple nightgown made it all come together while the club was breaking down
I saw you never deviate
From the pole you're positioned for sure to agitate
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby with your technique
You got the body
You got mystique
You drive me crazy baby with your physique
Baby love I've been wondering where you came from
Where you been where you at are you oh such a wild cat
Something sexy bout the way you take control of my soul
With your smile and your toss it up style
Scintillating with your sweet nastiness I'm in love
With your magical, flexible fitness
I saw your body, I saw your body
When I met you in the lobby
You're seductive to the core
With your sexual rapport
You got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby
With your technique
You got the body
You drive me sneak
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
Why do I wash and count as new?
Swallowed my coffee, feel like I'm in the middle
Not a body, not a body, but within you
Wonder where the pants come from, I wonder if I'm new
How do I crack my head to a new?
Hands can't follow my bum, but who?
You got the pie
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby with your technique
You got the body, you got mystique
You drive me crazy baby with your physique
You got the body, you're such a freak
You drive me wild baby with your technique
You got the body, you got mystique
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique, you got the body
You're such a freak, you drive me wild baby
With your technique, you got the body
You got mystique, you drive me crazy baby
With your physique, you got the body
You're such a freak
You drive me wild baby
With your big dick
You got the body
You got mystique
You drive me crazy baby
With your physique
