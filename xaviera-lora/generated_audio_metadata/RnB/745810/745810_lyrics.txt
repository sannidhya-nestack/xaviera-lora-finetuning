I can trace my emotions, track my feelings each and every day
I can watch how I walk, slow up my talk in every way
I can try to keep what I feel deep inside of me
But being around you seems to be what I need, yeah
So I'm giving up this fight
Just to save my own life
I'm declaring this loss my victory
This love is real
This love is chill
This love makes everything in life about you
This love is right, straight out of sight
And I can't imagine it being about nothing else except about you
Time and time again I have made friends
And they have stayed friends
They were just not for me
So nothing against them
So this time around I have landed on high ground
I cannot lose I can only win
This love is real, this love is true
This love makes everything in life about you
About you, about you
This love is right straight out of sight
And I can't imagine it being about nothing else except about you
About you, yeah, yeah
About you, about you, hey, hey, hey (This love is real)
This love is chill (oh, oh)
This love makes everything in life (everything in life)
About you (about you, about you, about you, hey, hey, hey)
This love is right, straight out of sight
And I can't imagine giving up on it
