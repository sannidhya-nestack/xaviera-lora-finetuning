It's just like they're here, but not outside the door
Party, but I just need my girl with the moon
World outside, cooking, cigarette my sweet
All that much food, so it just needs
So many things to share
Even though you think that you'll never see it
Now you say Morocco, that takes a smile
Haven't seen Morocco for a long while
The dreams are rolling down the clock, they're still in my mind
I've just had a day
Dreams are rolling down across my mind
I've just had a day
So let it take me there
Even though you think that's what you said
Now you say Morocco, that makes me smile
Haven't seen Morocco, all along while
Know that I'm the one that I'm meant to be
'Cause I know that there's still something there
But you take the rock off and make me fly
And as I'm getting back, you make me cry
Know that it takes a devil
Need to know you think we're free
Now you say Morocco, that makes me smile
Haven't seen Morocco, long, long while
Dreams are rollin' down my mind
I've just had a baby, yeah
It's your heart, it's your heart
It's your heart, and it has to fly
You're alive, you're alive
Floating, floating, floating high
I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go, I'm not gonna let you go
You're the one who's got me feeling like I'm dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
'Cause I know that there's still something there
But you said goodbye, baby, bye
Hasn't been that easy, long, long while
