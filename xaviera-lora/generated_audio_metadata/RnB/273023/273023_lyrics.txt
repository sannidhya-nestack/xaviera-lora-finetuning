A kiss of a lifetime ease
A kiss that dispels your fears
When they touch to and fro
You can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime ease
Expectation of please
Energy has your aura glow
Then you had a kiss of a lifetime
A moment of clarity
Your kiss means that to me
Clear as the waters, deep as the sea
Delicate and so sublime
Full on you blow my mind
It feels so good it must be a crime
This kiss that you give has such an effect
I lose my way and I don't have time to catch my breath
This kiss that you give has such an effect
If there's a day without it, it's a fate worth the death
A kiss of a lifetime is a kiss that dispels your fears
When they touch, to and fro, you can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime is expectation replaced
Energy has you all aglow, then you have a kiss of a lifetime
Entwined in your embrace, I lose all time and space
It's so profound just a lipstick trace
Caressed and so unexplored
Nothing can be ignored
I want it bad if this time is sure
This kiss that you give has such a need for
I lose my way and I don't have time to catch my breath
No this kiss that
You can't have such any fun
If there's a day without it it's a fate worse than death
A kiss of a lifetime ease
A kiss that dispels your fears
When we touch to and fro
You can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime ease
Expectation will please
Energy has your aura glow
Then you had a kiss of a lifetime
A kiss of a lifetime ease
A kiss that dispels your fears
When they touch, to and fro
You can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime ease
Expectation, no please
Energy has you all on glow
Then you head back inside
A kiss of a lifetime, can't be defined
A kiss that makes one lose space and time
Outstanding, that's what you are to me
We go together like one and two and three
That is always and forever
You love me and leave me never
Look these are the things that define what it is to have
A kiss of a lifetime, a kiss of a lifetime it is
A kiss that dispels your fears
When we touch, to and fro
You can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime is
Expectational please
Energy has your aura glow
When you had a kiss of a lifetime
A kiss of a lifetime is
A kiss that dispels your fears
When we touch, to and fro
You can't help but let yourself go
A kiss of a lifetime is
Expectation, no please
Energy has you on a glow
Then you had a kiss of a lifetime
