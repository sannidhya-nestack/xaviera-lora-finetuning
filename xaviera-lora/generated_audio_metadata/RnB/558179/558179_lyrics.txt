Here we are (here we are)
Holding hands (holding hands)
Standing tall (standing tall)
Woman, man (woman, man)
You walked the aisle
But the journey was long
Just to get here
We laughed and played, cried and smiled
Fought our way through ups and downs
But there is nothing that can hold us down
Let's stay together (together) forever (forever)
Just me and you is the best we do
Let's stay together (together) forever (forever)
We vow to stay this day
Let's stay together (let's stay together)
Forever, just me and you, it's the best we do
Let's stay together, forever, we vow to stay this day
Everything is gonna be alright
Well, we got each other to depend on
When the days are long and there are lonely nights
Well, we got each other to depend on
We'll raise our girl, we'll be a family (family)
We'll show the world just how true love could be
So on this day (on this day) I will make a claim (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Forever it will be you and me
Let's stay together, forever
Just me and you is the best we do
Let's stay together, forever
We vow to stay this day
Let's stay together, forever
Just me and you, it's the best we do
Let's stay together, forever
We vow to stay this day
Forever, just me and you is the best we do
Let's stay together, forever, we vow to stay this day
Let's stay together, forever
Just me and you, it's the best we do
Let's stay together, forever
We vow to stay this day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
