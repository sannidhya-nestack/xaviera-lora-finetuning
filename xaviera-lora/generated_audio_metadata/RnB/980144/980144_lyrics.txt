Some grown folk hip-hop, you know what I mean?
Hip-hop love song
Dig this
Wanna see that pretty smile
You be spinnin' around so I can admire you
Anything you need, babe, let me know
Let me know
Wanna see that pretty smile
Please turn around so I can admire you
Need to see that pretty smile
Ooh baby
Day to day
I can't get by
Without your smile
I ain't gone lie
Without your smile
My day don't go right
I need your smile
And then I'm alright
Overdrive
That's how you get my gear
All the time
That's how much I want you near
What you need
Just let me know it's you I need
Just don't let me go, I was made
Just for you, you were made
Just for me too, life is good
Love is us, first Corinthians 13
Four through eight, that's us
Wanna see that pretty smile
We spin around so I can admire you
Anything you need, baby, let me know
Let me know, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wanna see that pretty smile
You be spinnin' around so I can admire you
Mm, mm-mm
Need to see that pretty smile
Ooh, baby
My world revolves around you and
I declare here and now all your wishes
All your dreams I can make them come true
Count on it count on me over the sky
I see the rainbow over your pretty head
I see your halo, you're my special angel
Sent for me, grateful for this angel
Meant for me, I soak it all in
Put my hand all in
I got the winning hand
Take my winnings and move on
I got the prize
The prize is you
Starin' at me with those pretty eyes
I wanna see that pretty smile
We spin around so I can admire you
Anything you need, babe, let me know
Let me know
I wanna see that pretty smile
Don't be spinnin' around so I can admire you
Need to see that pretty smile, ooh, baby
(Drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop)
