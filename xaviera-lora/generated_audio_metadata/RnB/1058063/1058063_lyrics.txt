Now now now now
And here we go again
Done heard it all before
I can't play this game no more
The phone call I received said that we're over
And the things we used to do will be no longer
There's always something going on with you girl
But I'll try to keep the promise that I made ya
But it's all on you, oh yeah yeah
But it's all on you, oh yeah
Keep on doing the same thing, the same thing
Keep on doing the same thing, the same thing
To keep on, to keep on doing the same thing
I keep talking like you're listening
But it still don't mean a thing
But I would've given you the world
But it wouldn't have mattered
But I was out of control
Thinking we would've flowed
But all I heard
It's the same words
But it's all on you
Oh yeah girl
But it's all on you
You keep on doing the same thing
The same thing
You keep on doing the same thing
The same thing
Cause I keep on it
Cause I keep on it
Cause I keep on doing the same thing
So I can't do this no more
I can't do this no more
My baby, oh my baby
I can't do this no more
I can't do this no more
No more, no more
I keep on doing the same thing
The same thing
You keep on doing the same thing
The same thing
you keep on,'cause you keep on,'cause you keep on,'cause you keep on

'Cause you keep on (you know)

Doing the same thing, yeah
