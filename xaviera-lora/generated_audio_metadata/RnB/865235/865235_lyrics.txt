Well sometimes you just wanna be right
Thinkin' all the time that you wanna be free
But you never know you wanna be sad
I'm makin' a mountain and you wanna flee from me
When I'm lovin' all the time
Thinking on the ride, what's saving the time
But lose your roots, you probably can't even
But everything you want is so
Get down honey
Feel real low
Get down honey
Cause I feel real low
Get down honey
Feel real low
Get down honey
Cause feel real low
So every time you wanna be just right
I thinkin' every day you wanna be so free
And I'm makin' all the chances right
A time to time I make you make another me
When you're livin' on you say
One of the love and ain't no wanna be alone
That's the key just to go to go away
And everything you say is true
You get down honey
I feel real low
Get down honey
'Cause feel real low
Get down, honey
Feel real low
when you're rising right from yourself
You'll keep me growing
Well, I just think I've seen
Time and time again
I wanna be free
But you never wanna be so free
And every time you think in a mess about your head is down and running down the low
Everything you want to say which is what the room up in me what you want to care
I care what don't mean love I won't get down honey
But feel real low, get down honey
Cause feel real low, get down honey
So feel real low
'Cause when you're rising above yourself
You're keeping me growing
Get down honey
Feel real low
Get down honey
feel real low
Get down honey
feel real low
when you're rising above yourself
You're keeping me growing
'Cause when you're rising above yourself
You're keeping me growing
when you're rising above yourself
You're keeping me growing
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Be real low
Get down honey now, yeah
Be real low
Get down honey
Be real low
'Cause when I rise above the sun
You keepin' me growin'
Oh, honey
Oh, play it now, play it
Oh, play it loud, the band will follow
Higher
Be real low
Get down, honey
