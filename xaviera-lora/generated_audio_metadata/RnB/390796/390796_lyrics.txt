Uh, uh, yeah, oh yes, oh yeah
Boy, I know that it can be kinda hard to handle me
When I slip in my moves
I'm working hard trying to make a way
It gets kinda crazy
Feeling misunderstood
We gotta hold on tight and make things right
Honey you know that I know you so well
There's nothing you can do but say to push away all of the love
The love that I have for you, hear me say it
When you are found in such trouble, there ain't no doubt
No, we can't work it out (No, we can't work it out, nah)
But I'm concerned with you (I've come to learn, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, we can't work it out (We can't work it out, yeah)
