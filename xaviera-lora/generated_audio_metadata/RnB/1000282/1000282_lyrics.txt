Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Haven't got away, oh you know
Wondering if you know
I miss you the most
Couldn't be real this time
I just wanna ease my mind, yeah
Wondering if you hear me
Crying at night
They say it gets better with time
But I don't know about that this time
If life were like the movies, you'd be right back (right back)
If life were like the movies, we couldn't have that
If life were like the movies, you'd be right here (right here)
But until then, I'ma shed these tears, said I'm
Torn into pieces, torn to pieces over you
Torn into pieces
My heart is torn in two yeah
Torn into pieces
Torn to pieces over you
Torn into pieces
My soul is torn in two yeah
Heaven couldn't wait this time
Heaven couldn't wait this time no
Heaven couldn't wait on you
Heaven couldn't wait on you no
Heaven couldn't wait this time
Heaven couldn't wait this time
Said I'm torn into pieces
Torn to pieces over you, yeah
Wanna hold you
Wondering if they know you
Wanna see you
Just gotta be near you
I don't believe
That they'd really make you leave
Can't believe it's real
Don't know how I feel, yeah
Wanna hear your voice for the one time
Wishing I could give more of my time
Wishing I could see your face just once more
That'll change a thing I'm hurting to my core
Said I'm torn into pieces, torn to pieces over you
Torn into pieces
My heart is torn into, yeah
(Torn into pieces, torn to pieces over you)
(Torn into pieces)
My soul is torn into, yeah
Heaven couldn't wait this time
Heaven couldn't wait this time, no
Heaven couldn't wait on you
Heaven couldn't wait on you
No, no, no, no
Heaven couldn't wait this time
Torn into pieces
Torn to pieces over you, yeah
Heaven couldn't wait this time, no, no
Heaven couldn't be this dark, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I'm torn into pieces, torn to pieces over you, yeah
