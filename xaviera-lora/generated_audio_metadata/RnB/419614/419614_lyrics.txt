Yeah, let's feed that
Come on
Oh, yeah, baby
Black sphere
Don't wanna be too bold, no
You are the epitome
Of the type of girl I want next to me
You're everything I'll ever need
I'll hold you so close I'll never leave
I'm getting tired of sitting by
Watching you get hurt by some random guy
You deserve unconditional love
I wanna be the one to make it right
I know that we're friends and all but I've
I've known you for so long
Baby girl you need a real man I'll never do you wrong baby
I know that we're friends and all but I've
I've known you for so long
Baby girl, you need a real man, I'll never do you wrong, baby
All I wanna do is treat you right, hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man, I hope that I ain't being too old
All I wanna do is treat you right
Hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man
I hope that I ain't being too bold
You've grown to be a big part of me
So when I see you cry, I can hardly breathe
What happened to that pretty smile?
Baby, back in the day it just drove me wild
And when you left, it tickles me
Baby, with you is where I gotta be
You deserve unconditional love
I wanna be the one to make it right
I know that we're friends and all but I've
I've known you for so long
Baby girl you need a real man I'll never do you wrong baby
I know that we're friends and all but I've
I've known you for so long
Baby girl you need a real man, I'll never do you wrong, baby
All I wanna do is treat you right, hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man, I hope that I ain't being too bold
All I wanna do is treat you right
Hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man
I hope that I ain't being too bold
Now the last thing that I wanna do
Is overstep my bounds with you
But you need to know the truth
The truth is I love you
Now the last thing that I wanna do
Is overstep my bounds with you
But you need to know the truth
The truth is I love you
All I wanna do is
Treat you right, hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man
I hope that I ain't being too bold
All I wanna do is
Treat you right, hold you tight late at night
All I wanna do is be your man
I hope that I ain't being too bold
