What's a man without a woman
A fire without a spark
Where would man be without a woman
Laying cold and in the dark
We are breathed because of mothers
And we're loved because of lovers
So fathers, tell your daughters to be strong
So what's a man without a woman
He's not without the dead
Oh where would man be without a woman
Still searching for the way
We are brave because of mothers
And we love because of lovers
So fathers, tell your daughters to be strong
Where a woman makes a man shine
Guards him over the line
She makes everything worthwhile
Time after time after time
So what's a man without a woman?
Justified without a spark?
Oh where would man be without a woman?
We be laying cold and in the dark
We all breathe because of mothers
And we love because of lovers
So fathers, tell your daughters to be strong
Cause what's a man without a woman?
Yeah, what's a man without a woman?
Tell me, what's a man without a woman?
Yeah, what's a man without a woman?
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
