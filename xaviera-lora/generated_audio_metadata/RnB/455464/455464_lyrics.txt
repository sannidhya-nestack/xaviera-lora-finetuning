I feel so strange today
Inside this space I'm floating
I know I can't control you
With all my senses knowing
It's dark, it's safe
I feel a river flowing
I think it's time, I think it's now
I'm reaching out for the wild
The rhythm of your heartbeats
Brings on a sense of knowing
From the inside outside
I feel your love is growing in time
I'm turning over and over
I think it's time, I think it's now
I'm reaching out for the wild world (love me, love me, love me, love me, I)
Wild world
Love me, love me, love me, love me, I
Out of the darkness
Into the light
I'm inside you
Sensual and right
Color my mind
Color my life, give me time
Spin me out of my mind
Love me, love me, love me, love me, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (woah)
Love me, love me, love me, love me, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, love me, love me, love me, love me, I
Love me, love me, love me, love me, I
Love me, love me, love me, love me, I
You're gonna love me, love me, love me, love me, ah
