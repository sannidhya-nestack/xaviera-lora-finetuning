And all these tears around the glass of my home
You said you want to say but you really had to go
And now I'm by the phone waiting for your call
And this weight is killing me
I wish my tears could be like diamonds
And so the price to pay would be too high for you
I wanna feel so fine
You made me lose my mind
For all this time
Oh oh oh
And now I need to be free
Passion's gone and gone (passion's gone and gone)
And I lose my mind feeling inside out (feeling inside out)
I can only say what my heart would tell you if it were on my behalf
And it's just goodbye
And all the tears you saw were my vanity
The words you hear from me have got the priority
I do this only
It's just because I'm keen on
My vanity
My family said
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I need to be free, passions come and go (Passions come and go)
And I lose my mind, feeling sad (Feeling sad)
I can only say what my heart would say if it were on my behalf
And it's just goodbye (I need to be free, passions come and go)
And I lose my mind feeling inside out
I can only say what my heart would tell you if it were on my behalf
And it's just goodbye
You made me lose my mind
You made me lose my mind
You made me lose my mind
For all this time, I'm waiting for tomorrow to hear your call
And it's now or never, I know how to be stronger
After all the pain that I've gone through
And now it's just to be through with me
I need to be free, passions come and go
And I lose my mind, feeling sad (feeling sad)
I can only say one more word, tell you if it were on my behalf
And it's just goodbye
I need to be free, passions come and go
And I lose my mind feeling inside out
I can only say what my heart would tell you if it were on my behalf
And it's just goodbye
