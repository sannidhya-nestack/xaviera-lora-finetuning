I could've went left
Something told me go right
It was no chance to encounter
That place around my side
I was only here
But she took me right there
I had no idea
Of the kind of love we share
Never thought that I
Was a lucky guy
But somehow
I wound up with her love
Must have been a hand
A hand held upon me
Upon you
From up above it had to be a hand
A hand upon me, upon me
From up above
Used to think that life was a hit or miss
But surely someone ordered the sweetness in her kiss
No twist of fate
Or happenstance
Allowed me to partake
In this heavenly romance
Time and time I ran it all through my mind
And the only answer that I could think of
Had to be a hand
A hand, a hand upon me, upon me
From up above
It must have been a hand
A hand upon me, upon me
From up above
Must have been a hand, a hand upon me, upon me
From up above, I know it was a hand, a hand upon me, upon me
From up above, it had to be a hand, a hand upon me, upon me
From above, what else but a hell of a bondage, a bondage
From above, I bet it was a hell of a bondage, so sweet, so deep, so sweet
So completely on there now
A hammer upon me, upon me
