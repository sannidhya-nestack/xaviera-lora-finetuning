You're right, you're right, you're right
And I was completely wrong
When you told me that I had been a fool
And I'd be sorry someday, oh
Please, please, please, please, please, please
Hear what I have to say
Before you call it a day
Here's my confession to you
Oh oh
I put my hands up, I'm guilty
I know I'm to blame
You see baby, I, I took your love for granted, yeah
Again and again and again and again and again
That running around with chasing after the skirt was just part of being a man
But baby, I brought tears to your eyes
I want you to know from the bottom of my heart
Baby, I apologize
You're right, you're right, you're right
And I was completely wrong
When you told me that I had been a fool
And I'd be sorry someday, oh, oh
Please, please, please, please, please, please
Hear what I have to say
Before you call it a day
Here's my confession to you
Oh baby it's just me and you and I wanna give you the lowdown
I wanna tell you exactly how I feel here tonight
You see when you said to me
You can't have your cake and eat it
The truth is I was eating cake all over town, you know that baby but uh
You caught me in a lie
And it turned my life upside down darling
When you told me that you didn't want me no more
But you see I can't blame you one little bit, I won't do that
You see, I realize now that I deserve all the pain I can get
You're right, you're right, you're right
And I was completely wrong
When you told me that I had been a fool
And I'd be sorry someday, yeah, oh, oh
Please, please, please, please, please, please
Here's what I have to say
Before I call it a day
Here's my confession to you
