I'm just a lost girl in the big world
And I can't see what's in front of me
Heading down the winding road
I got my beds packed and my boots on
Leave this old shack, moonlight, flip and run
Getting out on my own
I'm so confused
I don't know if I'm crazy or sane
What should I do?
I'm out of my mind, I need to be saved
I need to be saved
I'm just a lost girl in the big world
And I'm on the edge, just a nervous wreck falling down
The slippery slope
And now I'm hell bent on a mission to seek
Gotta find myself an identity
there's no doubts
There must be hope
I'm so confused
I don't know if I'm crazy or sane
What should I do?
I'm out of my mind, I need to be saved
I'm waiting to be saved
Will you save me, will you save me, will you save me, oh
I'm so confused
I don't know if I'm crazy, you're saying what should I do?
I'm out of my mind, so help me, I'm confused
I don't know if I'm crazy, you're saying what should I do?
I'm out of my mind
I need to be saved
I need to be saved
I'm just a lost girl
I'm just a lost girl
