Bring some meaning for the hell of it
We've been aching for some spoken word changing it
I've been waiting for the smoke to lift
And I'll be coming to you by the end of it
Do you feel it now? Do you feel it now?
We're running past the meridian
Do you feel it now? Do you feel it now?
Running courtrooms and quotidians
Do you feel?
Nobody's all praise for the boy now
On your new pictures they'll go on now
The days are getting really slow now
No disease, no release
No disease, no release
Hey
A woman in flesh
Seems so foreign now
Breathe through the mesh
Don't fall sickly now
Oh every day's a pain
Oh when you're spanned it all away
From your home field kinda place
But you make it work anyway
So I'm asking you when you stay
Do you feel?
Ha!
Nobody's all praise for the boy now
On your new pictures they'll go on now
The old museums have all sold out
No disease, no release
No disease, no release
Theon, do you theon?
Theon, do you theon?
Nobody's all praise for the boy now
On your new pictures look go on now
The days are getting really slow now
No disease no release
No disease no release
