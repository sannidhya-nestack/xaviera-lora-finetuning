You know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue devon sky
Where dolphins come to play
You watch the clouds passing by
By
And every time I leave
A part of me stays here
Again a brighter day
And you know it feels so good
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
Is it living by the sea?
You know you're gone
Under a blue sky
Under a blue sky
You know it
You know it
You know it feels so good
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue sky
I came out brighter day
And you know it feels so good
You know it feels so good
You know it feels so good
Out in the sunshine feels so good
Down on the beach you know it good
Out in the sunshine feels so good
Easy living by the sea
We know it, we know it
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Easy living by the sea
We know it, we know it
