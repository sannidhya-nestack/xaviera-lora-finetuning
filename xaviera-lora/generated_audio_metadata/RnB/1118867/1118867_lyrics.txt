Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your boy feel like dancing
Oh what a night for sweet romancing, oh
When you're close around me
I wish that you could see what I see
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Boy you are so fine it's criminal
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Boy you are so fine it's criminal
You boy feel like dancing
Oh what a night for sweet romancing
When you're close around me
I wish that you could see what I see
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Oh you are so fine it's criminal
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Boy, you are so fine, it's criminal
You, boy, feel like dancing
Oh, what a night for sweet romancing, oh
Won't you close around me?
I wish that you could see what I see
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Boy you are so fine it's criminal
You are something true and original
Like a shooting star so unreachable
You make me wanna touch the untouchable
Boy, you are so fine, it's criminal
