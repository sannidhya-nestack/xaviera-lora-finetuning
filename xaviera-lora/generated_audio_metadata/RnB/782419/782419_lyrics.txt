We all need some changes
(Changes)
We all need a change (Nothing changes)
Baby I feel you just the same
Nothing changes in this game
As long as we're still hanging around
Baby, I feel you're just the same
But don't play me like some game
This honest system still should remain
Nothing changes, nothing ever changes
Nothing changes, nothing changes in this world
Nothing changes
Oh, when you're hassled on the street
Make effort who you meet
You're related, frustrated or simply stated
We all struggle just to live
Need some time just to care
Maybe we can bring this all together, yeah
Nothing changes, oh no
Nothing will ever change (nothing changes)
Ooh, it always stays the same (and nothing changes)
Nothing will ever change (nothing changes)
Nothing will ever change (nothing is gonna change)
No, no, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We all know there is never any real change, yeah
Yeah, yeah
We all need some type of loving
We all need some special care, oh-oh
When will you come to your senses?
I won't always be standing here
Nothing changes, nothing really ever changes
In this world, nothing changes
Nothing changes (never change, never change)
Nothing changes (changes, ooh)
Nothing changes (when they say it changes)
And nothing changes
Nothing, nothing ever changes
Nothing, nothing changes
Nothing ever changes
Nothing changes
Nothing changes
And nothing changes
Nothing changes (Nothing changes)
