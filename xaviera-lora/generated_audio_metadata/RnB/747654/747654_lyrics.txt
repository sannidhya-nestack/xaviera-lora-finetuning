You started with the lies and I can't tell you nothing
Will this ever change
That make up to the break up story of our lives it ends in shame
Don't cry for me cause I'll be right here riding through the waves
Just one last kiss
This is cold love
Light the propane
Light the propane
Ignite my fire
Ignite within
What we used to have has blown out in the wind
Light my fire
For you and I
Won't you please, oh baby please
Give me one last try
Tell me who you're chasing
The man or your dream
Been down this road before
And I know just how it ends
Never what it seems (It's not what it seems)
Don't cry for me, cause I'll be right here
I'll make it through the day
Just one last kiss, this is cold love
Like the propane
Ignite my fire, ignite within
What we used to have has blown out in the wind
Light my fire
For you and I
Won't you please, oh baby
Please give it one last try
You push and you pull
You run and you fight
You can make it wrong
But you won't make it right
The story of our lives
You can push and pull, you can run and fight
You can make it wrong, but you will make it right
The story of a life
The story of a life
Ignite my fire, ignite within
What we used to have has blown out in the wind
Ignite my fire for you and I
Won't you please, oh baby, please give it one last try
Ignite my fire, ignite within
What we used to have has blown out in the wind
