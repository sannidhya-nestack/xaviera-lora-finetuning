So, you've been suffering so long
In the water so deep, in a blue way
Memories closed, you've been closing your doors
An attempt to withstand, all the pain you say
Some people et their own troubles
Some people know that the times will pass in these dark days
Slow, so your days they move slow
Oh the sun it floats onward to a cruel day
Then it turns dim, oh the shadows they grow
And your heart it beats so slow like a weed on your chest
Some people et their own troubles
Some people know that the times will pass in these dark days
Some people et their own troubles
Yeah, some people know that the times will pass in these, these dark days
In these dark days it will pass
And these dark days it will pass
Oh these dark days it will pass
And these dark days it will pass
