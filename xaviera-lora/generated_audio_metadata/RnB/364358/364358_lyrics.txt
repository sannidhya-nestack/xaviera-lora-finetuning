You got the kind of lovin' I can hold here in my hands
Let me squeeze you baby, let me be your lovin' man
Hey baby, you drive me crazy
You know it takes two to rock and roll
And I need you to satisfy my soul
Baby, you drive me crazy
When I need a little lovin'
I want you by my side
Jump inside my Cadillac
Take me for a ride (hey)
Baby, you drive me crazy
You know it takes two to rock and roll
And I need you to satisfy my soul
Baby, you drive me crazy
Come on baby, let's get together again
I got the place, I got the time
Baby just tell me where
Peaches and cream and honey in the pot
Shake it to the jukebox put the money in the slot
Hey baby, you drive me crazy
You know it takes two to rock and roll
And I need you to satisfy my soul
Baby, crazy
Come on baby, let's get together again
I got the place and I got the time
Baby just tell me when
Peaches and cream, honey in the pond
Shake it to the jukebox, put the money in the slot
Hey baby, you drive me crazy
You know it takes two to rock and roll
I need you to satisfy my soul
Baby, you drive me crazy
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
It takes two to rock and roll
