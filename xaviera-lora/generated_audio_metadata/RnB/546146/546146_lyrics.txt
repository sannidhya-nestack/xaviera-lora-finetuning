I want him next to me
Just like a dream
Opened near to me
He's all I'll ever need (I'll ever need)
Come next to me (Come next to me)
Be next to me
Tired of keeping secrets down inside
Don't wanna keep pretending
Don't wanna hide
Look inside
And maybe then you'll realize
It's no surprise
Cause you can read it in my eyes
There's no other place I'd rather be
There's no other face that I wanna see
only he can make my heart miss a beat
He's all I need
Come on, be next to me, be next to me
I want him next to me
Just like a dream
Open it to me, it's all I'll ever need (I'll ever need)
Come next to me (come next to me)
Be next to me
If I could plan the future, I want it there
Take away the pain, I cannot bear
Because I care, how could it be so unaware
But if I dare, there's so much that we can share
I'll tell him there's no place I'd rather be
There's no other face I wanna see
only he can make my heart skip a beat
He's all I need
Come on, be next to me, be next to me
I want him next to me (be next to me)
Just like a dream (like a dream)
Over near to me (be still)
I'll ever need (I'll ever need)
Come next to me (come next to me)
Be next to me (come on, come on)
Next to me (next to me)
Next to me
Come next to me (come next to me)
Be next to me
Next to me, next to me, next to me (next to me, next to me)
Be next to me
If he would come my way
Maybe he would stay
Forever and a day
Next to me
Next to me
Come on, be next to me, be next to me
I want him next to me
Just like a dream
Over near to me (ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Please don't
I'll never need (I'll never need)
Come next to me (come next to me)
Be next to me (come on, come on, come on, come on)
I want him next to me (be next to me)
Just like a dream (like a dream)
Over near to me
Please stop, I'm living this, I'm living this
Come next to me, come next to me, be next to me
Come next to me, come next to me, come next to me
Come next to me, come next to me, come next to me
