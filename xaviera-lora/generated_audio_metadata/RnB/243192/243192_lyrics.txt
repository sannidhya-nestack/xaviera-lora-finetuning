Diamonds and things
And maybe even pearls don't ring
What I need
There's something even deeper in me
I got your picture on the wall
I can't take it down, not at all, oh no
Keep thinking'bout all the times we shared
Can't help wanting it to come again (I must be dreaming) (Must be dreaming)
Oh, not the love that I thought I would feel
Wishing it would be between us again
Knowing how I need you (Knowing how I need you)
All I can do now is keep your smile around
I got your picture on the wall (I got your picture on the wall)
On our access that you would call (on our access that you would call)
What am I gonna do?
If I can't be with you (If I can't be with you)
Things come and go
But love is something you should know
The way your heart is filled with it
Nothing else compares to it
Remember those walls through the parkway
Our passion didn't want to stop, oh baby (I must be dreaming)
Must be dreaming (of the love)
Wishing it would be (wishing it would be)
Between us again (knowing how I need)
Knowing how I need (knowing me and you)
It's all I need to know (mmm, yeah)
Is if you're still around (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I got your picture on the wall (got your picture on the wall)
On our access that you would call (on our access that you would call)
What am I gonna do?
If I can't be with you (be with you)
You give me that thing I need (that thing I need)
You make me want it again and again (oh, I want your baby) being your baby, yeah (yeah)
I don't know if I'm able to go on anymore (without you, it's insane)
So come and give me what I need this second (no, I ain't gonna let go)
I got your picture on the wall (got your picture on the wall)
All I ask is that you explode
Now listen, you know that I love you
And I can't see myself going on without you
So let's stop all this mess
Maybe we could get some coffee or something, and talk about it, you know what I mean?
(Just keep on smiling around me, dreaming)
I need to see your face (of our love)
(I love the way you move)
I need to be with you baby (between us)
No matter how far we are from each other (no matter how far we are from each other)
