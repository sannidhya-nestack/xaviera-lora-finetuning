But it's a beginning and it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
If the first shot of a story turns out
To be completely unrelated
So here we are with vanilla in the air
Vanilla in our glasses
And vanilla in our minds
A second shot is all we need in this story
To let the characters wait
For one of them to break the silence
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
For there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
And from this song this cool vanilla is all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling you
I'll let you try for make less do understand
For there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling you
I'll let you try for make less do understand
And from this song this full of vanilla is all you'll have
The night is getting dark and no one's gonna move (by the beginning)
My glass is empty and there's no need to talk (it doesn't matter)
et rock baby
Never mind the indecence
If we move on
For just another trip on these
There's no end of this
And you've probably noticed
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
For there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think I'm not telling y'all
I'll let you try from my glance to understand
And from this song this cool vanilla is all you'll have
And if you think I'm not telling you (I'm not telling you)
I'll let you try for necklace, do I understand? (This cool vanilla is all your head)
The best song to lead in every story after all (And if you think I'm not telling you)
I'll let you try for necklace, do I understand? (I'm not telling you)
And from this song this cool vanilla (This cool vanilla is all your head)
Is all your head
And if you think I'm not telling you
And if you think I'm not telling you
I'll let you try for my class to understand
For there's no need to live in any story after all
And if you think
