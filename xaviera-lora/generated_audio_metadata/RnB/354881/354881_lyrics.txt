I'll do anything (baby)
I'll do anything (baby)
I'll give you everything (baby)
If I could just hold you tonight
It doesn't matter whether near or far
If you need me I'll always be there
Oh, I don't care who may have your heart
Just reach out and I'll understand
So if you must turn away
I won't stand by and hold you back
No, there's just one thing that I want to say
So don't leave before I tell you
That your love is all I've prayed for and I'll do anything (baby)
I'll do anything (baby)
I'll give you everything (baby)
If I could just hold you tonight
And if you must leave, if you're out that door
And you find that what you had is what you need
Oh, just come on back and I'll love you once more
I'll give you everything, I'll get down on my knees
I just need you to understand
That you are all that's within my heart, oh
Darling, I wanna be your only man
So don't leave before I tell you
That your love is all I pray for
And I'll, I'll do anything
Oh, I'll do anything
I'll do anything
I could just hold you tonight
I'll do anything
I'll do anything
I'll do anything
If I could just hold you tonight
I'll do anything
I'll do everything (baby)
Oh, I'll do anything (baby)
Oh, if I can just hold you tonight
Oh, I'll do anything (baby)
Oh, get down on my knees and beg (beg)
And beg for you to come back to me
I'll do everything (baby)
Oh, if I could just hold you tonight (ooh)
I, I'll do anything (baby)
I'll do everything
Baby (I'll do anything)
Baby (Oh, if I could just hold you tonight)
