You can't peel the paper from my soul
But if you scratched a little bit
You just might see it all
I can't afford to take the risk this time
Scared I won't survive
All the past I've mounted up
Heart's still in such a grind
The last time that I failed
I learned my lesson well
This time I'm gonna keep my heart safely wrapped up
The next time I won't fall
Don't wanna give my all
This time I'm gonna keep my heart safely wrapped up
You can't scrunch me up inside your hand
But if you squeeze it tightly, I could give to it some air
Don't wanna lose my dignity this time, scared I won't survive
All the past has messed me up, so I'm taking such a grind
The last time that I failed, I learned my lesson well
This time I'm gonna keep my heart safely
Raptor, the next time I won't fall
Don't wanna give my all
This time I'm gonna keep my heart safely
Raptor, safely
Raptor, safely
Raptor, safely
Raptor, safely
Raptor
You can peel the paper from my soul
But if you scratched a little bit
You just might see it all
I can't afford to take the risk this time
Scared I won't survive
All the past I've mounted up
Heart's still in such a grime
The last time that I fell
I learned my lesson well
This time I'm going to keep my heart safely wrapped up
The next time I won't fall
Don't wanna give my own
This time I'm gonna keep my heart
Safely wrapped up
The last time that I fell
I learned my lesson with
This time I'm gonna keep my heart
Safely wrapped up
The next time I won't fall
Don't wanna give my own
