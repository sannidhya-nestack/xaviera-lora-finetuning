Got to control my weakness
I know that you're out of your mind'cause you're
Dirty, downright facetious
Pretend to my mind I'm aware that it's
One time, vanish forever
No longer to leave me never will you learn
You can't take no for an answer
Leave me alone why don't you leave me in peace
You got me on my back foot
Don't ask anytime for your end good
Hell no, I didn't want to lack that
Brace up my mind for combat
At last, take you completely
Never again to be betrayed as was Jesus
From Judas, a kiss
It all comes down to this
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
Hear my battle tactics
Subverted, moving, and then I'm going to break down
Leave you paralytic
I'm gonna surround, I'm gonna cut off your supply
To every station
To leave you bewildered and you're scattered around with
No demarcation
Reject to reject till I have you begging me please
No time for plea bargains
What on earth are you asking?
You don't really like this
You're condemned, you are dismissed
You got nothing to give me
And now's the time that I wanted for you to
Bend down and see
It all belongs to me
I've had some total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I've been taking my time, but reading the signs
I didn't know whether I was losing my mind
I tried to teach ya, I tried to school ya
You got into your head, I was trying to fool ya
When will you learn that I've got you beatin'?
Open your eyes and recognize the beat
Of when you're talking, of when you're lying
When to give in, you were wildin'
Got to control my weakness
I know that you're out of your mind
So it's the time for you to go
Let the record show
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
I have total control
