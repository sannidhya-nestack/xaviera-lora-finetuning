I push you through the pain
I'm on a mission, got my eyes on the prize
No intermission, gotta keep on going
Never looking back, I'm a fighter, ain't no time to slack
Walking on the edge
But I'll never fall, I'll rise above it all, standing tall
Got determination running through my veins
I won't stop now, no time for games
Every step I take I'm getting closer
To the dreams I've had since I was coaster
Gonna prove them wrong, show'em I'm the one
Won't give up, I'm never done
Walking on the edge, but I'll never fall
I'll rise above it all standing tall
Determination running through my veins
I won't stop now no time for games
