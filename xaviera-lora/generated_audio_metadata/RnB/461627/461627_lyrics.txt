Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lock the doors and throw away the keys
Oh dear lord I need relief
I woke up this morning in a dark hotel
The last night's foggy though it's just as well
Everyone around me wants a piece of cake
The more I give well the more they take
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Yes, I'm standing at the crossroads
Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lock the doors and throw away the keys
Oh dear Lord, I need relief
Seems to me there was a simpler time
A life by the water, pianos and wine
The children were young, not a care to be found
Illusions that I've buried deep underground
Just sitting on the doorstep
We were sitting on the doorstep
Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lock the doors and throw away the keys
Oh dear lord I need relief
Life's been a party, the fun never ends
As long as I'm buying, I'm surrounded by friends
But no one's listening, nobody hears
Alone in a crowd that I've run with for years
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Yes, I'm standing at the crossroads, yeah
Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lock the doors and throw away the keys
Oh dear Lord, I need relief
Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lord there's crazy people dancing in the streets
Oh dear lord I need relief
Crazy people stepping on my feet
Crazy people know where I sleep
Lock the doors and throw away the keys
Oh dear lord, I need relief
