Now you mean nothing to me
Now you mean nothing to me
Now you mean nothing to me
No matter what you say or do
You will find me
Too bad
Second chances, oh
There's no way for parting
On good terms, no, no
It's more than the wind I'm coping though
You always left me drowning in cold
Baby how I miss, how I miss your touch
You used to be mine
Now you mean nothing to me (Now you mean nothing to me)
Now you mean nothing to me (It's really over now)
Now you
It's over in my heart
I got you, you, baby
Heart chains breaking
And these walls don't mean a thing
you ain't got me
Did you ever hold my hand?
Come to my little meltdown
Have to be all that you wanted
I've got to be free and needed
Now you mean nothing to me
Now you mean nothing to me
Now you mean nothing to me
No matter what you say or do
It's over in my heart
It's over, it's over, oh
No matter what you say or do
