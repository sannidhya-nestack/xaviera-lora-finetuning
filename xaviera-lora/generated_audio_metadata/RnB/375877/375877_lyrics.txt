Life is such a crazy thing to me
When you're walking you can't find nobody else
You're walking alone, there's nothing, nothing by your side
And you got me feeling like, I don't know whether to live or die
I'm asking myself, should I keep on walking down these lonely streets
Cause I'm asking myself where to go and I can't seem to fall asleep
Gotta keep on walking
I gotta keep on walking down these lonely streets
I'm all alone
Can't next can't see no home
Si te estoy yo llamando
Porque te estoy deseando
No te tengo a mi lado
Si te estoy yo llamando, porque te estoy deseando
No te tengo a mi lado, y te sigo buscando
I'm walking down this street
And it's all dark at night
I don't understand
Just why I can't make things right
Gotta keep it going baby
Gotta keep on walking lady
Cause I'm looking for help
And I can't seem to find nobody else
Gotta keep on walkin'
Gotta keep on talkin' to myself
Got me feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
Oh life, life, life
Can get a little crazy
Life, life, life
Si te estoy yo llamando
Porque te estoy deseando
No te tengo a mi lado
Si te estoy yo llamando
Porque te estoy deseando
No te tengo a mi lado
Y te sigo buscando
Asking myself one day where I was gonna go
Contemplating on some things in my life and nothing ever seemed to go away
And yet I had to sit back and relax and tell me where to go
Mama papa told me son you gotta take it slow
I'm walking down this street and it's all dark at night
I don't understand just why I can't make things right
Gotta keep it going baby gotta keep on walking lady
Cause I'm looking for help
And I can't seem to find nobody else
Gotta keep on walking
Gotta keep on talking to myself
Got me feeling like I'm going crazy
Oh life life life
Can get a little crazy
Life, life, life
Oh, can get so crazy
