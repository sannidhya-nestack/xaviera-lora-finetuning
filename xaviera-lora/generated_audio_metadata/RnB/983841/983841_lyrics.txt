Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Pretty, pretty
Everybody knows where all them boys go
Go for a smart girl with a good heart and sweet personality
So it doesn't bother me
That he found himself a Barbie
With the legs just like the palm trees
Sun kissed with them big lips
Six feet standing over me
You, you
No, you don't know what you got into (Pretty, pretty)
Ain't she walkin' like a model (Pretty, pretty)
But you had it from your mama (Mama)
Ain't she some believable, I'm invisible
Pretty, pretty awful
Pretty, pretty
Ain't she walkin' like a model?
Pretty, pretty
But you had a free mind then
Ain't she some believable? I'm invisible
Pretty, pretty awful
32A on a good day
But you know you love my big brain
My emotions get the gas goin'
You won't ever need your space
All I need's your assets
I'm'bout to step back'cause I'm a classic K
So call me right back, you're in void
With your sheets orange
You still want me, you just don't know it
You, you, no, you don't know what you got into
Pretty, pretty, ain't she walkin' like a model
Pretty, pretty, but you had it from your mama
Ain't she some believable, I'm invisible
Pretty pretty awful
Pretty pretty
Ain't she walking like a model
Pretty pretty
But you had it from your mama
Ain't she something believable
I'm invisible
Pretty pretty
Oh make'em laugh
I treat'em right
I was the top of my class
Yeah, I'm the kind you wanna wipe off
She pretty, pretty
Ain't she walkin' like a model?
Pretty, pretty
Budgeted for your mama
Ain't she some believable?
I'm invisible
Pretty, pretty, ain't she walkin' like a model?
Pretty, pretty, but you had it from your mama
Ain't she some believable? I'm invisible
Pretty, pretty awful
