Quiet moments when it's just us here
No words, only the sound of our breath so clear
Time stands still when you look at me
Like a dream we don't wanna set free
Let everything fade out, all we have is now
No thoughts, only peace in you somehow
Darkness falls softly in the light
In your arms I find my way right
Long shadows dancing on your skin
You smile softly, everything's within
Nowhere to be, nowhere to go, just us two
While the night turns blue
Let everything fade out, all we have is now
No thoughts, only peace and you somehow
Darkness falls softly, we're in the light
In your arms I find my way right
In a world of noise, we're an isle
Silence sings and we listen, oh wow
When time melts away, it's just you and me
Right here, right now, letting all things be
Let everything fade out
All we have is now
No thoughts, only peace and you somehow
Darkness falls softly
Or in the light
In your arms I find my way right
In a world of noise, we're annihilated
Silence sings and we listen, oh wow
When time melts away, it's just you and me
Right here, right now, letting all things be
Let everything fade out, all we have is now
No thoughts, only peace and you're somehow
Darkness falls softly, we're in the light
In your arms I find my way right
Quiet moments when an eye's just us here
Everything we wish for we have near
