I'm a thighs on New York chick
Detroit blood, you can call me a tiger
I'm on the prowl, I'm revenues
East coast love, I'ma, I'ma reach higher
East coast, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want another gentleman, no
I want the ones who've been hustlin', yo
Brooklyn boys are a little rude (I like)
Eastern European up a avenue (what's up?)
And don't take this the wrong way
There's something special about L .A.
Midwest got the bad boys too
If you ain't real bad, I don't fuck with you
I need a real bad boy (real bad, real bad)
We ain't poppin' bottles in the club
We in the penthouse of love
I need a robot boy, he good, but he's bad for me
Sitting tight in the curved flames
From the Bronx down to Wall Street
Hop into your car, yeah I like that shit
Sitting down on FDR, yeah I like that
You a top floor on your elevator shit (that's why)
I need a five star New York guy
I'm a good girl but I wanna make money
I'm on that non stop New York ride
No other boys doing anything for me
It's cause yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I want houses to flip with you yeah
I want cars I can drip with you yeah
New York streets are little me
But New York boys I don't want for me
And don't take this the wrong way
There's something special about L .A.
Midwest got the bad boys too
If you ain't new, I'm bad, I don't fuck with you
I need a real bad boy, you bad, but it's good to me
We ain't popping bottles in the club
We in the penthouse of love
I need a room for my boy, he good but he's back for me back
Suit and tie and I'm cuffed, from the Bronx down to Wall Street
I love how he do
What he do
He's so bad
He's so
I need a real boy
Boy, boy

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Supin' tight in a Cubs nose
From the Bronx down to Wall Street
