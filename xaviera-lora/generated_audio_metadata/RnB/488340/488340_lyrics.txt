There has got to be somewhere out for me
Blue skies turning to grey
Changing everyday
Things are going my way
Roadways move so slowly
Time it goes so fast
I got to build foundations
So they're gonna last
Everything that I do must be right, must come true
Gotta make my statement
Got to live a mind
Suddenly I can see just what I'm gonna be
It's my destination
I'm coming from the dark
And there has got to be somewhere out for me
Blue skies turning to grey
Changing every day
Things are going my way (things are going my way)
(Things are going my way)
There has got to be somewhere I can see
Feel it's going to stay (going to stay)
Changing every day
Things are going my way
Things are going my way, things are going my way
Things are going my way, things are going my
Feel it getting stronger
Courage that has grown more
Stays with me much longer
And then I'll never know
All the ifs and the buts crumble down in a dust
How it used to shake me
Now they're out of bounds
Got a feeling inside all this that won't be mine
Got a chance I'm taking
While the time is right (The sky to be)
There has got to be somewhere I fall be
Blue skies setting the grey
(Valence conscious) changing everyday
Things are going by the way (things are going by the way)
There has got to be somewhere I can see
Feel it's going to stay (going to stay)
Changes every day
Things are going by
There has got to be somewhere I'm on me
Blue skies down the bay
The balance gone just change in every day
Things are going by
There has got to be somewhere I can see
Blue skies down the bay (things are staying)
Change in every day
