Dr. Slay, press play (Simone)
Won't you get a taste of a goddess?
Won't you get a taste?
Yesterday I went and got my toes done just for you
Purple, yellow, pink, green, orange, black, white, all blue
These the type of things that a woman go through
Thinking'bout a man'cause she really wants him to notice everything
Tuesday got my hair done
Wednesday took a break
Thursday had a Zoom meeting
Friday beat my face
Now it's Saturday (I love Saturday)
And I'm waiting for you (I'm waiting, I'm waiting)
In June
And I like it, I like it
The way you make me smile (the way you make me)
Wait'til I return the favor
So do you like, do you like words of affirmation or do you like the touch?
If I send you gifts, am I doing too much?
Simple acts of service or quality time?
If you share your love language, I tell you mine
Thank you for your kindness, can I have a kiss?
Yes I love these flowers, I can make your favorite dish
Way you blow my mind, understand it truly
We can scratch each other's heads while we watch a movie
Love the way you're sending us when you're not around
I'll keep your dimples on when you try to hide your smile
you're not used to
Showing emotions (emotions, emotions)
Fill me up with logic when you try to pick my brain (pick my brain)
I be doing dumb shit like never take the blame (take the blame)
Try to blow you off when I act like I'm not listening (you really know)
Knowing damn well that I be really listening (you really know)
Like Monday got your hair cut, Tuesday bought some shoes (oh yeah)
Wednesday with your homeboys, Thursday order food
Now it's Friday night (you love Friday)
And you waiting for me (you waiting for me)
And ooh, and you like it, you like it
The way I lift you up, so you can hold us down
Treat you like the king you are, hell yeah
Like words of affirmation and I do love to touch
You can send me gifts, never doing too much
I love extra service and quality time
You show me your love language, I show you mine
Thank you for your kindness, can I have a kiss?
Yes, I love these flowers, I can make your favorite dish
When you blow my mind, understand and true me
We can scratch each other's heads while we watch a movie
Now you got a taste of what God is
