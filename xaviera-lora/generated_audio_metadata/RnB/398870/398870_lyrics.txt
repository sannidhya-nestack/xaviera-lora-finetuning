You say that it's a lost cause
Baby how can that be
I try to keep my head
But I'm barely holding on
By a single thread
But soon it will be all gone
I'm trying to keep my soul from giving up the ghost now
Girl that thing just keeps on calling me
Calling me, yeah I'm
Whoa, whoa love I think I'm losing my mind
Whoa, whoa I keep on walking I know I'm simply wasting my time
When I lay down and search for all the peace I can find
Find me a daisy and leave all this illusion behind
You say I never listen to you
But I heard you loud and clear
You say I hear what I want
You confirm my worst fear
You talk about this end game and it tears me up inside
I'm trying to find a ray of hope but the truth can't be denied
Searching for a way just to say a flow now
Looking for someone to pull me off the boat now
Trying to keep my soul from giving up the ghost now
Girl that thing just keeps on calling me
Calling calling calling calling
Whoa whoa love I think I'm losing my mind
Whoa whoa I keep on walking but I know I'm simply wasting my time
Seems like all I can do is lay down and search for all the peace I can find
Go find me a daisy and leave all this illusion behind
Whoa, whoa, losing my mind
Whoa, whoa, wasting my time
Whoa, whoa, the peace I can't find
Whoa, whoa, illusion behind
Whoa, whoa, losing my mind
Whoa, whoa, wasting my time
Whoa, whoa, the peace I can find
