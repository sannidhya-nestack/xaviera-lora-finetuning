You were told to accept all that happens to you
But how can I abide when it makes me so blue?
It changes my life, my mood, my relations
It's a spot on my soul of my own creation
Howling to my pillow, bawled all night and all day
I beseeched God for help, but he led me astray
Wherever it came from, one thing is for certain
I did not even love him, barely cared for his person
Was he being truthful, or was he being unkind?
Was he being deceitful all known due time
Why was I so foolish why was I so dumb
It led me to a battle that cannot be won
So then why am I led with this gift so sublime?
Makes it hard to connect with the power divine
My Uncle Mike once chided me, "Girl, don't ask those questions
Can't ask why, who, or how,'cause God won't make concessions"
Instead, ask God plainly, help me to understand
Help me see why this happened, and then you'll see his plan
Soldiers won't open mines,'cause there ain't no clear reason
Why you'd abandon me, someone commit such treason?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So perhaps there's some good reason unbeknownst to me
That God wants me to know, to understand and to let be
Or perhaps there's nothing like this fall of caprices
Perhaps things just happen and you pick up the pieces
The pieces, caprices
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
