Only when your heart breaks
Only when you cry
That's when you say you love me
Just before you think that I'm saying goodbye
Only when your heart breaks
When your heart breaks (only when you cry)
That's when I know you love me
When you're heartless and you're mine
All those times we wasted
There could've been so much more
But you were busy running all over town
And didn't stop to read the score baby
Now you're coming on so strong
Claiming your love is real
Before the threat of me walking away (walking away)
Feelings you will never reveal (only when your heart breaks)
Only when you cry
That's when you say you love me
Just before you think that I'm saying goodbye
Only when your heart breaks
Only when you cry
That's when I know you love me
And suddenly you're mine
So many nights I'd reach out for you
And you just turned away, oh
But now there's nothing that you would do
To keep me from leaving today, oh
But now you're coming on so strong
Claiming your love is real
Before the fate of me walking away
The feelings you would not reveal
Only when your heart breaks
Only when you cry
That's when you say you love me
Just before you think that I'm saying goodbye (goodbye)
Only when your heart breaks (when your heart breaks)
Only when you cry, baby
That's when I know you love me (love me)
And suddenly you're mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, only when your heart breaks
Only when you cry, baby
That's when you say you love me
Just before you think that I'm saying goodbye (goodbye)
Only when your heart breaks (when your heart breaks)
Only when you cry
That's when I know you love me (you love me) (you love me)
And suddenly you're mine (only when)
