Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
I'm so into you I can't take myself out
Everything I want, it's so wonderful I find them in you
I seem not to understand how
You make me wanna stay with you all day
And I don't wanna let you go now
I really have to find a way
To make you stay
I want all of you
And nothing less, I need all of you
And no one else, anytime you touch me
I get shivers (shivers) anytime you touch me (I get shivers, shivers)
I want all of you
And nothing less, I need all of you
And no one else, anytime you touch me (anytime you touch me)
I get shivers (shivers) anytime you touch me (oh oh oh oh)
I get shivers (shivers)
Baby, you bring Nirvana to me
When your hands are massaging
Baby, this our love is like a battle
And you always have a way to win
I seem not to understand how
You make me wanna stay with you all day
And I don't wanna let you go now
I really have to find a way
To make you stay
I want all of you
And nothing less, I need all of you
And no one else, anytime you touch me
I get shivers, anytime you touch me
I get shivers, I want all of you
And nothing less, I need all of you
And no one else, anytime you touch me
I get shivers (I get shivers)
Anytime you touch me
I get shivers, shivers
Baby
I want all of you
And nothing less
I need all of you
And no one else
Anytime you touch me
I get shivers
Anytime you touch me
I want all of you and nothing less I need all of you and no one else anytime you touch me I get shivers any time you touch me I get shivers shivers
