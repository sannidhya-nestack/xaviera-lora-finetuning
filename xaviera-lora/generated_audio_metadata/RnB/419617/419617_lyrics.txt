I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby, this is for you
I can't always say what I feel
Cause I know it's supposed to be taken slow
But this track here
Is just the tip of the iceberg
Of how I really feel about you baby
I'm ready
Baby I'm ready so when you need me just call
Baby I'm ready I wanna give you my all
Give me your heart, babe, I'll suppress your pain
I got so much love to give, girl
I'm ready, I'm ready
Three o'clock in the morning
I'm up staring at these four walls
Wishing you were here in my arms
Got a lot on my mind these days
But it's too late for a call
I guess instead I'll write you a song
I can't wait until that day
That you're here with me
Instead of miles away, baby
But pen and pad just won't explain
How much I love you babe
Although you're so far away
Baby I'm ready so when you need me just call
Baby I'm ready I wanna give you my all
Give me your heart, babe, I'll suppress your pain
I got so much love to give, girl, I'm ready, I'm ready
I feel so helpless sometimes
Like when you say that you're tired
Instead of massaging your feet
I'm forced to sit back and weep
Oh when you're feeling so lonely
I know that you need me
I know that you're strong, boo, but
We all get weak too
One day I'll be there
One night I will stroke your hair
One morning I'll kiss you here
One evening I'll touch you there
I know we're taking it slow
I can't lie that sometimes
This distance has its toll on me (baby, I'm ready)
So when you need me just call (baby)
Baby, I'm ready, I wanna give you my all (give you my all)
Give me your heart, babe, I'll suppress your pain (I'll suppress your pain)
I got so much love to give, girl (oh yeah)
I'm ready, I'm ready
Now don't get me wrong,'cause I ain't going nowhere
It just breaks my heart that I can't be there for you
We've both been hurt by somebody else
But now you're mine and I won't let you go
Baby I'm ready so when you need me just call
Baby, I'm ready, I wanna give you my all
Give me your heart, babe, I'll suppress your pain
I got so much love to give, girl
I'm ready, baby, I'm ready
So when you need me, just call
Baby, I'm ready, I wanna give you my all
Give me your heart, babe, I'll suppress your pain (I'll suppress your pain)
I got so much love to give, girl (to give)
I'm ready, I'm ready
