Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woken up this morning
With a fracture on my heart
I can feel the desperation
As it tries not to fall apart
I'm sad to see the mirror
And my pictures seem to change
My smile is set on crooked
And my light is in the shade
How did you do this?
When you came it felt like rain
Fresh, pure, translucent
Tracing down my windowpane
How did you do this to me?
I woke up in the early hours
With your face behind my eyes
I've been dreaming'bout you baby
And for some time it felt so nice
But when I realize
That I'm still sat at home alone
Your side of the bed still made
And now I know that you don't
How did you do this?
When you came it felt like rain
Fresh, pure, translucent
Tracing down my window pane
How do you do this to me?
How do you do this to me?
To me, to me
How did you do this?
How did you do this?
And so my day's done
And this song is my tale
Let this be a lesson to ya everyone
Now don't you give your heart away
Oh how did you do this? How did you? How did you?
Oh where you came it fell like rain
Oh fresh pure translucent
Tracing down my window of pain
How did you do this to me, to me?
How did you do this to me, to me, to me?
How did you, how, how did you, how, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How did you, how, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
To me
