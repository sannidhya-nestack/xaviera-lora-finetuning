I can't help the way you make me feel
Never know nothing that feels so real
When you move your body to the beat
So close to me
I go crazy when you touch my skin
I get dizzy when you're creeping in
Make me smile whatever you doing
So close to me, baby
Come here baby, connect to me, connect to me
Baby
Come here baby, connect to me, connect to me
Baby
It's like the wind, it comes crashing in
Toss away and then it comes again
Hope this feeling's never gonna end
Hold on to me
I'll be there no matter where you are
I'll be gentle with your tender heart
Be the light that keeps you through the dark
Hold on to me
Baby
Come here baby, connect to me, connect to me, baby (baby)
Come here baby, connect to me, connect to me, baby
You changed my life for good, for good
Baby, you know we could feel this way forever
Baby, connect to me, connect to me
Baby, connect to me, connect to me
Connect to me, connect to me, baby
Connect to me, connect to me
Baby, maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come here, baby, connect to me, connect to me
Baby, maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come here, baby, connect to me, connect to me
No, no, no, yeah, yeah
I love the love that you give to me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (I love the love that you give to me, baby)
