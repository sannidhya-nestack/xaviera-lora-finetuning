What you gonna do on Sundays
When I'm not there to bring your tea
Who's gonna cook your breakfast if it's not me
Who's gonna take you shopping
And sit with you and watch TV
What you gonna do on Sundays without me
I know it was unexpected, never dreamed it would happen this way
But it looks like I'll be away for some time, I wish I could stay
I'm gonna think about you every day until I get home
But I can't help wondering how you'll get by
Hey, while I'm away, what you gonna do on Sundays when I'm not there to bring your tea?

It's just the simple things that keeps the love alive
And we can do it all again but we may have to wait a little while
What you gonna do on Sundays
When I'm not there to bring your tea
Who's gonna cook your breakfast if it's not me
Who's gonna take you shopping
And sit with you and watch TV
