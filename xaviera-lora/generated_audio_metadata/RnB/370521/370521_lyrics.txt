I wonder what I did wrong
I wonder what I did wrong
I wonder what I did wrong
I finally opened eyes
How did it take so long
Seeing the truth, no lies
I wonder what I did wrong
I finally opened eyes
How did it take so long
Seeing the truth, no lies
I wonder what I did wrong
I wonder what I did wrong
I wonder what I did wrong
