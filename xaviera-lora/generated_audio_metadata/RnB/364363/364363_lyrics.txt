All right, when it's time to move on, you got to sing about my song. Are you ready? (Yeah!)
All right, the hoes in the house? (Yeah!) Come on, say!
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Can't you hear my goodbye song
Adios, adios, adios, adios
Wave goodbye and let's sing it again
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Can't you hear my goodbye song
Adios, adios, adios, adios
Wave goodbye till we meet again
Bags are packed, I'm ready to go
No use hanging around here no more
Been so nice, but I can't stay
It's time for me to call it a day
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Hey, can't you hear my goodbye song?
Adios, senora, auf Wiedersehen
Wave goodbye till we meet again
I got my ticket here in my hand
I got to move as fast as I can
There's towns and cities, valleys and hills
Trains and planes and automobiles
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Can't you hear my goodbye song?
Adios, sayonara, auf Wiedersehen
Wave goodbye, let's sing it again
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Can't you hear my goodbye song
Adios, sayonara, auf Wiedersehen
Wave goodbye, till we meet again
When you got the vibe, you got to ride
Are you ready? (Yeah) Yeah!
Come on, let's do it now, are you ready? (Yeah)
Let me hear the goodbye song
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Can't you hear my goodbye song?
Ay-oh, say another "Au Revoir"
Wave goodbye, let's say it again
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Let you hear my goodbye song
Adios, sayonara, auf Wiedersehen
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye'til we meet again
Bye bye, farewell, let's say so long
Let you hear my goodbye song
Adios, sayonara, auf Wiedersehen
Say goodbye, let's sing it again
