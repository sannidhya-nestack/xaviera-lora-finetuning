Royal street, fashion queen all night
Everything southern, pure delight
Playing street music, the bands so tight
Sipping on a julepai and blues tonight
Rhythms of the south and moonlight glow
Jazz and laughter, let the good times flow
Dancing in the squares where the shadows show
Feel the heartbeat of the bayou slow
Southern nights feel so free
Music in the air come dance with me
Bayou blues on the starry skies
Pure Creole magic never dies
Landons hang low lighting up the street
Catch the rhythm feel the heat
Southern nights are never complete without the bayou blues beat
Trumpets blare and stories told
From the Bayou Bay like treasures bold
Feel the spirit and watch it unfold
New Orleans Knights they never grow old
Villains of the south in the moonlight glow
Jazz and laughter let the good times flow
Dancing in the squares where the shadows show
Feel the heartbeat of the bayou slow
Southern nights feel so free
Music in the air come dance with me
Bayou blues of the starry skies
Pure Creo magic never dies
Let the tango lighten up the street
Catch the rhythm, feel the heat
Southern nights are never complete without the Bayou Blues beat
Strong Bayou Blues beat
Strong Bayou Blues beat
