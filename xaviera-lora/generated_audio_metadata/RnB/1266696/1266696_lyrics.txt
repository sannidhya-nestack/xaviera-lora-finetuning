Been dreaming'bout you
Every single night
Seven years of waiting
Still can't get it right
A velvet never started
So far apart we stand
Never met each other
Slipping through my hands
Seven years too late
The dreams have all gone cold
You're not the same you anymore
Our story left untold
Held onto a picture of who you used to be
But time she changes everyone, now you're a mystery
Letters left unspoken, promises that broke
In the silence of the distance, we vanished like a smoke
Seven years too late
The dreams have all gone cold
You're not the same you anymore
Our story left untold
Bittersweet edge, unspoken promises that broke
In the silence of the distance, we vanished like a smoke
Seven years too late, the dreams have all gone cold
You're not the same, you anymore
Our story left untold
