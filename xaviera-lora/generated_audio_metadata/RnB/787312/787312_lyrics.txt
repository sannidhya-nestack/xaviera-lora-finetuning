Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Loving you is all I do, is all I feel
Can't get you out of my mind
Loving you is all I do, is all I feel
Can't get you out of my mind
Loving you is all I do, is all I feel
If loving you is a crime, I'll do the time (I can't get you out of my mind)
Can't get you out of my mind (I've been watching)
You're in my soul, hey
If I could say today was only a dream
If I could stay I'd pray that we could be free
Free to be real
Baby this is something real
Can't get you out of my mind, yeah yeah
Loving you is all I do, is all I feel
If loving you is a crime, I do the time
Can't get you out of my mind
You're in my soul
If you could be with me, I'd give you my soul
If you could see that we were losing it all
Just let it go, baby, this is something real
I can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
I can't get you out of my mind
Can't get you out of my mind
I love you, that's all I do, that's all I feel, can get you out of my mind (I love you, that's all I do, that’s all I feel, can get you out of my mind)
All I need is a word, a little time, can get you out of my mind (All I need is a word, a little time, can get you out of my mind)
Can get you out of my mind (Can get you out of my mind)
Loving you is all I do is all I feel (Can I get you out of my mind) (If loving you is all I do is all I feel) (Can I get you out of my mind, can I get you out of my mind, can I get you out of my mind) (Can I get you out of my mind)
I can't get you out of my mind (I can't get you out of my mind)
