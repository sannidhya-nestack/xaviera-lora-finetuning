Hey, baby
Nothing has been quite the same
Ever since I heard you breathe out my name
I never had a feeling so strong
With you isn't where I belong
Your kiss has given me the wings to
Fly too high, my feet never touch the ground
And it only takes a moment to say I love you
And it only takes a minute
'Cause every time I look into your eyes I realize
This is gonna take a lifetime to show you how much
Every time I look in your eyes
I see an innocence without disguise
I pinch myself and Lord knows I see
That heaven has given an angel to me
I'll hold your hand as you sleep tonight
And pray to hold it for the rest of my life
And it only takes a moment
To say I love you (to say I love you)
And it only takes a minute
'Cause every time I look into your eyes I realize
It's gonna take a lifetime to show you how much
This love of yours does scare me so
Ten times more than you'll ever know (you'll ever know)
And though you're too young to see
I'll always be your daddy
No matter how far you go
No matter how old I grow
And it only takes a moment to say I love you (say I love you)
And it only takes a minute to swear that it's true (that it's true)
every time I look into your eyes I realize
It'll only take a lifetime to show you how
And it only takes a moment to say I love you (to say I love you, say I love you)
And it only takes a minute to swear that it's true (oh so true)
every time I look into your eyes I realize (I realize)
It's gonna take a lifetime to show you (it's gonna take a lifetime to show)
Life's time to show you how much
To show you how much
Life's time to show you I love you
