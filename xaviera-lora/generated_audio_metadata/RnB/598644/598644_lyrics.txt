Heat waves, welters on
Night cats start their prowl
I'm doing up my hair
Can't wait to get there
'Cause I'm ready now to feel your full-on power next to me, yeah
I'm wearing black and I'm ready to see
If you can crack my little coin mystery
where I want you to be
Tonight is cozy and close to me
Shoulder straps so thin
Hair falls on my skin
Little makeup on
It's only you I want
'Cause I'm ready now to let your full on power conquer me, yeah
I'm wearing black and I'm ready to see
If you can crack my little court mystery
where I want you to be
Tonight is cozy and close to me
Jazz beat driving
Coinciding with my heart racing for you
Time is flying, swirling by
My world is down to just us two
I'm wearing black and I'm ready to see
If you can crack my little coy mystery
where I want you to be
Tonight is cozy and close to me
I'm wearing black and I'm ready to see
If you can crack my little core mystery
where I want you to be
Tonight is cozy and close to me
'Cause where I want you to be
Tonight is cozy and close to me
