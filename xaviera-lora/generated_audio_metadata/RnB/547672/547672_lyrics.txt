I can't believe it
Just yesterday we were talking
Could it be him?
Is it my imagination or could this be true?
At a distance hand in hand is it really you?
Should I believe my eyes could they be playing tricks on me?
all the words you say that's not what I see
Everything that glitters isn't always gold
Now I finally understand what I've been told
Things aren't always as we think they may sometimes appear
As the scene unfolds it's perfectly clear
And they were sweet talking, slow walking
Ocean shoving faithfully
Could they be reminiscing
Oh but something's missing
In the picture something's missing
Something's surely missing in me
Yesterday on top the world was you and I (you and I)
Now my heart is feeling funny like I'm gonna cry (gonna cry)
But I'm standing round my head as if I'm in a daze
Makes me sorry for the games I
And as I'm getting close, I'm thinking, should I bleed? (Should I bleed?)
For only seconds, yet it seems, the motion's beating
Is it fact or is it fiction? Well, to my surprise
It's another girl and another guy
And they were sweet talking, slow walking
Pushing, shoving, playfully
Could they be reminiscing?
Oh but something's missing in the picture
Something's missing
Something's surely missing in me
Why, why must we lose before we know what we have?
Hold them, tell them that you care
And do some sweet talking, slow walking
Push and shove and playfully
A little reminiscing
A lot of hug and kissing
A little sweet talking
Playfully
Sweet talking
Slow walking
A little push and shove and playfully
