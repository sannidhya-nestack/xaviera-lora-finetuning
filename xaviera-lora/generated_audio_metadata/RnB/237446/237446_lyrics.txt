I know me a sweet man live just around the block
And every time I see him my knees start to knock
And when he smiles at me my hair stand on my head
And that's when it starts when my face turn cherry red
He moves me and grooves me
My baby don't lose me
Takes me to the top
Gives me all that he's got
He moves me and grooves me
My baby don't lose me
He keeps me going until I'm screaming stop
(Shake it real hard)
From my feet up to my head (up to my head, up, up to my head)
It makes me turn cherry red
While we layin' in my bed (cherry, cherry, cherry, cherry red)
I like the way he walks when he's feelin' mad
I love the way he talks when he's being bad
I love the way he drinks he takes it straight to the head
And that's when it starts when his eyes turn cherry red
He shakes me and wakes me
My baby don't break me
Takes me to the top
Gives me all that he's got
He shakes me and wakes me
But my baby don't break me
He keeps me going until I'm screaming stop
Cherry rain from my feet up to my head (up to my head)
Say, up to my head (it makes me turn)
Cherry rain (cherry, cherry, cherry)
While we're laying in my bed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cherry rain
From my feet up to my head
It makes me turn cherry red
While we're laying in my bed (cherry, cherry, cherry red)
Now I'm just about through talking'bout my one good man
And I wanna be sure
That y'all understand (Understand, understand)
When we make love in my small squeaky bed
It turns me inside out
It makes it cherry red
It moves me, it grooves me (yeah)
My baby don't lose me (don't lose me now)
Takes me to the top (straight to the top)
Gives me all that he's got (mm, mm)
It moves me, it grooves me
My baby don't lose me (don't lose me now)
He keeps me goin' until I'm screamin' stop (and I'm screamin' stop)
Cherry red, from my feet up to my head (up to my head, up, up, up to my head)
He makes me turn cherry red (cherry red)
While we layin' in my bed
Cherry, cherry, cherry
