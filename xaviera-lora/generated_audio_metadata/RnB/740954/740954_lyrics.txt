You know I'm coming and I won't be long
I'm in a hurry
So baby come on
With a tip tap a pitter pat
Any way they go
And you know that they flow with the feeling
Away they go
A tip tap a pitter pat
Any way they go
And you know that they flow with the feeling
Away they go
Head to my toes
The music takes control
Yeah yeah yeah
Head to my toes
The music takes control
Head to my toes
The music takes control
Head to my toes
The music takes control
Movin' already, I got my dancing shoes on
Let's take it steady
The night is still young
With a tip top pitter patter
Any way they go
And you know that they flow with the feeling
Away they go
A tip top pitter patter
Any way they go
And you know that they flow with the feeling
Away they go
Head to my toes
The music takes control
Head to my toes, the music takes control
Head to my toes, the music takes control
Head to my toes, the music takes control
Music takes control, the music takes control, music takes control
Music takes control, the music takes control, music takes control
Just let the music, just let the music, just let the music take control
Just let the music, just let the music, just let the music take control
