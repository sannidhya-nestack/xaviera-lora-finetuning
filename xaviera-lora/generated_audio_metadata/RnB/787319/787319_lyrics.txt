Feeling this instinctively
I wanna tell you something baby
Feeling this instinctively
Feeling this instinctively
Feeling this instinctively
Feeling this instinctively
Forever, yeah
That's the way you love me baby
Sometimes I feel you treat me disrespectfully
My heart responds to only trust and honesty
But we've spent so long drying our wasted tears
Holding close to dreams that faded through the years
Ooh baby, you love me so distractively, yeah
I need someone to rescue me (Yes, I need someone)
In time, forever (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Baby, I'm feeling this instinctively (I'm feeling this instinctively)
I feel the need to set you free
In time, forever (oh yeah, forever)
I've tried so hard to show you my affection
But all I saw was lies and your deception
We spent so long hiding every fear
Hoping through the storm you'll always find me near
You, baby
You love me so destructively
It's the way you love me
I need someone to rescue me (In time)
Save me from insanity
Ooh baby
I'm feeling this instinctively (Feeling this instinctively) yeah
I feel the need to set you free (In time)
I wanna tell you something baby
It's the way you love me
Feeling this instinctively
Feeling this instinctively
It's the way you love me
Kinda love so bad, just day after day
But all we do is look the other way
We've spent so long denying how we feel
Holding close the dreams that never can be real
Baby, you love me so destructively
I need someone to rescue me
Don't you know how I feel?
Forever
That's the way you love me baby
I'm feeling this instinctively
