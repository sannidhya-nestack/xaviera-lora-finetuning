Havin' to keep the 38 loaded with the extra clip and the tips
With the tip by the collar clip, uh

When you get the munchies after burnin' the pot in the hood
She won't wash your drawers or fold your jeans
I .M .T., baby, so when you leave you lookin' clean, nah mean?
I got traded but you wished that I was back on your team
You said things weren't clean when you were the right one, I know
