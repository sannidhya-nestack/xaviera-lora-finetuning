Never have I seen in all these days
A man with the face of an angel
That came and took the heart of me
Like a fairy tale, oh, you were so sweet
Changed my world forever
And now I'll never be the same
This girl became a woman
And I just want to know
I loved, oh yes, I loved, oh yes, I loved you so
And I thought that you would be there
And I know you don't wanna be
But the girl that became a woman was me
So tell me how earth stopped moving
And earth hasn't seen the things that I've seen
And the Lord's blossom and smell so sweet
Created all these things just for me
This girl became a woman
And I just loved you and want to know
I loved, I loved, oh yes, I loved, I loved you so
And I thought that you would be there
Oh, I know you don't want to see
But the girl that became a woman was me
I feel like moving mountains
I know I can cross the sea
And there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing greater than being
Peer into yourself
There is nothing there
And I know you don't want to be there
Oh I know you don't want to see
But the girl that became a woman with me
She became all mine
She became me
She became me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
