You've been negative so long
You don't know how to get along
Without mentioning the bad things in the past
And baby what I'm trying to show ya
Is that when people get to know ya
Keep that attitude and baby it won't last
So turn your nose up to the blue sky
You can't change the past so don't try
Look ahead'cause there are bright days coming fast
Listen to me'cause I know child
It's so easy for me to smile
Follow the sun and just have fun with what you have
And I know you got some things wrong
And I know you're down but not for too long
If you can just focus on what you have
Not on what you don't
You gotta slow down, turn yourself around
I don't want your negativity on me
Look ahead to all the good things that tomorrow surely will bring
Think of those who don't have anyone who cares
You got a roof over your head
And when you're sleeping in your bed
Remember you've got me and I ain't going nowhere
When you need a smile just call me
You can put your troubles on me
And when you leave this earth just wait I'll meet you there
And I know it hasn't been great
And I know you're down but mama don't wait
Put a big smile up on your face
It's never too late
You gotta slow down, turn yourself around
I don't want your negativity on me
And I know it's hard for you girl
Got so much going on in your world
Listen to me cause baby I'm sure
Try to smile it works
You gotta slow down
Turn yourself around
Cause I don't want your negativity on me
Better slow down
Turn yourself around
'Cause I don't want your negativity on me
You had better turn yourself around
Slow down, slow it down, turn yourself around
I don't want your negativity on me
I don't want your negativity on me
I don't want your negativity on me
