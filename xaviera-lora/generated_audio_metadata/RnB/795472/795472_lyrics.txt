At the sunset
The boys they were placing their bets
She was a huntress
She didn't make time for regrets
When our eyes met
I knew that she was out of her brain
She was a veteran
And she knew just how to play
Soul Safari
You know I was asleep at the wheel
Soul Safari
She found her next victim and she closed the deal, yeah
Soul Safari
In high fashion
She'd go from her head to her toes
I took the bait
And then I began to propose
Do I know you?
That's what she asked as I stammered away
Another wild one on her third cabernet
Confused and distracted like never before
I just couldn't find a way out
I don't even know if I'll try anymore
I've otten what freedom's about
I embraced her
Obeying every single command
The players, they won but they just didn't understand
And she had me
Moving in the ferry next week
We were together but I was alone on a lonely street
Soul Safari
I couldn't help but see it through
Soul Safari
She found her next victim and I had no clue
Soul Safari
The boys turned out to be right
Soul Safari
She found her next victim and she owned me that night
She owned me baby
Oh, too bad it was me
Bad side of Safari
She's pulling me down, she's dragging me down
She's pulling me way, way, way down
