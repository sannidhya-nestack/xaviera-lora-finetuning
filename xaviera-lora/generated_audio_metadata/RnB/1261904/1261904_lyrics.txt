Beneath the silver of the moonlight
We found a rhythm oh so right
And your eyes are from the light
That guided me through the depths of the night
Oh honey can't you see
We're dancing in the symphony
With each beat of my heart
Each breath you take
We're creating our own destiny
Under the velvet sky
Your whispers echo a lullaby
In the corners of the night
We danced until the morning light
In the rhythm of the night
We found our hearts take flight
With your hand in mine
Oh darling everything just feels so right
In this dance there's no goodbye
Only love confessions under the midnight sky
Our souls intertwined in this dance we're forever tied
As the daylight steals our night
Our rhythm begins to fade from sight
You're like the melody of a timeless song
Our dance will echo ever so bright
Under the velvet sky
Your whispers echo a lullaby
The whispers echo a lullaby
Under the velvet corners of the night
We danced until the morning light
In the rhythm of the night
We found our hearts take flight
With your hand in mine, oh darling
Everything just feels so right
In this dance there's no goodbye
Only love confessions under the midnight sky
Our souls intertwined in this dance we're forever tied
