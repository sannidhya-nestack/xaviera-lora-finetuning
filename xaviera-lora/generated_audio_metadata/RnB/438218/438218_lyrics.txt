You closed the book, you shut it down
Can't find a way to work it round
And all that's left, this empty space
I find no words, I fall from grace
But all this time
You stared at your shoes and held your tongue
So what went wrong?
A stranger to my eyes
Leaving, leaving me out in the cold
Believe what you want, you're still leaving
I can't believe what you've done
Believe what you want, you're still leaving
Leaving me out in the cold
Believe what you want, you're still leaving
I can't believe what you've done
Believe what you want, you're still gone
I don't quite get just what you do
And why all this is down to you
I'm not so sure what I'm supposed to do
So when you're gone, I guess I'll work it through
And all this time
I never believed it would come to this
And there you stand
A stranger to my eyes
Leaving, leaving me out in the cold
Believe what you want, you're still leaving
I can't believe what you've done
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (oh this time)
Leaving me out in the cold (you stayed up too short)
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (to what went wrong)
I can't believe what you've done (a stranger to my heart)
Believe what you want, you're still gone
Leaving (leaving)
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (I can't believe what you've done) (I can't believe what you've done)
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (woo-woo)
Leaving me out in the cold
Believe what you want, you're still leaving
I can't believe what you've done
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (all this time)
Leaving me out in the cold (you said it to me)
Believe what you want, you're still leaving (to what went wrong)
I can't believe what you've done
Believe what you want you're still gone
Believe what you want you're still gone
Believe what you want you're still gone
Believe what you want you're still gone
