Yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
I've been thinking this all along
We turning to strangers, it's been a while
Don't even talk, we still don't know who was wrong
Don't know who to blame, at the end of the day
Make up your mind, what are we fighting for
You run away, but baby I can't wait
Cause it hurts to know that I'm why you're gone
Or is it the other way, do you feel the same
What's in the way of us becoming everything
We wanted for the longest
And it sucks just because I never thought that it would get here
Nothing ever hurt as bad as this did
Let's put in some effort to fix it
Cause this isn't something that we should just dismiss
Now all I can think is
Damn I miss the old us
It's probably shit I should've said right after we broke up
Both of us are mad and I don't even think that we're sure
What the problem is or exactly how we got to this point
Baby it's long overdue
We put in time why can't we fight through
I can't do it alone, I need your help if I'ma tell the truth
Let's stop being petty'cause now I think I'm ready for you, you
Damn, I miss the old us
There's probably shit I should've said to you after we broke up
Both of us are mad and I don't even think that we're sure
What the problem is or exactly how we got to this point
Baby it's long overdue
