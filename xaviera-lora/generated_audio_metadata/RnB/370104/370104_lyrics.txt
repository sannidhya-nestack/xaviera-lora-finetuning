Have you ever had an itch you just can't scratch
Or an aching fever you know you're gonna catch
Now this is caused by love deprivation
So I found someone who's a medical sensation
Dr. Good Stuff got a remedy
He got something feels real good to me
Don't use powders, pills are pharmacy
Dr. Good Stuff I got everything I need
When I need lovin' he makes a house call
His love injection really keeps me on the ball
I don't need pills to cure this sick inside
No ambulance to take me for a ride
Dr. Good Stuff got a remedy
He got something feels real good to me
Don't use powders, pills are pharmacy
Dr. Good Stuff got everything I need
Late at night if I feel a little rough
I call the doctor to come round
And do his stuff
Now this is caused by love deprivation
So I found someone who's a medical sensation
Like the good stuff got a remedy
We got something feels real good to me
Don't use powders, pills are pharmacy
Got the good stuff
Got everything I need
Got the good stuff
Got a remedy
He got something
Feels real good to me
Don't use powders
Feels like pharmacy
Got the good stuff
Got everything I need
Got the good stuff
That's the good stuff
That's the good stuff
That's the good stuff
That's the good stuff
