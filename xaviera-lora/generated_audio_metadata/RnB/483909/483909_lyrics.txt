I've done nothing to make you sorry
I've done nothing to make you mad
Why are you always in a hurry?
'Cause I feel so sad
And I wonder what I have to say
I'm here all by myself
I want you all for me
In this state, in this age
Oh honey, can't you see?
I want you all myself
I want you all for me
I want you all so bad
Today on you I see
You've got no way, not again
I know it's hard to believe
But every time you think again
Can you see what I've seen
Can you feel the way I've been, oh
I miss you so my love
I want you all for me
And if you come again
You'll find out what I mean
I want you for myself
I want you all for me
And if I can't have you
Oh I will never be
I mean all by myself, I want you all for me
In these days, in these days, oh honey can't you see
I want you for myself, I want you all for me
I want you oh so bad, today on you I see
I'm evil by myself, I want you all for me
In this day, in this age, oh honey can't you see?
I want you for myself, I want you all for me
I want you all so bad, today on you I see
