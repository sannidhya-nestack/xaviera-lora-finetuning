I always knew
That I've been in love with you
Sure as the rain does fall or the sun does shine
Through the window down the hall
I always knew
That I could always count on you
Whenever I call your name in the night or day
You would be there just the same
And I always thought I'd see you one more time
But I never thought we'd never say goodbye
I always knew I'd spend every night with you
Even if you weren't there I'd climb the stair
Close my eyes and find you there
I knew each time that you walked in through the door
You'd have a story to tell about heaven or hell
Or two tickets to the show
And I always thought I'd see you one more time
But I never thought we'd never say goodbye
They say that memories don't fade away (don't fade away)
They just linger on and on (linger on)
Like a fire burning in my heart
It's tearing me apart
Tearing me apart
And I always thought I'd see you one more time
But I never thought we'd never say goodbye
I never thought we'd never say goodbye
