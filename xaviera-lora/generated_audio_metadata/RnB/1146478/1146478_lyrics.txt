Wow, wow, I need you in my life
Thinking about you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Wow, wow, everything you should say
You ain't even gotta ask me, babe (you ain't gotta ask me, no)
I just need to know the time and the place (yeah)
You know I got it, I need it (oh)
Let me give you this feeling
All your scars, yeah, I'm healing
So just know (you know) I'm ten toes down for ya (okay)
So you already know what I came for
I've been on you for a while now (I've been on you)
And I just wanted you to know, you to know
That I've been feeding for ya
Love in the open sky
You see the love bleeding down my eyes
And I just wanted you to know, you to know
That I've been feeling for ya (loving you)
Love in the open sky
You see the love being down my eyes
And I need you to come home
Come home to me
To me
To me
I've been feeling for ya
Lovin' you
I need you to come home, baby, come home
I'm'bout to spend the bag on you
Put you in a fast car, too
Louis V bag for you
I'm'bout to spend this cash on you
Cartier jewels, baby are you coming through?
I just wanted you to know, you to know
That I've been feeding for ya
Love in the open sky
You see the love bleeding down my eyes
And I just wanted you to know, you to know
That I've been feeding for ya
Love in the open sky
You see the love bleeding down my eyes
And I need you to come home, come home to me
To me, to me
Cause I'm feeling for you (loving you, loving you)
Sky, you see the love bleeding down my eyes
And I want you to come home, come home to me
