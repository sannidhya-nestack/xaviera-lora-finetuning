I don't know why I even try
When you don't even care about me
I know I'm a fool
But what can I do
Cause David I'm crazy about you
I do what I can to be your man
But you just turned your back on me
For heaven's sake, give me a break Baby, I'm just crazy about you
I've been around, I know that's true
Before I set my eyes on you
But since that day, there ain't no way
Anyone else will do
So please take this heart
But don't tear it apart
I'll do anything you want me to
I know I'm a fool
But what can I do?
Baby, I'm just crazy about you
I've been around, I know that's true
Before I set my eyes on you
But since that day, there ain't no way
Anyone else will do
So please take this heart
But don't tear it apart
I'll do anything you want me to
I know I'm a fool
But what can I do?
Baby I'm just crazy about you
I'll do anything you want me to do
Baby I'm just crazy about you
