You know my time
Big break to know you
You're way set
And I'm the best
But did you mean it?
Come face to face
Don't say bye, moonlit
Say yes to this offense
No more sense of sinking today
And I need some rest
Won't take no second best
Too much for me, it's impossible
So love me'til you die
Got to be the one
With time to think
The suit fits to what you send out
Just what the meaning is
Well who's to say
No shit, I'm lonely
I guess you're missing
In all my sense of living today
I need some rest
Won't take no second best
Too much for me is impossible
So love me'til you die
And I have lived too long
To crave for better days
I have missed the love
