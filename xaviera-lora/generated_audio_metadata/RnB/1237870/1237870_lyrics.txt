I'll do the heavy lifting for you
Felt the weight when the skies ain't blue
I'll do the heavy lifting for you
When the world's too much I'll pull us through
Stay strong my love
Lean on these arms
We'll rise above
When the tears fall down, let them fall on me
I'm your shelter and your heart I've got to keep
Hold on tight, I won't let you drip
In this storm of life, I'm your steady lift
I'll do the heavy lifting for you
Race against the storms, we'll both walk through
How do they help me lifting for you?
Race against the slumps we'll both walk through
Watch the burdens fade in my arms they're small
Together we stand together we'll never fall
Grit and grace, with love we'll ride our fate
I'm here unwavering, your unyielding weight
I'm the heavy lifting for you (for you)
In the darkness I'm your steadfast crew
I have it lifted for you (for you)
In the darkness, I'm your steadfast crew
When the world's cold and your spirit's sinking low
I'll be the fire, the one to make you glow
Life can crush, but it won't crush your soul
I won't let go, on me you can always hold
Through the highs and lows, our bond will never shift
With every challenge, I'll give you that extra lift
If our minds are to the heavens, yeah
