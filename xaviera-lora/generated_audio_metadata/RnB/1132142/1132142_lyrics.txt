Or when you're by my side nothing can kill this vibe
When there's fire next to me, oh
The lights are low
But I can see your energy it starts to glow
Baby'cause our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Baby'cause our vibe is so strong
Like we could go and now there's something in the air
Sparkles everywhere
The lights are low
But I can see your energy
It starts to glow
Baby,'cause our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
My vibe is so strong
My vibe is so strong
My vibe is so strong
Baby,'cause my vibe is so strong
My vibe is so strong
My vibe is so strong
Vibes so strong, our vibe is so strong
Our vibe is so strong
Baby, oh
Baby, oh
