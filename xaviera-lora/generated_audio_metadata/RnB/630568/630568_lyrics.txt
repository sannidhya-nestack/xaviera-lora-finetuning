Mmm, yeah, yeah, ain't nothin' changed
Oh, ain't nothin' changed
I said, ain't nothin' changed
Here's the deal, I got one shot
To make it worth, that's all I got
To get this money in my hand
That's for real, that's the plan
When I walk, brothers gon' follow
At my head, they point that hollow
At my back, they say the knife
For the time, the feeling's right
Still I gotta march on like a soldier
I don't see no end in sight
Waiting for the struggle to be over
Every day's another fight in the street they call me the boss
I am the captain that make things happen
But I always watch my back
I can't sleep, I can't relax,'cause ain't nothin' changed (I'm a hustler)
People you see, be on the sneak, ain't nothin' changed (See, I'm a hustler)
Streets are mean and the drugs ain't cheap, ain't nothin' changed (I'm a hustlar)
Loyalty sometimes run deep, but you gotta move, get in the groove
Do what you got to, get what you got to
I see my homie from around the way (what's up homie)
Back in the hood (hey what's good) back in the day
On the block we'd roll the dice
Check the honeys but watch the vice
Creeping around in the neighborhood (suspects in the area)
Talking trash never up to no good
Trying to get my homie to roll on me
Don't step to me if you know what's good
I don't know just what was said or how my homie ended up dead
But now that target is on my back still got that hollow pointed at my head
Ain't no love out there for me I can't trust nobody in the street
I gotta always watch my back
I can't sleep, I can't relax, no (cause ain't nothin' changed)
I'm a hustler
PPC, be on the sneak, yeah (ain't nothin' changed)
See, I'm a hustler
The streets are mean and the drugs ain't cheap (no)
Ain't nothin' changed (I'm a hustler)
And loyalty sometimes runs deep, yeah
But you gotta move, get in the groove
Do what you got to, get what you got to
I'm a hustler baby
But sometimes I do things I don't like
See I be hustling baby
Every day in the street
Day and night you see
See I be hustling baby
I don't really wanna do nothing wrong
Sometimes I wish I could just run away
Wish I didn't have to sing this song
ain't nothing changed
Well, but baby you see it be on the sneak yeah
Ain't nothing changed
(See I'm a hustler)
Beats are mean and the drugs ain't cheap (no)
Ain't nothing changed (I'm a hustler)
Loyalty sometimes run deep
But you gotta move, get in the groove (well)
Do what you gotta do, get what you gotta do (well)
See I'm a hustler, baby
Ain't nothing changed
