I told you wait for me
But you said I've got to be free
I asked and begged and pleaded
I beg you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I told you wait for me
But you said I've got to be free
I asked and begged and pleaded
I begged you
I told you wait for me
But you said, I've got to be free
I asked and begged and pleaded
I begged you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh ,oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
