You think the world revolves around
Those perfect shoes that you've laid on the ground
But boy you better think again if you're expecting me to bow
I hate to say it but it's time you figured out
Well, what you got is not a lot, you gotta let it go
You oughta know, you oughta know that you're ettable
When they ask me who you are, I will not say a thing
Because I won't even remember
I won't even remember
Yeah, you step to me and try to claim
Like I had nothing else before you came
No matter who you think you are
And what I lack is made you vain
I hate to say it but you need to work on your game
Cause, well what you got is not a lot
You ought to let it go
You ought to know, you ought to know
That you're ettable
When they ask me who you are
I will not say a thing because I won't even remember
Pride, go with me for the fall, for all
And if that don't sink in, well at least I'll catch it again
Ziyutiyutiyutute yiziyutiyutiyutute
well what you got is not a lot
You oughta let it go
You oughta know, you oughta know
That you're ettable
When they ask me who you are
I will not say a thing
I won't know, I won't, I won't know
When they ask me who you are
I will not say a thing
I won't know
You are close, you are enough that you'll et and fall
When they ask me who you are
I will not say a thing because I won't even remember
