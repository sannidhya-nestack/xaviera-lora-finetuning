Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What about the girl that don't glitter in your love night?
Living in this world built on black versus white
What about the girl who cried alone at night?
Because this world put up one hell of a fight
But enough already
Get away and let me free
I'm D-O-N-E-N-G-O-N-E
I'm at the limit, I am so finished
Leave me alone
I'm D-O-N-E-N-G-O-N-E
Will not tolerate, or try to navigate
Leave me alone
Nobody listens, except to their own egos
It always happens yet again
Here we go
Everyone is blind
Zip the clouds of snow
Open your mind
Cast a new vote
Getting us all dirty
Guess you're just not ready
I gotta go
I'm D-O-N-E-N-G-O-N-E
I'm at the limit, I am so finished
Leave me alone
I'm D-O-N-E-NG-O-N-E
Will not tolerate, try to navigate
Leave me alone
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so
D-O-N-E-N-G-O-N-E
I'm at the limit (ay)
I am so finished (ay)
Leave me alone (oh)
I'm from D-O-N-E-N-G-O-N-E
Will not tolerate (oh)
Try and never get (yeah)
Leave me alone (oh)
It's hard to be you
M-B-I'm D-O-N-E
I'm at the end of it, I'm at the finish
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
D-O-N-E-R-G-O-N-E
Will not tolerate, shall not regret
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
