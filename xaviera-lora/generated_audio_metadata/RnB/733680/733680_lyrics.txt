Cause I wanna fly
I'm gonna leave the ground where I'm standing
'Cause I know nothing stays the same and everything is always changing (changing, changing, changing, changing)
So I can't stay in this one place very long and I'll go
As far as I need to go to make me feel better
I don't care whatever
Bring it on windy weather
I wanna fly
I'm gonna leave the ground where I am standing
I don't ever intend on landing
I'll fly
I throw my hands up and let the wind take me
Gonna elevate and feel so free
I don't know how I got here
It's a strange particular position I'm in
Peculiar (peculiar)
Predicament (predicament)
Oh last time I checked
Everyone that I know was too
Heavy to unload, oh
Unable to float, oh
I wanna float
I wanna float
The ground where I am standing (where I am standing)
I don't ever intend on landing (I don't ever intend on landing)
I'm gonna love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I'll throw my hands up (I'll throw my hands up)
And let the wind take me
Gonna elevate and feel so free
I feel free to go anywhere I want to be
I wanna see you come with me
Can't you believe like I do
That we have got the best of both worlds
'Cause I wanna fly
I'm gonna leave the ground where I am standing
I don't ever intend on landing, I'll fly
I'm gonna put my hands up and then fly
I bet it feels so hungry now
