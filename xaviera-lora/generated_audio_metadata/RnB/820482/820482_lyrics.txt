Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-day
I have a secret come close
Don't you leak it and I'll share with you what's on my mind
Can you keep it inside, I and you
You got a funny way of setting your sights
And a clumsy way of walking'cause it's not always fun
Getting it done and I love you and that's my way
And all I wanna say is there's a method to my madness
And if you feel it, I gotta have it
There's a method to my madness
If you feel it, gotta have it, gotta have it
Show me the money, test me if you dare

There's a method to my madness if you feel it
There's a method to my madness (If you feel it, gotta have it)
There's a method to my madness (Yeah, yeah, if you feel it, gotta have it)
There's a method to my madness (Ooh, yeah, if you feel it, gotta have it)
There's a method to my madness (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh (There's a method to my madness)
There's a method to my, to my madness and I (There's a method to my madness)
Please don't tell me though (There's a method to my madness)
