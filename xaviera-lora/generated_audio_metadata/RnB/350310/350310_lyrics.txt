You got some gas money baby
She don't want that piece of junk you in
It ain't class enough
No Ford, no Chrysler, no Dodge, no Plymouth
She don't want no Pinto Jack
She just wants to ride in a Cadillac
This woman doesn't like your style
Better put that Ford in a jump out
Aw come on you gotta ride with me now baby
She don't want no pinto jack
She just wants to ride in a Cadillac
This woman doesn't like your style
Better put that thought in a jump pot
Ford, a Chrysler, a Dodge, a Plymouth
I don't think so, you know what she wants
She don't want no Pinto Jack
She just wants to ride in a Cadillac
This woman doesn't like your style
Better put that Ford in a jump-out
Ah, come on, you gotta rap
She don't want no pinto jack
She just wants to ride in a Cadillac
This woman doesn't like your style
Better put that Ford in a jump-out
