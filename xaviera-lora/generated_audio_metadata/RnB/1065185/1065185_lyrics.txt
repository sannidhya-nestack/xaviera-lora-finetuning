Oh, can't you see that look in my eye
We're running out of time (running out of time)
Can't you hear it when I talk to you
There's something going on inside
I don't know what I've got to do
I don't know what I got to say
I don't know what I got to do to prove
That it can't go on this way
When it's over
I said it one minute it's over
When it's over
I said it one minute it's over
You keep ignoring the signs that you see
Don't you care are you just blind?
I've given up trying to talk to you
You think that we're just fine
I've given up there's nothing to do
I've given up there's nothing to say
I've given up there's nothing to prove
It's time to walk away
When it's over
I said it, I meant it, it's over
When it's over
I said it, I meant it, over
I've given up, there's nothing to do
I've given up, there's nothing to say
I've given up, there's nothing to prove
It's time to walk away
Well it's over
I said it, I meant it, it's over
Well it's over
I said it, I meant it, it's over, when it's over
I said it, I meant it, it's over, when it's over
I said it, I meant it, it's Over
