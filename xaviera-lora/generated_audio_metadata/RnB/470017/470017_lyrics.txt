Mmm, yeah
Ooh, listen
Girl, it's time for me to stop talking to myself
I'm saying too much and I'm losing my mind
And that's bad for my health
I spend too much time, baby, for me to end up hurt
This I don't deserve, especially when I'm right there next to you, girl
Right next to you
And this house is not a home
When I feel as though I'm alone right next to you
What's causing you to act this way after all that we've been through
And all the pain just leaves me saying I still wanna be with you
There's a reason that I'm on bending knees I believe in prayer
So don't isolate my heart baby just leave me there
Right there next to you girl
Right next to you girl
And this house is not a home
When I'm feeling so alone
Right next to you
Girl, even when it's 90 degrees outside
The sun is out and the breeze is right
Why do I freeze inside?
Girl, I ain't even right
Gotta check myself in the mirror
Just to make sure that I'm still alive
when you ain't by my side
I ain't breathing right (I feel next to you)
Girl, I ain't even right
Right next to you, girl
And this house is not a home
When I'm feeling so alone
Right next to you, girl
Right there next to you, girl
Right next to you, girl
And this house is not a home
We're not feeling so alone
Right next to you girl
Right there next to you girl
Right next to you girl
And this house is not a home
We're not feeling so alone
Right next to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
