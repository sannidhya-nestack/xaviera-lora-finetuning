Back to the basics
Back to the basics
You making faces
Like we exchanging faces
We're changing places
We're changing places
It's like breakfast and bed
While we're both simultaneously fed
And the only thing she says
You gotta hold me down
Love in the air with the chronic
Legs in the air I'm excited
Gotta slow down I know you're excited
Only round one don't wanna get ignited
We making love in the middle of the morning
We get it going anytime she want it (no I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull her
Tryna pull her legs down (ooh)
We making love to the mirror in the morning
We get it going and it's how she want it (how I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull hair (ooh)
Tryna pull her legs down (ooh)
Back to the basics
Sex on a basis
You making faces
When I fill up them spaces
We changing places
Do it in different locations
World plan you making me chase it
No chaser not a drop of her wasted
And all she can say is
You gotta hold me down
Fill the oasis
I'll take you there
Back to the basics
Back to the base head
We making love in the middle of the morning
We get it going anytime she want it (I, I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull her
Tryna put her legs down (ooh)
We making love to the mirror in the morning
We get it going and it's how she want it (I, I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull her (ooh)
Tryna put her legs down
Back to the, back to the basics, basics
Sex on a, sex on a basis, basis
Come on baby turn up
Come on baby turn up
It's just a, it's just amazing
We making love in the middle of the morning
We get it going and it's how she want it (I, I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull her (ooh)
Tryna put her legs down (ooh)
We making love to the mirror in the morning
We get it going and it's how she want it (I, I want you)
She keep it going however I want it
Oh she love it when I pull hair (ooh)
Tell her put her legs there (ooh)
