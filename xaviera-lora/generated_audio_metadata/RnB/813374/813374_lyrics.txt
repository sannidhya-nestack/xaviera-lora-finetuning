I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
Baby what went wrong?
The sun comes up, I wake up and you're gone
You left me all alone
So long
I'm not running around
Running around to chase you down
Baby I'm not done
Play around and leave me in the night
Just tell me is that right
Oh no
Are you having fun?
Bring me down, you're playing with my heart
You've done it from the start, I know
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
There's something I ain't seeing
I don't know how I'm feeling but I know
I'm not running around
So baby are we done?
You pick me up and show me to your door
Your clothes still on the floor
I'll go
I'm not running around
Running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
I'm not running around, running around to chase you down
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
