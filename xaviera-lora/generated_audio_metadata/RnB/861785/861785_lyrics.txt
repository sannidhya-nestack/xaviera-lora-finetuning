Let's just run it
Now we just getting started
We coming through so make way
Started at the bottom, uh
Now we up in the race
And I got this feeling that we're not ready
It's just something crazy I am crazy, yeah yeah
Making love and all the wrong ways
Baby we been waiting, baby we been waiting (It's about that time)
Baby we been waiting
Family all around everyone is celebrating
This is everything we've earned
All those nights you put in work
Many years of overtime and getting no return
But still I fought to get mine
Made my way from out to the inside
People told me no one left and that was for the get right
Mama look I made it pops I told you we gon' get by
Taking off in 5 4 3 2 1 baby you sit tight
Having conversations'bout the dream
If I remember right it was summer 2003 at the stop light
Cruising in my CJ7 Jeep
Rolling up a b***'cause that's the Cuban in me
She knows that I like it tight so
That is how she rolls it
Tux it with her tongue she only f***ing with the potent
Baby light it up, light it up let's get to blowing
Acting like a pro'cause she on it
Uh, now we just getting started
We coming through so make way
Started at the bottom
Uh, now we up in the race
And I got this feeling that we're not
Famous, doing something crazy, acting crazy for you
Making love out of the wrong way
All I ever wanted was my family to be set
Couple blue nose pits chillin' by the fence
Oh, restricting lifestyle, baby, that's a bet
No one on this planet could tell me what I can't guess so
So I put my mind to this shit
Literally gotta put my fuckin' mind in this shit
That's how I take control
I'll be damned if I end up broke
Money isn't everything, but when I land they gon' fuckin' know
I was raised to lead the pack, so I'll lead the pack
Told myself I'll be just that, so I'll be just that
Doesn't matter what it is, if you want it bad, you will make what you had
Pickin' pieces up from scratch from the ground up
Twenty three years later'bout to mount up
Made it through some battles baby now they'bout to crown us
I told you by any means we were bound
They'll be lookin' down on these haters'cause they doubtin' me
Baby let's talk and smoke through the night
Tell me what you about, what you like
Now put the overtime in when I'm gone flying overnight
Yeah and when I'm gone I hope you think of me
That crazy love do I have to mention it physically
I know she likes it when I'm firm and gets her into me
We taking off till infinity
Uh, yeah, and we laugh, living so fast
But never et the pause for the codex
Ooh, holding hands with a slow dance
And we could take it back like a slow jam
Uh, yeah, and we could take it back like a slow jam
We could take it back like a slow jam
We could take it back like a slow jam
Yeah, mm, we could take it back like a slow jam
We could take it back like a slow jam
You take it back, slow pace
