Baby, I know
I've got to earn your love
And baby, I know
Got to earn your love each and every day
Well, I know
That you're my father taking
Baby I know
That you give your love so open heartedly
Pardon me for asking
I didn't mean to pry
Are you an angel?
Did you leave your wings above?
And did you come down here
To give me hope and lift me up?
Well I know
That you're my father taking
And baby I know
That you give your love so open heartedly
Now pardon me for asking
Are you just dreaming?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Baby I know
I've got to earn your love
Baby I know
I've got to earn your love each and every day
Well I know
That you're mine for the taking
And baby I know
That you give your love so open heartedly
Pardon me for asking
I didn't mean to pry
Pardon me for asking
Are you just a dream?
Pardon me for asking
I didn't mean pride
Pardon me for asking
I didn't mean to pry
Life just looks so beautiful to me
