All my life I've seen so many dreams left undone
There's a road ahead where my hope can carry on
One last chance I take to fix all that has gone wrong
Never mind the crowd, they'll just sing the judgement song
Keep it on this way
There's a price I'll pay
I've just lost my way
I was led astray
But I won't leave me
Searching for a place
Where I can be free, yeah
Feeling out of time, the years have flown and now I see
No faith to hold, this time it's only up to me
And I'm taking chances that I know will lead the way
I don't know if I'm right, but I'm sure that I can stay
No, no, no, no, no
Can't stay
One last chance to stay (I'm only me)
I'll be on my way
Though I try to stay
Baby I was led astray
But I'm only me
Searching for a place
Where I can be free
Keeping on, I'm only me
There's a price I'll pay
I've just lost my way
Maybe I'll let us trade
But I won't leave me
Searching for a place
I can't be free, yeah
One last chance to stay
I'm on my way
I'll be on my way
Tryna be free, yeah
Though I try to stay
Just let me be
I will set us free
But I've only been searching for a place where I can be free
