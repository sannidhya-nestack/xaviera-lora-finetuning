Is it true that you wanna be free, baby? I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby (I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby)
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby And I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
I don't know if you heard me
But what we've got is issues that need
Need to talk about it, talk about it
Now you know that you got a dime
Maybe you should take the time
To be with me and see what's going on (see what's going on)
When I turn it on and my mode is on (when I'm coming strong)
Ooh, baby, baby, you've been gone for just a little too long
And I got needs, you see
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby?
I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby
I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby?
I've been thinking'bout you and me, baby
Is it true that you wanna be free, baby?
I've been thinking'bout you and me
Now you told me that we would be together and so happy
But it wasn't true (wasn't true, wasn't true)
I think it's time to make up my mind
And let you know why I ain't feeling right
Well it goes like this and this is
Just the way it's been so listen
Hangin' on, hangin' on, hangin' on
Ooh, yeah (hangin' on for far too long, baby, ooh, yeah)
So I gotta turn it on, gotta turn it out when I'm comin' strong (oh, oh, oh)
You been gone for just a little too long and I got needs (I got needs), you see
Is it true that you wanna be free baby
I've been thinking about you and me baby
Is it true that you wanna be free baby
I've been thinking about you and me baby
Is it true that you wanna be free baby
I've been thinking about you and me baby
Is it true that you wanna be free baby
I've been thinking about you and me baby
I want to be free, set me free
I've got to be free
It's the right day for you and me (got to be free)
We should be free
I think it's time to make up my mind
And let you know why I ain't feeling right
Well it goes like this and this is
Just the way it's been so listed
So when I turn it on and my mode is on
When I'm coming strong (ooh baby baby)
You've been gone for just a little too long
And I got knees (crown)
You see, yeah it's true that I wanna be free baby
