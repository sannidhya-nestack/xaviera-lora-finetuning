Bye bye, da-bam
Bye bye, da
Bye bye, da-bam
Bye bye
Pretend that you knew
Pretend that you have just arrived
First times are the sweetest
And I'll show you right
The fallen angels soar
In through downtown and out
And all around again
I feel like at home
Let me show you the way
And I'll share my dreams with you
Follow ground, realize
Until you see my heart that's open
All night waiting for you
So let's get lost together
Let's show up at the other side
Out of the blue
Ba ba da ba
Ba ba da
Bye-bye, da-bam
Bye-bye
I guess if you can't think of a better place to be
Better place to be
That's'cause you have found yourself in the streets
In the streets
I bet you're hanging out a bit
You're hanging out a bit
You don't look like you're slowing down to me
But you're walking, walking your dream
Walking your dream
Walking your dream
Walking your dream
Walk in your dreams
You may feel you're lost
But you better think that twice
But you better think that twice
You're in the center of somewhere
And you're just quite alright
Follow ground, realize
Until you see my heart that's open
All night waiting for you
So let's get lost together
Let's show up at the other side
Out of the blue
I guess if you can't think of a better place to be (a better place to be)
That's'cause you have found yourself in the streets (in the streets)
I bet you're hanging out a bit (you're hanging out a bit)
You don't look like you're slowing down to me
But you're walking, walking your dream
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
Your life is here
Walk in your dream
