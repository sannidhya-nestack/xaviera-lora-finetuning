Master you, master you
Master you, master you
Hunkers
And that dress is looking right
The way she stands
And them three inch heels
Have a game time
The way she sips and stirs her drink
Slowly making it last
Makes me want to buy this girl more dreams
Wish I was her class
You're so amazing
Girl you're so amazing
Way down to where you're at
I just gotta get next to you'cause you're my one and only
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I make a move, I will lose
I just wanna be next to you
She's your type, step to her
Although she's with her girls
She looks like the type of girl
I'd want in my world
Should I ask for a dance?
Will she say yes or would it be too far-fetched to even take a chance?
You're so amazing
Girl I wish you could see (what you want)
The things you're doing to me (when you want them)
I just gotta get next to you (yeah)
you're a force to be trained (force to be trained me)
If I need to make'em look my way (the closer I get to you babe)
I just wanna be next to you (yeah)
I just gotta get next to you so I don't fall asleep (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You should be happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna get next to you and strangle me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Second thoughts are not my style (I don't like ya)
The kind that you take home to mama (Be my lady)
I'm gonna stay after you'cause girl, I want you (Just stay with me, baby)
Yeah (And I don't care if the way you talk, the way you move)
I just gotta get next to you (I just wanna be next to you, next to you)
If I had to make a move I would lose you (I just wanna be next to you)
Can I, can I touch your hand (oh yeah, oh yeah) while we dance (the way you walk) on the floor (the way you walk)
I just gotta get my hands on you (I know I need you more and more and more and more and more)
If I'm waiting to make a move I will lose you
I just wanna be next to you
And all I talk is my look into your pretty brown eyes
I just wanna be next to you
I just wanna get next to you
Baby you, I'm next to you yeah (I just wanna be next to you)
I just wanna be next to you
