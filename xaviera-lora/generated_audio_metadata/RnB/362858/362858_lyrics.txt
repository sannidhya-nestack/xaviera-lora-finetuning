Hey baby, you know that it's over'cause you didn't come through
You didn't come through
You gave me nothing but false promises
So I'm getting rid of you, that's what I gotta do
You said you would
If I said I could
Oh baby but you didn't come through
So how can you lie and cheat on me
And expect me to be with you
You made a promise you would take care of me
You wouldn't mess around
You'll be faithful to me
And I told you if you do I'm your boo
I will always be true
But what did you do
Oh you said (you said) you said (you would) you said you would
If I said, if I said, if I said I could
Oh baby but you didn't come through
So how can you lie and cheat on me
And expect me to be with you
Now I know you're a liar cause you cheated on me
And you thought that I never would know
I'm giving you up I can't trust in you
So it's best that I let you go
You tryna play me a fool
You know you broke every sacred rule
I put my trust in you
But what did you do? (you said)
You said you would
If I said, if I said, if I said I could, yeah
Oh baby but you didn't come through, through
So how can you lie and cheat on me and expect me to be with you
You said, you said, you said, you said you would
If I said, if I said, if I said I could
Oh, but you didn't come through, come through
So how can you lie and cheat on me and expect me to be with you?
You didn't come through
When you said you would love me
You didn't come through
And that together we would live faithfully
You didn't come through
When you said you would never lie nor cheat (you didn't come through)
And that we would make a beautiful family (you didn't come through)
When you said you would be the kind of man I could count on (you didn't come through)
Oh, but you hung in the streets and wouldn't even come home (you didn't come through)
You didn't come through (you didn't come through) You didn't come through
You didn't come through (you didn't come through) what you said you would do (oh no, no)
Hey baby, you know that it's over'cause you didn't come through, you didn't come through
You gave me nothing but false promises so I'm getting rid of you, that's what I gotta do
