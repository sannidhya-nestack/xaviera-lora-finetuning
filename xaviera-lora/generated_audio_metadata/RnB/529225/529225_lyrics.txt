Foster I'm a one way street, street signs says go away
Little boys have a little game so you better run along and play
Holla all you want and I won't ever holla back
Standing on the corner looking so tough does your mama know you talk like that
Does your mama know? Does your mama know?
Does your mama know you talk like that?
Does your mama know? Does your mama know?
Does your mama know you talk like that?
Hat, hat, busta, why you hang around?
Why, why you waste your day?
You want something when you ain't got nothing
Find a job and go get paid
Does your mama know?
Does your mama know?
Does your mama know you talk like that?
Does your mama know?
Does your mama know?
Does your mama know you talk like that? Talk like that
Hey Buster, why you hanging around?
I think you better get a job and stop playing your games
Standing on the corner looking oh so tough
You want something when you ain't got nothing
Holla all you want, that's right
I said, "Holla all you want"
Does your mama know you got a mouth like that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Does your mama know
Does your mama know
Does your mama know you talk like that?

Does your mama know you talk like that?
