When I get home in the evening
I'm a muscle no head
Funny how some gotta work so hard
For their daily bread
They say it's
Three piece suits and cowboy boots
And your ability to fight
But me that's not how I do it
And it'll be alright
I go high, high
I go high
High as a kite
Frank is fond of philosophy
Mae adores her maths
Music's everything to Marie and
Lenny makes us laugh
We're gonna
Gather all around the table
There's food and drink in life
And if the neighbors are able
They may bring a little wine
We'll go high, high
We'll go high, high as a kite
I go high, high
I go high, high as a kite
She won't subscribe to their TV lies
Read between the lines
What is right in this world tonight
Is not what sells or buys
We used to trade a lot of heartfelt notions
Left and right
You could ponder up any kind of potion
As long as it was light
We'd go high
High, we go high
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite
High as a kite now, yeah (High as a kite)
High as a kite (High as a kite)
High as a kite (Kite)
