Been around the block a number of times
Never knew which one to call on mine
Such a long time of suffering and pain
Always met the ones that were playin' the games
Now I've met you girl and I'm feelin' so high
I look at the world and I stare at the sky
It's always more fun when you're by my side
I'm never gonna go and let my life slide, baby
You are my girl, trouble girl
In a troubled world, heart so worn, world so torn
How you came to me in such harmony
And I'll never let you down, babe
It's been years since we met and I'm feeling so fine
Thought I'd never ever have a love that was mine
We've been through tragedy, joy and pain
But we always make it through without losing our way
Life isn't easy, we laugh and we cry
I look to our love to see through the light
Now when I'm alone and feeling blue
That's the time I want to spend with you, baby
You are my girl, troubled world, world so warm, world so tender
Came to me, harmony, and I'll never let you down
Don't ever go away, no, no
Don't ever go away from me, no
I can't survive without you, girl
Don't ever let me be'cause of you are my girl (you are my girl)
My troubled world (troubled world) oh baby (world so warm) wow (world so dumb)
You came to me (came to me) in harmony (in harmony)
And I will never (you never let me down) never let you down, no baby (you are my girl)
You're my girl (troubled world) you color my world (world so warm)
You were so dumb, came to me in harmony, said I would never let you down, you were my girl, troubled world, world so warm, world so dumb
Came to me (came to me) harmony (singing in harmony) never let me down (never never let you go) come on my girl (oh baby) troubled world (oh baby) worth so long (I need you by my side) worth so tall (every day and every night) came to me
