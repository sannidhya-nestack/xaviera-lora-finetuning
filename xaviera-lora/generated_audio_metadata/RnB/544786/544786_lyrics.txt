When will I learn that you just do not love me?
I try and tell myself to let you go
But sometimes it seems that I'm your baby girl
But mostly like I am your enemy
When they look at me
Everyone can see you
I have your face
I have your voice in me
But why do you abandon me?
All my life spent praying that you'll change
Why do you abandon me?
Just when I am needing you, you leave
When will I learn?
Whenever you need me
Here I am, I give you all of me
But now I'm here alone
And you can't hear me
Don't you care what happens to me now
I just can't go on
Living with you this way
Running in and then out of my life
But why
Do you keep hurting me
You should be there to catch me when I fall
Why
Do you keep hurting me
Your love should be unconditional
La la la la la
La la la la la la
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
But why do you abandon me
All my life spent praying that you'll change
Why do you keep hurting me
Your love should be unconditional
