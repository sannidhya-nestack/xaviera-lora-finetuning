I used to be a big pile of nothing
Going round walking with my head down
Didn't find no joy nor the laughter
Thought I'd be better off alone
Well well well
Just when all the clouds seemed to multiply
She came to me and she lit the sky
Chasing the clouds away
She said rise and shine baby the sun is waiting for you
The sun is waiting for you
Hit me a ballad and let me paint your sky blue
I'll paint your sky blue
Baby made me sing and dance all night long
Gave me inspiration to write a brand new song
So this one's for my baby
Used to be alone in the weekends
Just me, the TV and having dinners with myself
Even though my friends left me hanging
Said I was becoming someone else
But just when all my friendships would sink on me
She took a dive and swam out to me
She reached out her hands when she said
Rise and shine, baby, the sun is waiting for you
Give me a palette and let me paint your sky blue
My baby made me sing and dance all night long
Gave me inspiration to write a brand new song
So this once for my baby I can buy you a rose
Buy you a big house and fancy car
But no diamond ring can tell you how wonderful you are
So all I can do is write you a song
I wrote this with love, please take it
Cause this one's for you
(And this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me (Oh yeah!) (The sun is waiting!) (The sun is waiting!) (It makes you feel like you're falling down!) (It
My baby made me sing and dance all night long
Gave me inspiration to write a brand new song
So this was for my baby (I wish I had made it a song I could sing)
Give me a ballad and let me be your disguise
So blue, you made me sing, you made me dance
You gave me inspiration, oh yeah
So this one's for you
