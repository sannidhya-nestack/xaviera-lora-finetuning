Uh, bright skies, no more cloudy days
Can't help but smile, can't wipe this grin away
Every step I take, world's in harmony
I found my rhythm, feeling so carefree
Yesterday's sorrows
Now a distant memory
The weight on my shoulders finally set free
A brand new chapter, story just begun
Every day's an adventure, endless fun
Everything is getting better, better than before
I'm soaring high and my spirit begins to soar
No more shadows, only sunshine
On my way with hope in my heart
I'm dancing through the day
Everything is getting better, better, better than before
I'm soaring higher, my spirit begins to soar
No more shadows, only sunshine on my way
With hope in my heart, I'm dancing through the day
Everything is getting better, better
Everything is getting better, better
Everything is getting better, better
I'm soaring higher
The spirit begins to soar
No more shadows, only sunshine
