I don't need love, I don't need cash
I don't need nothing but me unless
I'm on my feet, standing right here
The only thing I'll have is me, I guess
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
I don't need love, I don't need cash
I don't need nothing but me, unless
I'm on my feet, standing right here
The only thing I'll have with me, I guess
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
I don't need love
I don't need cash
I don't need nothing but me unless
I'm on my feet
Standing right here
The only thing I have is me, I guess
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
I don't need love, I don't need cash
I don't need nothing but me unless
I'm on my feet, standing right here
The only thing I'll have with me, I guess
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care, yeah
But I don't care, but I don't care, but I don't care
