Hello?
Hey baby
Uh-huh, it's you
Yeah, what's going on?
I'm so glad you called
I guess it's just not your day
You had to go and ruin it all
Bad luck will be coming your way
I found out you've been messing around
All over town
Can you believe this shit?
You can go on your way but you will have to pay
You can't get something for nothing
Don't you think you'll get by with that chill in your eye
You can't get something for nothing
Try to leave it behind you will see you will find
You can't get something for nothing
We're gonna do a stop, one, two, uh, uh
See she called me yesterday
And you were busy out working late
She said you left some things behind
Well I guess that's when I lost my mind
Don't find your things at my house anymore
Cha-ching, they're burning outside my door
Poof! You can go all your way
But you will have to pay, sing it
You can't get something for nothing
Try to think you'll get by
With that chill in your eye, yeah (No, you can't get something for nothing)
No, no, try to leave it behind
And soon you'll see you will find that
You can't get something for nothing
No, no
This kinda stuff really, it pisses me off
You know, I needed a break, man
Can you help me out here, please?
Do I sound angry?
Hell yeah
It's making me feel better already
I remember this from the other day
So y'all don't know what we talking about
But Stefan, I'm talking to you baby
You know what?
You can't get something from nothing
No, no, you can't get something from nothing
Ain't nothing wrong with a little rock and roll
Can't get, can't get, can't get, can't get
You can't get something from nothing
No joy for you
Can't get, can't get, can't get, can't get
You can't get something from nothing
But you might wonder how I learned
Keep messing around you're bound to get burned
You see I was, I was at once just a lot like you
But you know what, what you did, what you did to me
Did it too, just like me
Should be waving bye bye bye bye bye bye baby
All at once not alone
There'll be no tears to cry
You can go all your way but you will have to pay
Yeah you can't get something from nothing
Don't you think you can buy with that chill in your eye
You can't get something from nothing
You try to leave it behind soon you'll see you will find
You can't get something from nothing (bye bye)
You can't get something from nothing
Hey, you know what, Stephan, Andre, Matthias, Gustav, let's get out of here, whoo, come on man!
Did you guys hear me? I said let's get out of here
I mean who's the leader of this band?
Me!
Have a nice day
