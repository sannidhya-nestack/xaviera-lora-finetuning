Feeling lost, feeling lost
In the dark, in the dark
We were small, but now we're a part
Gotta find a way back to the start
Hearts collide, hearts collide
In the night, in the night
Searching high and low on life
Gotta hold on tight through fight
Come together, reunite
We can shine, smoke blind tonight
Come together, feel the light
Hand in hand, we'll make this right
Steps we take, steps we take
Through the storm, through the storm
Every break, every heartache
We wanna find our way to the wall
Souls connect, souls connect
Feel alive, feel alive
Never doubt, never down, they can't run a frog all the way to the wall
Come together, reunite, we light
We can shine so bright in life, tonight
Come together, feel the light, look for the light
Hand in hand, we'll make it right, you make it right
Souls connect, souls connect
Feel alive, feel alive
Never doubt, never neglect
From the top on to survive
Come together, reunite (reunite)
Think and shine, snow-breaking night (tonight)
Come together, feel the light (feel the light)
Hand in hand, we'll make it right (we'll make it right)
Souls connect, souls connect
Through the storm, through the storm
Every break and the heartache
We're gonna find our way to the wall
Souls connect, souls connect
Feelin' like you alive
Never done, never done it yet
Gonna find my way to the one
Come together, reunite
Be like, we can shine so bright in life
Two lights, come together
Feel the light, feel the light
Hand in hand, we'll make it right
You'll make it right
Step to take, step to take
Through the storm, through the storm
Every break, every heartache
Gonna find our way to the ball
Step to connect, so to connect
Feel alive, feel alive
Never doubt, never, never neglect
the fraud gone way to the wall
Souls connect, souls connect
Feel alive, feel alive
Never doubt, never neglect
The fraud will survive
Come together, reunite
We can unite
We can shine so bright tonight
Tonight, tonight
