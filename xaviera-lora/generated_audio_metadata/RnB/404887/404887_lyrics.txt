You can put it on me, you can be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
Let's return this lonely, soundin' so sexy
I just love the way you get me high
You can put it on me
You could be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home
Baby, I've been thinking'bout you
I can't wait'til you come to my room, no I
The girl has nothing on you
I just love the things you do (the things you do)
Baby, I can't wait for tonight
You're my top girl, you're just my type
I'm so glad that I'm here with you
I just wanna take you home (take you home)
Girl, let me love you, touch you tonight
I can't wait to take you home, oh
You can put it on me, you can be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
I'm spittin' this lonely, soundin' so sexy
I just love the way you get me high
You can put it on me, you can be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home
Baby, I'm just an addict for you
Feeling struck out on your love, mm-mm, nothing
Compares to when we fly
Baby it's a natural high (natural high)
I can't stop these visions of love
Girl you got me tempted to touch
I just wanna see you tonight
Best believe I'll be your type (take you home)
Girl let me love you
Touch you tonight
I can't
Wait to take you home, home
You can put it on me, you can be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
Whisper to me slowly, soundin' so sexy
I just love the way you get me high
You can put it on me, you can be my shorty
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home tonight
I just wanna take you home
Take you home
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
Take you home
Can I take
Can I take you home? Can I take you home? Can I take you home?
