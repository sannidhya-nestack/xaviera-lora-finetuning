You're the one for me there's never been anybody else
Since the day I met you, baby, I've been in your spell
I'll be good to you
Will you be good to me, baby?
I'll be good to you, ooh-ooh
I'll give you something to believe in
My love is real
The kind of love that you've been needing
Love you can feel
Now you can have what you've been dreaming
there ain't nobody else
Baby love you just the way that I do
The way that I do
Had our share of problems baby
Had our share of pain
Waited on that check a long time
Still it never came
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me, honey
I'll be good to you, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I'll give you something to believe in (my love is real)
The kind of love that you've been needing
Love you can feel
Now you can have what you've been dreaming
there ain't nobody else
Baby, love you just the way that I do
I've been waiting such a long time for us
To come back to the love and the joy that we used to have
Oh, I'll give you something to believe in
My love is real, the kind of love that you've been needing
Love you can feel, now you can have what you've been dreaming
there ain't nobody else, nobody baby
Love you just the way that I do
Nobody gonna love you like I do, baby, ooh
