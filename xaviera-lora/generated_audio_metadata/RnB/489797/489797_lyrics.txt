It's your desire for me
That makes me a mystery
It's plain to see
That I can be your fantasy
Walk down the yellow brick road
Three clicks and then we're home
With me you're never alone
Baby let me be your fantasy
It's midnight when the spell ends
And it's back to reality again
But it's fun every now and then
I can be your fantasy
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fairy tale, just like a fairy tale
Imagination takes you there, let me be your fantasy
Just like a fairy tale
Just like a fairytale
Imagination takes you there
Poison my apple tonight
With one kiss we just might
Fall in love at first sight
I can be your fantasy
If you want me that bad
One wish will make you glad
If you everything you never had
I can be your fantasy
A white horse is all we'll need
To be set free
Why can't you agree
That I can be your fantasy
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fanfare tale
Just like a fanfare tale
Imagination takes you there
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fanfare tale
Just like a fairytale
Imagination takes you there
Prince Charming you must be
To guarantee my loyalty
In my dreams your royalty
Baby you can be my fantasy
Goldilocks tried three times
To find one that fit her prime
It's only during playtime
That I can be your fantasy
A happy ending will make you see
That all you need is me
Life can be make believe
So turn the page and write your story
Hey, where'd the music go?
Imagination is the one thing that can make any dream
Come true with no limits and no fears
Any desire can become surreal
I can be yours and you can be mine
It's our story that I'm trying to define
Life can be so complicated
So baby close your eyes and
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fanfare tale
Just like a fanfare tale
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fairytale
Just like a fanfare tale
Imagination takes you there
Prince charming you must be
To guarantee my loyalty
In my dreams your royalty
With you can be my fantasy
A happy ending will make you see
That all you need is me
Life can be make believe
So turn the page and write your story
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fanfare tale
Just like a fairytale
Let me be your fantasy
Just like a fairytale
Just like a fairytale
Imagination takes you there
Let me be your fantasy
