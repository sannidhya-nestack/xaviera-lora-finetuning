I'm waiting all alone
In my house, next to my phone
Your sweet breathing on the line
Girl, I don't wanna waste no time
Everything you say and do
Every moment I'm with you
Girl, I can't wait another day
I'm in my car, I'm on my way
Gimme your heart, gimme your soul
Give me what I need, you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl
Let's get dirty tonight, woo
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Give me what I need, you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl
Let's get dirty tonight
My imagination's wild
Listen to get to you tonight
I can't breathe, can't talk, can barely walk
Cause I gotta get it right
I know you're waiting, waiting for my love
Gonna get it more as I walk through the door
And we're turning up the light, oh
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Give me what I need, you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl
Let's get dirty tonight, let's get dirty
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Give me what I need, you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl
Let's get dirty tonight, woo!
Gonna get dirty, dirty, dirty
Gonna get dirty, dirty tonight (come on, come on)
Gonna get dirty, dirty, dirty
Gonna get dirty, dirty tonight, woo!
Come on into your door
We're falling to the floor
Your body next to mine
Like we've been here for all time
I can feel your body close
As we're moving oh so slow
I'll never ever let these feelings go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Gimme your heart, gimme your soul, gimme what I need you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl, let's get dirty tonight (let's get dirty)
Gimme your heart, gimme your soul, gimme what I need you gotta give me control
Wanna rock your body, give it to me girl let's get dirty tonight
Give me your heart, give me your soul, give me what I need, you gotta give me control, I wanna rock your body, give it to me girl, let's get dirty tonight
