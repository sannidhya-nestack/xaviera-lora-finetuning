I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to me, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life, I don't know what to do with my life, I don't know what to do with my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life, I don' know what's gonna happen to my life, I don't know what's gonna happen to my life,
Like a summer's day in my memory
That's how it feels when you're lying next to me
Oh, what you do, you've made my dreams come true
I've never known romance like this
Each night I wake to that tender kiss
How can this be true, I found someone like you
I close my eyes each day
I thank God and pray
That this will never end
That this was meant to be
You are my only love
You are my destiny
Like a summer's day
So warm, so right
Each night you're near
I'm so glad you're in my life
I want you to know
I want the world to see
That this is truly love, the way it's meant to be
Not like a summer's day, when you are near you make my world seem right
Oh, I'm so glad you're here
Like a summer's day
Like a dream come true
You are the one, you are the one
And I'm here with you
Nothing to do with love and hate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, mm-mm-mm
