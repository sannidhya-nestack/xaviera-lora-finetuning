I want you to come go with me
To the land of calm forever
Come spend the day with me
Come fly away with me
Come have your way with me
Come with me
Come spend the night with me
Come take a flight with me
Come make things right with me
Come with me to a land of ecstasy
A place where we can just be you and me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Any space and time we share is a world without a care (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If we dare to go there together to a place called now and forever
Come with me, come with me
Baby won't you come with me
Come spend your life with me
Come into the light with me
Come make things bright with me
Come with me to a land of ecstasy
A place where we can just be you and me
Any space and time we share is a world without a care
If we dare to go there together
To a place called now and forever
Come spend your life with me
Come to the highest heights with me
Come with all your might with me
Just come with me
Come with me
Come with me
To a place called hell and forever
Baby won't you come with me
Baby, come with me to a place filled with ecstasy
Now and forever you and me, baby won't you come with me
Baby, won't you come with me
Come, come with me
We'll go to a place called forever
Just you and me, baby, won't you come with me
I need you, I want you
Got to have your love, girl
Baby, won't you come with me
Baby, won't you come with me? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Baby, won't you come with me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, won't you come with me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Baby, won't you come with me? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Baby, won't you come with me? (Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
