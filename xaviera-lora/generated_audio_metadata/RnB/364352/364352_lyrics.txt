If love is a crime, then I would stand guilty
Guilty of serving my time, if love is a crime
They say I stole her heart
I pleaded entrapment if she wasn't so fine
My, my, my love is a crime
Judge gave me five to ten
I said judge you better think again
I'm gonna make the woman my wife
Judge a better sentence
Me to lie
If love is a crime
Then I'd be working on a chain gang (I'd be working on a chain gang)
Happy to serve my time
If love is a crime (love is a crime)
Judge gave me five to ten
I said, "Judge, you better think again
gonna make the woman my wife
Judge, you better sentence me to life
If love is a crime"
And I'd be workin' on a chain gang (I'd be workin' on a chain gang)
Happy to serve my time if love is a crime (love is a crime)
If love is a crime (love is a crime) if love is a crime (love is a crime)
Yeah, I'm guilty, baby (love is a crime)
Guilty for lovin' you, girl (love is a crime)
Yeah, you could be my ball and chain, baby, baby, baby
My ball and chain
Love is a crime
Happy to serve my time
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
