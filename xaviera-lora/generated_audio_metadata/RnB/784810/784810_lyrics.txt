Talking out of anger
And it don't make no sense
That'll make it better
Just ruin our romance
we both know
That we still gon' be together forever
So let's not mess this up
Let's just kiss and make up
I don't wanna break up
You got an attitude, you're not in the mood
No caring words, only words to hurt
And when I cry, you cut your eyes
And I may say that the only place you need to be is away from me
But deep inside, I know I'm telling lies
'Cause we are talking (Talking ain't gonna make it)
And it don't make no sense
That'll make it better
Just ruin our romance, oh
we both know
That we're still gonna be together (forever)
So let's not mess this up
Let's just kiss and make up
I don't wanna break up
There may be times when we don't smile
But that's no means for us to leave
It's just a part of healing hearts
I started this not as a hit or miss
Loving you's the only way I'll live
So can't you see I need you here with me in my life?
I need you here with me
Our song is on, our song is on
Ooh, our song is on (It's telling us we must go on)
Telling us that we must go on (Our song is on, our song is on)
It's telling us we must go on
And I know that we are just talking out of anger
And it don't make no sense
That don't make it better
That don't make it matter
'Cause we both know (yes we know)
That we still gon' be together (oh yeah) forever
So let's not mess this up
Let's just kiss and make up
But I don't wanna break up
Forever
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Forever
I'm talking out of anger (Baby, I'm talking out of anger) (I'm talking nonsense)
That'll make it better
Just ruin our romance,'cause we both know
That we're still gonna be together forever
