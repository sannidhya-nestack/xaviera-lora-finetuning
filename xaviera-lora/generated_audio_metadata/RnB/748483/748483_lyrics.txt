Good clean fun
Good clean fun
Good clean fun
Don't want a cock or spin (good clean fun)
To fetch me puppy love (good clean fun)
I don't need jacked up (good clean fun)
To give me a buzz (good clean fun)
I don't want any smoke (good clean fun)
I wanna keep my mind clean (good clean fun)
All I really want right now is you here
I wanna get me some good clean fun
Nothing lethal, get it set on stone
A sure cure when you're feeling down
High time for some good clean fun
And if you wonder who I wanna have it with
Baby you are the one (good fun)
I hear good music (good, clean fun)
Can make some people stay (good, clean fun)
Lay it straight, oh good music (good, clean fun)
They'll love it either way (good, clean fun)
Yeah, I know good music (good, clean fun)
Can make you feel so high (good, clean fun)
But all I wanna hear is the echo of your smile
I wanna get me some good clean fun
Nothing lethal, get it set on stone
A sure cure when you're feeling low
High time for some good clean fun
And if you wonder who I wanna have it with
Baby you are the one (good clean fun) yeah yeah
If you wonder who I wanna have it with
Baby you're the one (good clean fun) yeah (good clean fun)
(Good clean fun)
Mmm baby baby you're the one (good clean fun)
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
