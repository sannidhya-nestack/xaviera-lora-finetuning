I hope these words can say
Exactly what I'm feeling here today
I thought that I would never love again
Then you came and shaked my heart again
I knew that I found someone special in you forever
I can live my life always with us together
I know that you were placed here with me
My angels
Girl my happiness begin when I lay my eyes on you
When I saw you I seen joy and love
The peace that only comes from up above
I lose my breath when you are near
So I'd rather be breathless
I believe that we will bring to earth (our special)
A gift of love for all its worth
For you will see, please believe
I'd rather be breathless
I close my eyes to see
The life that will begin through you and me
I'm proud of what the love in us could bring
Anything to say these words again, I love you
I found someone special in you forever
I can live my life always with us
Together I know
That you were placed here beside me
My angels
Can my happiness begin when I lay my eyes on you
When I saw you I sing joy and love
A peace that only comes from up above
I lose my breath when you are near
So I'd rather be breathless
I believe that we will bring to earth
A special gift of love for all its worth
For you will see, please believe
I'd rather be breathless
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
When I saw you I said, "Jodie, in love"
A peace that only comes from up above
I lose my breath, even when you are near
So I'd rather be breathless, say (I believe we will breathe together)
Still waiting for special gift of love for all its worth
Baby, I see, I see a new life with you
I'd rather be breathless without you
Baby, I don't know what I'd do
So I'm gonna stay right here and bring it
I give a love for all that's worth
For all its worth I'd rather be breathless
