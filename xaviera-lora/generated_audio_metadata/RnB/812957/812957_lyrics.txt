I wanna buy you diamonds
I wanna buy you pearls
Fly you to every corner of the world
If I only had the means I'd give you everything
But till then have some faith in our little dream
You gotta be all in our love
All in on love, all in on love, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
All in on love, all in on love, all in on love, you gotta be, you gotta be
I'm gonna work my tail off and make a happy home
I'll fix your car, I'll even fix your telephone
I am gonna cherish you like you have never been
Love will light a fortune, baby, if you will join in
You gotta be all in on love, all in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
All in all love, all in all love, all in all love, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be, you gotta be
All in all love, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in on love (you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be)
You gotta be all in on love (you gotta be all in on love)
You have a lot of fortune (you gotta be, you gotta be)
If you out your knee for it (you gotta be all in on love)
If you say it loud
Don't play with those bad boys, they'll mess you up inside
They don't give a damn, they're gonna take you for a ride
Give you lots of love
Words but nothing from the heart
Our love is special so come on and take part
You gotta be all in on love, all in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in on love, all in on love, all in on love
Hey, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in on love
All in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, all in all love
All in our love, all in our love, all in our love
All in our love you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
All in our love, you gotta be, all in our love, all in our love
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in our love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be
