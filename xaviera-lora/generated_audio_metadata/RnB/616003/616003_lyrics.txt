Lady I see you shine day to day
You brighten up my life in a special way
I gladly cover you when skies begin to grey
Never you question why I love you mama again
And I'm sorry things usually always fall through
For you
And I'm sorry people
Don't always seem
To notice the truth
But I do, I see
Ladies are the beginning of my love
Ladies are at the end of my heart
Baby, you should know, you should know, you should know
So my my, you should know, so my my, you should know
So my my, you should know, so my mine, that I love you so
And I don't wanna see you stressin', I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you struggle, hustlin', bustlin'
I don't wanna see you down, I just wanna see you laugh
See you smile, see you walk, see you fly
See you give love a try, see you dance in the sky
In the sky, see you dance in the sky
In the sky, see you dance in the sky
Ladies are the beginning of my love
Ladies are at the end of my love
(That's why I love you, I love you)
Baby (You should know, you should know, you should know)
So my mind (You should know)
So my mind (You should know)
So my mind (You should know)
So my mind (You should know, you should know)
So my mind (You should know, you should know, you should know)
Don't you ever wonder
Don't you ever wonder
Don't you ever wonder
Ladies are the beginning
Ladies are at the ending of my heart
Don't ever ask me why
Ladies you should know, you should know, you should know
Ladies are the beginning of my heart
Ladies are at the ending of my heart
Baby, you should know, you should know, you should know
