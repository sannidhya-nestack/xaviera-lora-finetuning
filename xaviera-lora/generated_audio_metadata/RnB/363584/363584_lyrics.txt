You gotta be strong, whoa
You gotta be strong, oh
You're searching through the streets
Looking for a way out
But you can't find your way to get through here
Maybe you're seeking in all the wrong places
And a positive change is something you fear
I got to find a way out, that's what you said
Find a way, I got to find a way out
You got to find a way
I got to find a way out
That's what you said (finally)
I got to find a way out
Somehow you gotta change your course
When you look over your life
And come to the realization
That nothing is gonna change on its own
That's when it's time for you
To make that change
Because if you don't
You'll never be strong
I got to find a way out
That's what you say
I got to find a way out
You got to find a way
I got to find a way out
That's what you say
I got to find a way out
You've got to find a way
Oh, mm-hmm, hey
You gotta find a way, find a way
There's too much danger for you to stay (yeah)
You gotta find a way
Find a way, keep searching
There's so much trouble coming your way
You're gonna have troubles
Find a way, if you
There's too much danger for you to stay
You got to find a way
Find a way, troubles
There's so much trouble coming your way
Danger, danger
Danger (there's too much danger for you to say)
