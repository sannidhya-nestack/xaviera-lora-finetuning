The winds of change are blowing across these islands
Taking the beauty away from this island paradise
Are there others who've become sad, oh, as I have
As we watch the tides wash away our island life
Like the seas around us
This land was once so pure
For the people of the land
They lived upon
No greed, no hate, no hunger
No prejudice at all
Aloha way of life
It just lived on
Now the rainbows don't come'round much anymore
And the clouds they weep as they watch the sun go down
I pray the gods will wave their mighty hands once more
Then the beauty lost can once again be found
Now we've watched the land begin to let us see
That we must save this paradise before it's gone
The wind, the rain, volcanoes
They will rage if we don't see
That this greed will bring the end
Should it go on
Our Hawaiian music all but gone
Let it play again
Our Hawaiian folk let's give them back
Old Waikiki
Let the folks who come to visit see Hawaii once again
Then they will know that this is still the place to be
Now the rainbows don't come'round much anymore
And the clouds they weep as they watch the sun go down
I pray that gods will wave their mighty hands once more
Then the beauty lost can once again be found
