Stars shine bright above As we walk along the shore
Whispers of the ocean make us want for more
Lanterns light the pathways
Leading us to dreams
In this tropical night
Nothing's as it seems
Tropical nights under moonlit skies
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We dance together in a sweet romance
Waves crash on the rocks
Singing us a tune
Palm trees swaying gently
Beneath the silver moon
We find a quiet cold
Where the world is still
In this tropical haven
Our hearts are fulfilled
Tropical nights under moonlit skies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tropical nights under moonlit skies, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We danced together in a sweet romance
As the firelight flickers and the night grows deep
We share our secrets in the warm night's heat
Island rhythms guide us to a place so rare
In these tropical nights
Our love is everywhere
Tropical nights under moonlit skies, oh oh oh oh
Tropical nights under moonlit skies, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We danced together in our sweet romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
