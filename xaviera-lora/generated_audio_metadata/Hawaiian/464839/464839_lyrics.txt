I got a feeling but I don't know why
It popped right up from my left hand side
Made me think about another time
When we were up and we felt alive with you and me
We just gotta hope there's more to see
And I know we got bills to pay
And I know we got stuff to say
Deep down we're just the same
Rolling on to play this game but why
Oh, why, why can't we just smile today, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Let's just smile today, eh, eh, eh, Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I can see but I must be blind
what we had is getting hard to find
I try to find another way to say
We gotta make this change today, it's you and me
I really hope there's more to see
And I know we got bills to pay
And I know we got stuff to say
Deep down we're just the same
Rolling on to play this game
But why, oh why
Why can't we just smile today?
Oh, let's just smile today
Ooh, let's just smile today, yeah baby
Oh baby, let's just smile today, ay-ay
Come on baby, let's just smile today
