Early morning on the Napale coast
With every wave I love you the most
Cold white whispers through the ancient trees
Then this island song we find our peace
Hear the ocean's gentle sigh
Underneath the Hanalei sky
Koa dreams
Where the mountains meet the sea
You and me
Where we're meant to be
In this paradise so serene
Living out our koa dreams
Wallowa river flowing deep and strong
Carrying our love along secret beaches hidden coasts
Everywhere with you my heart rolls
I hear the ocean's gentle sigh
Underneath the Hanalei sky
Kawaii dreams, where the mammals meet the sea
You and me, where we're meant to be
In this paradise so serene, living out our Kawaii dreams
Feel the little lighthouse guiding the way
As the sun sets on another day
With every star that lights the night
Our love shines ever bright
Feel the little lighthouse guiding the way
As the sun sets on another day
With every star that lights the night
Our love shines ever bright
Oh, our dreams, where the mountains meet the sea
You and me, where we're meant to be
In this paradise so serene
Living out our co-op dreams
Living out our co-op dreams
