Our heart was charred, where dreams will begin
In your arms, I feel the wind
From Makapua to the North Shore's grace
Every corner of this place
Pearl of the Pacific, where our love sets sail
In the island's breeze, we prevail
From the mountains to the oceans wide
With you I'll forever glide
Kylo is weighty, soft and warm
In your love I find my calm
Why he can ice bright and bold
Our story in this hour is told
Beneath the Banyan's ancient shade
In your love I'm unafraid
With every wave that meets the shore
In your heart I find more
Pearl of the Pacific where dreams take flight
In the moon's gentle light
From sunrise to evening's glow
In your love I'll always grow
Pearl of the Pacific where our love sets sail
In the island's breeze we prevail
From the mountains to the oceans wide
With you I'll forever glide
Kyle was way soft and warm
In your love I'll find my calm
Why keep your nights bright and bold
Our story in the silence told
Beneath the banyan's ancient shade
In your love I'm unafraid
With every wave that meets the shore
In your heart I'll find more
Beneath the Banyan's ancient shade
In your love I'm unafraid
With every wave that meets the shore
In your heart I'll find more
Pearl of the Pacific where dreams take flight
In the moon's gentle light
From sunrise to the evening's glow
In your love I'll always grow
Pearl of the Pacific where our love sets sail
In the island's breeze we prevail
From the mountains to the oceans wide
In your love I'll always grow
