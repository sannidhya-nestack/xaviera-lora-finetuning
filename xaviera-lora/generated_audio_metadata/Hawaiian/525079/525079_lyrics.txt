Yesterday I rode some waves, my old spotted Waikiki
Was a long day, so I thought that I would lay under that coconut tree
Wasn't long'til I was gone, the sun still on my face
Felt good to rest my body while I dreamt about a place
Hotels were gone, just trees and grass
The sky was deeper blue
The waves were bigger than I'd ever seen
And the mountains were bright green
So I wandered down the sand
Saw a village by the sea
The smiling faces on the children
Brought a smile to me
A fishing boat was coming in
And some voices called to me
Saw a tutu and tutu kane
And they might call to me
Where you come from boy they ask
In native Hawaiian words
I never knew I could understand
The language I just heard
I said another place was where I was
Before this dream began
They just smiled and said
Come inside boy
Share some things with you
They told stories about the gods
Who protected the land and the sea
The many who never worked at night
While the people were asleep
Well the hour was late
And as I fell asleep
I felt gently around my neck
The gift they gave and Tutu's kiss she placed upon my cheek
While I slept I saw the beauty of the goddess of the fire
In rainbows and blue skies like I've never seen before
Then I woke up in a little while there were people all around
The buildings that were gone last night were there just like before
So I walked back to the place where I lay down yesterday
And gathered up my things so I could start back on my way
Then around my neck I felt the gift, the gift that Tutu gave
The Koa peace she wrote these words
Ahui hoa alika
We always cherish time spent with visitors from your day
