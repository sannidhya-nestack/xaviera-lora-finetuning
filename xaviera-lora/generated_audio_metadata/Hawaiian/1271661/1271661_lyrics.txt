Beneath the swaying palms where the ocean meets the land
We find our sweet escape in this island wonderland
Tropical breezes whisper tales of old and new
Every moment here feels like a dream come true
Island serenade where the waves sing along
With the rhythm of the sea our hearts belong
Under the starlit sky
In this tranquil place
We find our melody
In each other's embrace
Sailing on a catamaran
The horizon's our guide
But dolphins dancing near
In the sparkling tide
From sunrise to sunset
We explore the shore
In this paradise
We'll forever adore
Island serenade
Where the waves sing along
With the rhythm of the sea
Our hearts belong
Under the starlit sky
In this tranquil place
We find our melody
In each other's embrace
Sailing on a catamaran
The horizon's our guide
With dolphins dancing near
In the sparkling tide
From sunrise to sunset
We explore the shore
In this paradise
We'll forever adore
Nightfall brings the firelight and the ukulele's tune
Dancing in the moonlight beneath the silver moon
With every strumming beat our spirits are set free
In this island serenade just you and me
Island serenade where the waves sing along
With the rhythm of the sea our hearts belong
Under the starlit sky
In this tranquil place
We find our melody
In each others embrace
