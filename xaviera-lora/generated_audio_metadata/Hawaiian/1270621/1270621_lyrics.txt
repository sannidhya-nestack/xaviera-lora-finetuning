Waves roll in, palm trees sway
Another perfect island day
From my ukulele we gonna play
Worries float away
Aloha vibes, island style
Kick back and stay awhile
Blue skies and ocean smiles
Let's cruise for miles and miles
Sand between my toes, breeze in my hair
Good friends and good times without a care
Barbecue on the beach, watch the sunset glow
This is all we need, don't you know?
Aloha vibes, island style
Kick back and stay a while
Blue skies and ocean smiles that cruise for miles and miles
Sand between my toes, greasing my hair
Good friends in good times without a care
Barbecue on the beach, watch the sunset glow
This is all we need, don't you know?
Aloha vibes, island style
Kick back and steady your while
Blue skies and ocean smiles
Let's cruise for miles and miles
Life moves slow when you're living right
Hula girls dance under moonlight
Tiki torches flickering bright
Paradise found hold on tight
Aloha vibes island style
Kick back and say, "Oh, wow"
Blue skies, ocean slums, let's cruise for miles and miles
Life moves slow when you're living right
Hula girls dance under moonlight
Tiki torches flickering bright
Paradise found, hold on tight
Aloha vibes, island style
Kick back and stay awhile
Blue skies and ocean smiles
Let's cruise for miles and miles
