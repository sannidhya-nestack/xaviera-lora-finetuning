Walking on the sunlight shores with you by my side
The ocean song is calling with the morning tide
Seashells and starfish
Treasures at our feet
In this sunlit paradise
Everything's complete
Sunlit shores where our hearts align
In this island bliss you are mine
Waves and sun, endless skies
In this paradise love never dies
Surfboards and sunshine, riding every wave
Moments in the sunlight, memories we'll save
Tropical flowers blooming, colors all around
In the sunlit paradise, love is what we found
Sunlit shores where our hearts align
In this island bliss you are mine
Waves and sun, endless skies
In this paradise love never dies
Twilight brings a calm as the day turns to night
Holding you so close everything feels right
Stars above us twinkle in a sky so clear
In this sunlit paradise love is always near
Sunlit shores where our hearts align
In this island bliss you are mine
Waves and sun, endless skies
In this paradise love never dies
