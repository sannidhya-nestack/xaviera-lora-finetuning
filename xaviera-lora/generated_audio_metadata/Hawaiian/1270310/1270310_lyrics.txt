Golden sand beneath our feet
Wind swept shores where hearts can meet
Coconut palms sway with grace
Love's reflection on your face
Feel the spirit, feel the glow
In this island we call home
Island, dreaming, hearts are gleaming
In your arms my soul's believing
Every moment pure delight
Island dreams and moonlight
Lanterns glow as night descends
Time with you I hope never ends
Whispered vowels under the stars
Echoes of our sweet guitars
Feel the spirit, feel the glow
In this island we call home
Island, dreaming, hearts are gleaming
In your arms my soul's believing
Every moment pure delight
Island dreams in moonlight
Crystal waters at your skies
With you love will always rise
In this haven dreams come true
Island love just me and you
Island, dreaming, hearts are gleaming
In your arms my soul's believing
Every moment, pure delight
Island dreams in the moonlight
Crystal waters, edges, skies
With you love will always rise
In this haven dreams come true
Island love, just me and you
Island dreaming, hearts are gleaming
In your arms my soul's believing
Every moment pure delight
Island dreams in the moonlight
I love dreams in the moonlight
