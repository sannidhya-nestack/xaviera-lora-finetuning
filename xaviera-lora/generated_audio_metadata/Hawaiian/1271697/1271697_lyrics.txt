Morning sun is shining on the Emerald Bay
Children's laughter echoing as we start the day
Canoes glide through the water, paddles in the sea
In this island rhythm, we'll find time to think
Island rhythms, flowing through our veins
In this tropical haven, love remains
With each heartbeat and every ocean tide
We'll dance together, side by side
Climbing to the mountain top with a view so wide
Rainforests and valleys where secrets hide
Hand in hand we journey through this paradise
Every moment treasured, every memory dies
Island rhythms, rolling through our veins
In this tropical haven love remains
With each heartbeat and every ocean tide
We'll dance together, side by side
Nightfall brings the music, drums begin to play
Stars above are twinkling, guiding our way
With the rhythm of the islands, we let our spirits soar
In this island rhythm we find time to think
Island rhythms flowing through our veins
In this tropical haven love remains
With each heartbeat and every ocean tide
We'll dance together side by side
Nightfall brings the music, drums begin to play
Stars above are twinkling, guiding our way
With the rhythm of the islands, we let our spirits soar
In this magical place, we love more and more
Island rhythms, flowing through our veins
In this tropical haven, love remains
With each heartbeat, and every ocean tide
We'll dance together, side by side
Every ocean tide, we'll dance together, some time
