Sure your eyes melting in the sun
Beach days only just begun
Surfboards start to wind me up, babe
Geckos jump, hear what they say
Sipping pineapple punch
A biscuit's dreams caught a hunch
This is where I'm meant to be
Soul dancing wild and free
Now polycliffs touch the sky
Our eager canoes glide by
Plumeria scents the air
Aloha spirit everywhere
Sipping pineapple punch
Hibiscus dreams got a hunch
This is where I'm meant to be
Soul dancing wild and free
Volcanoes glow at twilight hour
Feels like magic, nature's power
Slide key guitars, mellow tune
Under a Polynesian moon
Sipping pineapple punch
Hibiscus dreams got a hunch
This is where I'm meant to be
Soul dancing wild and free
Volcanoes glow at twilight hour
Feels like magic, nature's power
Saki guitars, mellow tune
Under a Polynesian moon
Sipping pineapple punch
A biscuit stream's got a hunch
This is where I'm meant to be
Soul dancing wild and free
