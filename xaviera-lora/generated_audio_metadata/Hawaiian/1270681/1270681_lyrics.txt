Misty mountains, coffee fields
Morning dew on lava shields
Roosters crow at break of day
Kona coast where I'll stay
Kona coffee sunrise, open sleepy eyes
Tropical fruits on my plate, island time
Never late
Paddling out on outrigger
Spinner dolphins getting bigger
Petroglyphs tell ancient tales
Whales breaching flukes and tails
Corner coffee sunrise
Open sleepy eyes
Tropical fruits on the plate
Island time, never late
Caterpillars dance in moonlight
Volcanoes glow in the night
Carve a bowl, cast around
Slacky guitar, it's mellow sound
Corner coffee, sunrise
Open sleepy eyes
Tropical fruits on a plate
Island time, never late
Pantorys dance in moonlight
Volcanoes glow in the night
Carve a bowl, passed around
Slide key guitars, mellow sound
Corner coffee, sunrise
Open sleepy eyes
Tropical fruits on the plate
Island time, never late
