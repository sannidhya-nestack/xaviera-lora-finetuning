Tropical sun, warm up my skin
Island vibes, let the magic begin
Pineapple dreams and ocean blue
Every moment feels brand new
Feel the music in the air
Island rhythm everywhere
Dance through the island rhythm let the waves set you free
Under the stars we'll make a memory in this paradise by the sea
Lili around your neck, flowers in bloom
Surfing waves right in the afternoon
Laughter and love in the island breeze
Together here just you and me
Feel the music in the air
Island rhythm everywhere
Dance through the island rhythm
Let the waves set you free
Under the stars we'll make a memory
In this paradise by the sea
Bonfires light the sandy shore
Swaying gently asking for more
Island magic in the moonlight
Let's dance together through the night
Dance to the island rhythm
Let the waves set you free
Under the stars we'll make a memory
In this paradise by the sea
As the sun sets painting the sky
Promise me this moment won't say goodbye
We'll keep this rhythm in our hearts
Island love never apart
