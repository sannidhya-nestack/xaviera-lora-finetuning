I am your wave and you, you are my sea
We'll be together
And now I can see that I am the flower and you gave me mercy together
Everything that we need is you and I
One special song vibrating together you and I
One special love, vibrating together
You are the light
That makes my colors bright
And breathing in the wind
Please spread my scent with your wings
You and I
One special song vibrating together you and I
One special love vibrating together
Together, my home, my home
Mahalo my island
