Coconut farms swaying slow
Lava rocks where flowers grow
Gentle waves kiss the shore
Island life, I ask for more
We're on island time
No reason, no rhyme
Just the sun and the sand
And a cold drinking hand
Rainbows arch across the sky
Gentle mist as clouds roll by
Slide key guitar on the breeze
Hulu girls dance with ease
We're on island time
No reason, no rhyme
Just the sun and the sand
And a cold drinking hen
Blue owl nights under the stars
Tiki torches near and far
Kaluwake and boy simple life
Simple joy
We're on island time
No reason no rhyme
Just the sun and the sand
And a cold drinking hand
A drinking hand
As the day fades to night everything feels just right
No rush, no fuss, no stress, island time, nothing less
Nothing less
Nothing less
Oh, oh, oh
