Golden sands in ocean blue, morning light so clear, walking hand in hand with you, everything feels new, coconut trees whisper low, secrets of the breeze, in the silence gentle glow, our hearts find peace
Island of songs soft and sweet
Oh, in this place our hearts meet
Snuggle into coral reefs, colors all around
Every corner hides a tale in this sacred ground
Evening brings the firelight
Dancing shadows play
In this silent warm embrace
We'll forever stay
Island love song, soft and sweet
Oh, oh, oh
In this place our hearts beat
Stars are lying above us, lighting up the night
We find our own oasis in the moon's soft light
With each gentle heartbeat, under skies so white
In this silent paradise, love will be our guide
I love song, soft and sweet, oh, oh, oh
In this place, our hearts meet
Stars align above us, lighting up the night
We find our own oasis in the moon's sunlight
With your gentle heartbeat
Under skies so wide
This silent paradise
Love will be your guide
Island love songs, soft and sweet
Oh, oh, oh
In this place our hearts meet
