Under the palm trees the waves was for low
The sun kissed sand and the breezes blow
A ukulele strums a gentle tune
Hawaiian nights under a silver moon
Aloha my love in the island breeze
Dancing together under swaying trees
With every wave my heart sings true
Forever in paradise with you
Sticky torches light our sandy path
Barefoot dreams in a seaside bath
Hibiscus blooms in your hair so bright
Magic in the air all through the night
Aloha my love in the island breeze
Dancing together under swaying trees
With every wave my heart sings true
Forever in paradise with you
Kiki torches light our sandy path
Barefoot dreams in a seaside bath
Hibiscus blooms in your hair so bright
Magic in the air all through the night
Aloha my love in the island breeze
Dancing together under sweaty trees
With every wave my heart sings true
Forever in paradise with you
Stars above, reflecting in the sea
You and I, where we're meant to be
Whispered secrets in the night so clear
In your arms there's nothing to fear
A long hum of love in the island breeze
Dancing together on the swaying trees
With every wave my heart sings true
Forever in paradise with you as the dawn breaks
A new day has started, Hawaiian sun
With you in my heart
We'll write our story in the sand
Hand in hand in this promised land
