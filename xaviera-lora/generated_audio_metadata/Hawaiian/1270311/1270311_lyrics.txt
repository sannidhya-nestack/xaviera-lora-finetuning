Sunrise paints the sky with you so bright
Waiting dreams in the morning light
Footprints in the sand hand in hand
Living life in this island wonderland
Feel the wire heartbeat
Pounding in the rhythm of the waves
Where love and nature meet
In this paradise that's sage
Rainbow arches over mountains green
Crystal waters in a perfect scene
Whale songs echo in the deep blue
Hawaiian magic, pure and true
Feel the Hawaiian heartbeat
Pounding in the rhythm of the waves
Where love and nature meet
In this paradise that's sage
Rainbow arches over mountains green
Crystal waters in a perfect scene
Whale songs echo in the deep blue
Hawaiian magic, pure and true
Feel the Hawaiian heartbeat
Pounding in the rhythm of the wave
Where love and nature meet
In this paradise that saves
The doorway ladies play a serenade
Under stars where wishes are made
Island breezes whisper soft and low
In this place where love will always grow
Feel the widened heartbeat
Pounding in the rhythm of the waves
Where love and nature meet
In this paradise that's sage
As the day fades into night's embrace
I find my holding a smiling face
Would it ever be our love's complete
In this Hawaiian heartbeat so sweet
