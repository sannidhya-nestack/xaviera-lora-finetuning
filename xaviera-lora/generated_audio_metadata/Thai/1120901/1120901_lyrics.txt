Start from nothing
Who could believe
We can't speak
Even we don't speak
Start with one dream
But now it's finished
We're not the same street
For find what we need
You care of money
And you still selfish
You don't care for me
When I want love I stop to think
Can't you see what I mean
By your weight you kill
What we had built
Why you don't want to keep everything?
for you (for you)
I never do good (I never do good)
When I try to do everything makes me lose you (lose you)
But I'm not fooled (but I'm not fooled)
I just try to kiss and take you on my knees
I need you
Too much fight when we open the light
Why you lie when you say you never hide
I know your fears but can't you see my tears in my life
I need someone close to me
for you (for you)
I never do good (I never do good)
When I try to do everything makes me lose you (lose you)
But I'm not fooled (but I'm not fooled)
I just try to give
I beg you on my knees I need
You
