Who?
Who?
(MultiCom Jingle)
The winged serpent stirs
From the slumber deep inside
Patiently awaits
To take you on an astral ride
Beckoning with seductive tales
Of secret realms behind the veils
Worlds of holy ecstasy
Just be with me
The snake continues to unwind
Reality must stay behind
Rainbows spiral up the spine
And you are flying
Before you endless treasure looms
A thousand-petaled lotus blooms
Emptiness the shining jewel
Just be willing
Exalted, Beloved
(MultiCom Jingle)
