(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Away
Away
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere, I am not going anywhere, I am not going anywhere,
(I know I'm not the only one who's feeling this way)
I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun, I'm not afraid of the sun,
And I love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I'll be back in just a few minutes, but I hope you have a good night.
