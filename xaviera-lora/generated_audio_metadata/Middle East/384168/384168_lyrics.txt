Isis, Inala, Astarte, Kalima, Shakti, Athena, Aphrodite, Gaia
I am the dancer in the waves upon the shore
I am the spirit of the worlds forevermore
I am the beauty of the trees
I am the power of the seas
I bring the mighty to their knees
I am the strength within the strong
I am the music in the song
I am the blowing of the wind
I am where healing must begin
I am the one
I am desire and a kiss, eternal bliss
I am the growth within the seed
I am the food for every need
I am the artist in the art
I am compassion in the heart
I am the wind
I am the rain
I am the healer of all pain
I am an endless mystery
Be of me
