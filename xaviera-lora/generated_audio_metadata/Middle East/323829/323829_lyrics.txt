The economy, the economy is bad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
We need to get involved

We need two more hands together
Mother used to say
Golden boy
The real man is the one who knows how to wake up earlier
Yes that's, never be lazy, yes that's
Always try to do the best you can, I will do it that
Always make it happen, yes I will do it
Oh, we need to watch, ah, ah, oh, ah, make it happen, make it happen
Why are the high bills from the hospitals?
People are losing their jobs, I cannot afford them
I'm working 44 hours a week, yes, not 40
But taxes so high
My dad used to say, Golden boy, the economy is bad, this world is not for lazy people, people are losing their jobs, the real man is the man who knows how to wake up earlier
You better do it right now (yes) not tomorrow (yes) because you never know (you never know)
You better (you better) you better raise your hands (in this house)
You never complain about the economy
Yes, the economy is so bad, we all know
The economy is bad, bad, very bad, bad, very bad
Bad people are losing their jobs
They don't have something to eat
We all need to get involved
They don't have nothing to eat
We need to build a country
No more waste of energies
Power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power together power
This world is not for lazy people
You know, don't try to be cool
Your heart always have been eating
And feed, and feed the hungry
You got it, feed
We are not the poor as Mr. Hood
This is a spiritual life
You will never et that my son
Be professional in your work, be, be professional, do it right now
Be professional, do it right now
Ah, help the needy, help the needy, help the needy
Why are the hospitals so expensive right now?
The hospitals are expensive you already know
People are losing their jobs, I cannot afford
People are losing their jobs
They don't have nothing to eat, I prefer dying
Oh, we need to work
