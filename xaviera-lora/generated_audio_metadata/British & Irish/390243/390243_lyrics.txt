Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a ship that might go down sweet in time
Love flirts with your fate when it comes to you too late
It's the blood on the knife of your tormented wife
In the clouds you dreamed of the loves that you had
It's a gun that you fired at the mother who always deserved
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
