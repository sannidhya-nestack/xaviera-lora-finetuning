I've failed my superiors, I've done it before
But this time I beat my own tail
There's no turning back now, I'll go down for sure
This time they'll put me in jail
When I'm old and grey as well
They'll open the door to my prison cell
They'll tell me to run and a free man I'll be
And so I'll have paid for the mistakes I made
Back when I was twenty-three
I was careless with tasks that were given to me
I'm no one to blame but myself
I'm sure I'll be shot now or hung from a tree
Or just put away on a shelf
When I'm old and grey as well
They'll open the door to my prison cell
They'll tell me to run and a free man I'll be
And so I'll have paid for the mistakes I made
Back when I was twenty-three
Don't know why I don't take the chances I get
To put a quick end to this strife
I took it too far and for that I'm in debt
This time I'll pay with my life
When I'm old and grey as well
They'll open the door to my prison cell
They'll tell me to run and a free man I'll be
And so I'll have paid for the mistakes I made
Back when I was twenty-three
When I'm old and grey as well
They'll open the door to my prison cell
They'll tell me to run and a free man I'll be
And so I'll have paid for the mistakes I made
Back when I was twenty three
