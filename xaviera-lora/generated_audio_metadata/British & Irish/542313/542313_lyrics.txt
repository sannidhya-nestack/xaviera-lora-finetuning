Every day I pass you by
Squatting, staring at the skies
Down to meet the boys I go
I say hello to Donnie Gojo
Old Ireland, he's been up and down
He's done his bit in every town
Sun and rain and sleet and snow
Back he comes, old Donnie Gojo
Holding out his hands at you
Just a little coin or two
On the pavement time goes slow
Singing songs, old Donnie Gojo
Not a worry, not a care
Old Twinkly Eyes will smile and stare
Until he gets your money, oh
They all know him, Donnie Gold Joe
Donnie Gold Joe
Donnie Gold Joe
Does anyone know
Where did he go?
Donnie Gold Joe
Oh welcome stranger, welcome back
All you need is a six pack
The nuns will feed you that you know
At their window lay Knox, Donnie, Gold Joe
Up again so bright and early after his bread marmalade tea
Upstairs kids play piano, off to the hills goes Donnie Gold Show
To the same old spot or maybe further, depends on the same old weather
East or west this man could go, he's getting old now Donnie Gold Show
He's made it here through all those years
Still away from it all he steers
Doesn't know why, he'll never know, that's what happened
Did Donnie go, Joe?
Did Donnie go, Joe?
Donnie go, Joe?
Does anyone know?
Where did he go?
Donnie go, Joe?
Just let it go one day and ran
This new life he began
His wife she married another man
So lost in grief is Donegal Joe
Don't tell anybody the reason why
Thinking back might make him cry
He had a big house, lots of dough
A day labourer was Donnie Gojo
It's best to et what didn't go
What might have happened he'll never know
He surrendered to the winds down below
From the mountains down all rivers flow
That's why I always say hello
That's why I always say hello
Destroyed by love not money oh
My only hero
Donnie Gojo, Donnie Gojo, Donnie Gojo
Does anyone know where did he go?
Donnie Gojo
One day I gave him fifty pence, he danced a jig
I had no sense so he wouldn't let me go
Till I had a drink with Donnie Gold Joe
Where he is now I don't know
Where he is I just don't know
Died in a ditch, I imagine so
Is she really worth it?
Donnie Gold Joe, Donnie Gold Joe
Donnie Gold Joe, does anyone know?
Where did he go?
Donnie Gojo
Donnie Gojo
Donnie Gojo
Does anyone know?
Where did he go?
Donnie Gojo
