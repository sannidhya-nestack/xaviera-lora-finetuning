Moonie the Donegal Fiddler, traveled throughout the land
He fiddled for dances, weddings and wakes, he was in great demand
Though a good natured, a humorous man, never drunk and always true
Still Mooney's wife disparaged his life, his music she did greatly rue
She detested the music so she could marry a quaver stand
Especially the fiddle did she scorn, till one night her lovely man
Gathered up his fiddle and some clothes, as her scorn in his head did pound
And shuttin' his door at the stroke of twelve, he set off for Donegal town
She called the fiddle the devil's box and Mooney never knew why
But he found out that moonlit night under the Donegal sky
Out on the road under silvery moon he began to better feel
By the cemetery he did pass he whistled a merry reel
He stopped to rest against a ditch catch in sight of a wee hooded man
With sooty clothes and eyes aglow he stretched out a claw like hand
"Stranger dear, what have we here?" The hooded man did scowl
Pointing to Mooney's fiddle, he said, "Do you mind if I play a while?"
"Of course, good sir, please play away," Mooney, he replied
And handing over his fiddle, he grinned under the starlit sky
He played an ancient tune, it said, "The Jig in a Pipin' Style"
The tip of his bow whistled and glowed, Mooney listened all the while
Being quick to learn, he had to turn the second time he heard it
The tune was done like last night's fun, leaving Mooney most delighted
She called to fiddle the devil's box, and Mooney never knew why
But he found out that Moon lit night under the Donegal sky
Well, Moony said, shaking his head
That music should bring you great fame
To further our acquaintance
Would you please bless me with your name?
The stranger stood, removing his hood
Revealing two horns on his pate
And the elves above the devil himself
Direct from Gehenna's dark gate
Moony looks straight into Satan's red eyes with a steady and fearless gaze
I swear to my time at music so fine could certainly light hell's blaze
I consider myself a lucky man to have met you this good night, mister
So shake hands with your relations, sir
You see, I'm married to your sister
