As I went out through Dublin City
Around the hour of twelve at night
Who should have spied but a Spanish lady
Washing her feet by candlelight
First she washed them then she dragged them
Over a fire of embery coals
And in all my life I never did see
A mate so sweet about the souls
She had twenty, eighteen, sixteen, fourteen
Twelve, ten, eight, six, four, two, none
She had nineteen, seventeen, fifteen, thirteen
Eleven, nine, seven, five, three and one
I stopped to look, but the watchman passed
Says, "Hey, young fella, now the night is late
Away with you home, or I will wrestle you straight away to the bridewell gate"
But I got a look from the Spanish lady
Hot as a fire of emery coals
And in all my life I never did see
A maid so neat about the souls
She had twenty, eighteen, sixteen, fourteen
Twelve, ten, eight, six, four, two, none
She had nineteen, seventeen, fifteen, thirteen
Eleven, nine, seven, five, three, one
I wandered north and I wandered south
By Stoney Batter and Patricks Close
Up and around by the Gloucester Dam
And back by Nepertandy's House
Then as I walked back through Dublin City
Just as the dawn was breaking on
Who should I spy but the Spanish lady, as I was weary and foot-sore?
She had a heart so filled with loving
And that love she longed to share
And in all my life I never did meet a maid who had so much to spare
She had twenty, eighteen, sixteen, fourteen
Twelve, ten, eight, six, four, two, nine
She had 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3 and 1
Old age has laid her hand upon me
Cold as a fire of ashy coals
And gone is the lovely Spanish lady
Neat and sweet about the souls
Round and round goes the wheel of fortune
And where it rests now wearies me
Fair young maids are so deceiving
Sad experience teaches me
She had twenty, eighteen, sixteen, fourteen
Twelve, ten, eight, six, four, two, nine
She had nineteen, seventeen, fifteen, thirteen
Eleven, nine, seven, five, three and one
