Lift my car, I'll hog your face, prudent, or the oldest grace
That black Fitzwilliam stormed your place, drove you through the Ferdin'
Grace at victory we sure, soon the firebrand needs secure
Until he met at Kenmalure, what feek make you a-borden?
Cursed and swear, Lord Galahad, feek will do what feek will dare
How Fitzwilliam ever care, fallen as a year stare low
Up with health, but down with sword
And we're now far by the Lord
We are quick, you must give an order
Follow me up with the carlow
Be the swords, and then I'm all
Bless your lord, the English tales
See all the children of the guile
We need to board and spanner
Brewster of old Irish rock
Would you let a Saxon cock crawl out the pond
In Irish rock, you'd fly up and teach him manners
Curse and swear, Lord, to live
Fearful do I, fearful there
Half its will, you'll never care
Fall in love
Up with talk, for doubt with sword
And we're now far by the Lord
Laird MacGill has given order
Follow me up at the carload
From past our contact, Lannamore
There flows a scream of Saxon gore
Where great is Rory O'Gamore
And send them loons to Hades
Grey a stick, white a sled
Now for Blackfitt's William's head
We'll send it over, dripping red
To Queen Lysie and her ladies
it's were Lord Gulliver
Fear Gulliver, fear Gulliver
Now Fitzwilliam have a cap on and I see a star low
Up with togs, we're down with sword and we're due for by the lord
Beard like you has given the word, follow me up with the carlow
Brewster all about Irish stock
Would you let a sexton cock crow out the pawn in Irish rock
Fly up and teach him manners, pray you stick him with his lead
Now for Black Fitzwilliam's head we'll send it over dripping red
Between Lisy and her ladies
Curses were all to live
Be a builder what be a builder
Outfits will never care
Fallen as he is far and low
Up with the house board
Down with sword
And we're now far away the Lord
Very quick you has given the word
Follow me up into Carlow
A rooster of old Irish dog
Would you let a Saxon cock go out the pond
And Irish rockers fly up and teach him manners
Grey is sick, white is bled
Now for black Fitzwilliam's head
We'll send it over dripping red
Queen Lisey and her ladies
Curse and swear, Lord Calais
Fearful is what people are
Now Fitzwilliam, I care
Fallen as I used to, hello
Up with top, we're down with sword
And we're down for by the Lord
Beard McGill has given our word
Follow me up at the carload
