Tell your whole voice
Let it go boys
Bring your head around
And all together
Hail the old boys
And let the old boys
Say we go
To make a lake
What can we have?
Vitamin cheers
What can we eat for?
Windy weather
Have your whole voice
Every inch is sailing closer
To mingling
Hail, yellow boys
And let her go, boys
Bring her head'round
And all together
Oh, hail, yellow boys
And lesser go boys
Sailing home to Lingalee
Wives and sweethearts
On the hillsides
Look and see what's through the header
Oh, let's set your voice and we'll anchor
Bear the sun sets on Mingulay
Oh hail your ho boys
And let her go boys
Oh bring her head round
And all together
Oh hail your ho boys
Unlettered your voice
Say they go
To mingling
When the wind is wild
With shouting
And the waves mount ever higher
Exercise to ever see world
To see us homeboys to make a lay
Oh hail your old boys
And let her go boys
Oh bring her back round
And all together
Oh hail your old boys
And lesser gold boys
Sailing home to me and them
Hail'em, y'all old boys
And let the dough, boys
Oh, bring your head'round
And all together
Oh hail Yahweh, oh boys
Unless a dove, oh boys
Sailing home to me in Galilee
Oh sailing home to Mingalei
Oh sailing home to Mingalei
Hail Yaho boys
Hail your ho boys
Hail your ho boys
