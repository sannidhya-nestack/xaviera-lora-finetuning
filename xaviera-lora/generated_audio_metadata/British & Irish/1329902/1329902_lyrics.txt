There's a cold front rising
No politics will keep you warm
News is not surprising
Change comes like our winter storms
Since Paddy chased out the snakes
Emerald Isle follows the Trinity
Superstitions cannot break
Our belief in divinity
We fought for our religion
And our independent vision
Will proudly wear the green
And history books might try trimming
But Irish people have all seen
Their hanging men and women
For their wearing
The wearing of the green
We came back from the famine, hard times come and they will go
And Ireland must examine, which way the wind will blow
The troubles has taught us well, won't let Ireland go to hell
We'll proudly wear their green
And history books might try trimming
But Irish people have all seen
The hanging men and women
For the wearing
The wearing of the green
The wearing of the green
The wearing of the green
The wearing of the green
History books might try trimming
But Irish people have all seen
They're hanging men and women
For the wearing, the wearing of the green
