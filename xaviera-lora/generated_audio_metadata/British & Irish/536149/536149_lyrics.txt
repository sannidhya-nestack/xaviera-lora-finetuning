In a cowardly shape I drew a cape
To fly a farther field
And in my escape a dulling ache
Convincing me to yield
All day here
All day long
All day here
All day long
The powerful dust and tranquil lust
Is ready for a fight
But the glamorous red won't match
The color of my appetite
All day here
All day long
All day here
All day long
On a dangerous road
You came to hold
A fragile honesty
In a shadow it took
A healthy look
To cast a spell on me
All day here
All day long
All day here
All day long
Once upon a long time I drew a line connecting you to me
In a desperate approach I grew the hope you'd love me endlessly
All day here, all day long
All day here
All day, all day, all day, yeah
All day, all day, all day
