As I went down through Glasgow City
Far to see what I might buy
Who should I see but Nancy Whiskey
A playful twinkle in her eye
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, Whiskey, Nancy-o
I bought her, I drank her, I had another
Ran out of money, so I did steal
She ran me ragged, lovely Nancy
Seven years a rowling wheel
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
The more I held her, the more I loved her
Nancy had her spell on me
All I knew was lovely Nancy
Things I needed I could not see
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
I am out for to slight me torst
As I tried crawling off me bed
I fell down flat and I could not stagger
Nancy had me by the legs
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy-o
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy-o
A whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
I got silver in me pockets
I'll follow you wherever you go
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
The more I kissed her, the more I loved her
The more I loved her, the more she smiled
I ot me mother's warning
Nancy soon had me beguiled
Ah, whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
I saw you walk back through Glasgow City
With a heavy heart and an aching pain
So many men all courtin' Nancy
I'll never need that lass again
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy, oh
