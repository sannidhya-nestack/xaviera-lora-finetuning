When are you going out into the wild
Come take me out there boys take me out
Out to the blue lakes and mountains high
Join us now we're setting out
Today's the day that we're leaving
And it's not a moment to summon
So show me the shortest way to the mountains
Gonna go find the piece of my heart that I left there last time
If it is still to be found
We're leaving the city, it's concrete and stressed
Come take me out there boys, take me out
Can't take one more second of this filthy mess
Join us now, we're setting out
We won't miss the noise, the polluted air
Come take me out there, boys take me there
We'll be silence for music and wind in our hair
Join us now we're setting out
Today is the day that we're leaving
And it's not a moment to swim in
So show me the shortest way to the mountains
Gonna go find the piece of my heart that I left there last time
If it is still to be found
Can't stay forever, no, we will be back
Come take me out there boys, take me out
But mountains and streams will remain in our dreams
Join us now, we're setting out
I tell you today's the day that we're leaving
And it's not a moment too soon and so show me the shortest way to the mountains
Gonna go find the piece of my heart that I left there last time
If it is still to be, today's the day that we're leaving
And it's not a moment to so long, so show me the shortest way to the rockiest
Gonna go find the peace in my heart that I left there last time
If it is still to be found
