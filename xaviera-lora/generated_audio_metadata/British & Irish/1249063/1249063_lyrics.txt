Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire?
A ten thousand is each a hella hot desire
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took a little red pill
She's a sight to see, and some money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's drugged in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so fly, I have to get an airplane seat
At what cost? What's the pretty penny?
Come and get some, to hide your little treat
Turn me into a man, trust me, there are very very many
She's a little woman, don't be rich
One-top bitch, welcome to the Sataness
Oh miss money
You're fun sexy sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore miss money
Now you got a little would you like a little more miss money
Sweet little honey I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute check your roll I'll tell me if you got my tips
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some games
How can't you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous she is very very very catty
Find up the love it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough
As a swipe of a card, right to play the part
Crashing very hard in the market for a heart
Oh miss money, you're a fancy
I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person
If you're right, maybe you're a girlfriend
Maybe you're a wife
This money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but's never ever chummy
When you twinkle her green in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stock pile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just a pocket
Laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
Portfolio of hearts, I want a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss money, oh she's so dummy
Buys love but never ever show me
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
A morphine of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a decrease
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
This money, oh, the agony's not lost
Can't budget the love, it's an endless cost
Now she's made months to unlock their parts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still a sight
From the cold hard cash of the night
Oh, Miss Money, you're fancy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person
In your life, maybe your girlfriend
So here's to this money, developable, may your assets be liquid
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy, fluttering body
So here's to Miss Money
The bam of the wall, may your assets be lifted
Maybe you're the lady
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-to-do-do-do-do
Listen, she's steady on
She's a little chummy, eyes love
But it's never chummy
There's a twinkle of green in her eyes
She's a physical fairy, fluttery love
So here's to this money
The balance of gold, may your assets be
