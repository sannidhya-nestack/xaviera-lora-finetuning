Walking on these streets I think of you
All the bad things we used to do
From Grafton Street as far as Dublin Zoo
Alone in this city, me and you
Away from home, away from friends
At the windows of my flat a world ends
Sitting on the bed as shadows gather on the wall
Quiet as the footsteps in the hall
You and me together all alone
Someone's talking outside on the phone
Don't know how much longer we'll be here
But maybe once before I leave I'll shed that tear
Away from home, away from friends
At the windows of my flat a world ends
Sitting on the bed as shadows gather on the wall
Quiet as the footsteps in the hall
Walking on these streets I think of you
All the bad things I used to do
From Grafton Street as far as Dublin Zoo
Alone in this city, me and you
Away from home, away from friends
At the windows of my flat, our world ends
Sitting on the bed as shadows gather on the wall
Quiet as the footsteps in the hall
Away from home, away from friends
At the windows of my flat a world ends
Sitting on the bed as shadows gather round the wall
Quiet as the footsteps in the hall
Quiet as the footsteps in the hall
