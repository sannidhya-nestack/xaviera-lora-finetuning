I saw your light in the window
As I was passing your door
I thought I'd look in
To see how you've been
As I've done so often before
You don't look a half a day older
Sure we're all coming into our prime and now that we're here
Throw up a chair we'll make up for lost time
It's good to be back among friends again
I've been away too long
To sit by a fire like we did back then
Maybe sing a song, sing along
The children are growing like flowers
The youngest one's taller than me
It doesn't seem long since I'd sing her a song
As she danced up and down on my knee
The rambles on long summer evenings
The stir at the turn of the year, those memories remain
The welcome's the same, I'm glad to be here
It's good to be back among friends again
I've been away too long
To sit by a fire like we did back then
Maybe sing a song, sing along
A couple of places are empty
How long is it now since they've gone?
A few years ago, the night of the snow
We sat up and talked till the dawn
But no tears for the years that have vanished
There'll be plenty more dawns just as fair
The night is still young
There's songs to be sung and stories to share
It's good to be back among friends again
I've been away too long
To sit by a fire like we did back then
Maybe sing a song
It's good to be back among friends again
I've been away too long
To sit by a fire like we did back then
Maybe sing a song, sing along
Da da da da, da da da da, da da da, da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da, da da da, da da da
