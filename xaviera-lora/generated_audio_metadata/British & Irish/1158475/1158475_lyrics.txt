Trouble started long ago
Somewhere in the garden of Eden
A rattlesnake's charm she was good to go
Bring on that poison seed
Ever since the dawn of time
Nights we're fighting for the peace of mind
Nothing changed, except the year and the day
Welcome now into the seasoned army
Embry, every man for them, every man for themselves
Yes, Embry, every man for them, every man for themselves
(Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, hail the lord of the jungle
What don't kill you makes you stronger
See that smile or that Judas kiss
Put a knife in your back if the bullet missed
We all know that if we cross the line
Doing life you'll be doing thine
Nothing changed except the year and the date
Welcome now into the season of hate
Every man for them, every man for themselves
Yes every, every man for them, every man for themselves
Every, every man for them, every man for themself
Yes every, every man for them, every man for them self
How proud are you now? Look how your seeds have grown
That's right, you can't look down, nobody's home
The sun still shines on your own swill
So everybody says
You better watch, you better look out now
Don't put you in your grave
Every, every man for them, every man for themselves
Yes every, every man for them, every man for themselves
Every, every man for them, every man for themselves
Yes every, every man for them, every man for themselves
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
