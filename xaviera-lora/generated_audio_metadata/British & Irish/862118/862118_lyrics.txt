When I was barely twelve year old I left the parish school
My father feed me to the maids to chaw his milk and meal
First I put on my new upbricks to hop my spinal trams
Then I hop it round my napping knees up here in the key tams
Well, first a gade on for Biley's loon
And sign a gade on for third
And sign, of course, a hat to get the horseman's gripping ward
A loaf of bread to be my piece and a bottle for drinking drams
Ye darn again through the coffee store with the tearnicky tams
The firmer I am with the new
He's wealthy but he's mean
The corn is cheap, his horse is thin
And his harness fairly deen
He guards us, load your carts, our food
His conscience has no qualms
When we strap the rack
There's nothing like a pair of nicky tams
I'm courting Bonny Annie, noo Rob Thompson's kitschy dame
Oh she is five and forty and I'm but seventeen
She clorts a muggle beastie me with different kinds of jams
And it tells me ilk a necht that she admires my nicky tams
A Sunday morning I gied out the Kirky Forty gang
My collaret was unkotecht, my brakes were nae noor lang
I had my bible in my pooch, likewise my book of Psalms
When Nanny roars, ye mickle gate
Tak a fear na kee tams
So unka swere I took them off
The lassie farty please
But aye my bleaks they laked up a rune about my knees
And I wasped crawling up my leg in the middle o' the sands
Oh never again will I read the Kirk without my na kee tams
Now I've often thought I'd like to be a bobby on the force
Or maybe be a tramway man and drive a pair o' horse
Whatever it's my fate to be the bobby's or the tram's
I'll never et the happy days I wore my nickie tams
