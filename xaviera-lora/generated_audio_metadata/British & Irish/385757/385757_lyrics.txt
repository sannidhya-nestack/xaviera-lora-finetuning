As I went down through Glasgow City
For to see what I might spy
Who should I see but Nancy Whiskey
A playful twinkle in her eye
Whiskey Whiskey Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey Whiskey Nancy O
Whiskey Whiskey Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey Whiskey Nancy O
I bought her, I drank her, I had another
Ran out of money so I did steal
She ran me ragged, lovely Nancy
Seven years, a rolling wheel
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy Whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
The more I held her, the more I knew her
Nancy had her spell on me, yeah
All I knew was lovely Nancy
Things I needed I could not see
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
As I awoke for to slay me thirst
As I tried crawling off me bed
I fell down flat now I could not stagger
Nancy had me by the legs
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey you're awful ho
I got silver in me pockets
I'll follow you wherever you go
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
And the more I kissed her, the more I loved her
The more I loved her, the more she smiled
I ot me mammy's warning
Nancy soon had me beguiled
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy whiskey
Whiskey, whiskey, Nancy-o
I went back through Glasgow city
With a heavy heart and an aching smile
So many girls all courtin' Nancy
I'll never leave that chick a while
Whiskey whiskey Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
Whiskey whiskey it's Nancy whiskey
Whiskey whiskey Nancy oh
