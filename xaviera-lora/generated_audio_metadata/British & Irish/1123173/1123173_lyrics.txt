Tim Finnegan lived in Walkin' Street A gentleman Irish, mighty odd
He had a tongue both rich and sweet And to rise in the world he carried a haught
Now Tim had a sort of a tippling way
With a love of the liquor for Tim was born
And to help him on his way each day
He'd a drop of the crater every morning
Whack for the doll now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, you trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you?
Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake
His friends assembled at the wake
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch (Lunch!)
First they brought in tea and cakes
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch
Then pity O'Brien began to cry
Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?
"I robbed him of orn and why did you die?"
"I'll hold your tongue," says Patty McGee
Whacked full of doll now dance to your partner
Welt the floor you try to shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you?
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the moan
"Oh, Bitty says she, you're wrong, I'm sure"
Then Bitty gave her a belt in the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor
'Twas then a mighty war did rage
woman to woman and man to man
Shillelagh did all engage
And a row and a ruction soon began
Whack for the doll now, dance to your partners
Whelp the floor, you trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake
Then Mickey Maloney ducked his head
When a nog and a whiskey flew at him
It missed him landing on the bed
The liquor splattered over Tim
Be dead, he revives, see how he rises
Timothy rising from the bed
Says, "Sling your whiskey round like blazes"
"Tana, my doll, do you think I'm dead?"
Whack for the doll, now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, you trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you?
Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake
Whack for the doll, now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, you trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake!
Wasn't it the truth I told you? Lots of fun at Finnegan's Wake!
