Come by the hills to a land where fancy is free
And stand where the peaks meet the sky
And the locks greet the sea
Where the river's running clear
And the bracken is called in the sun
Where the cares of tomorrow can wait
Until this day is done
Come by the hills to a land where life is a song
And sing while the birds fill the air
With their joy all day long
Where the trees sway in time
And even the wind knows the tune
Where the cares of tomorrow can wait
Until this day is done
Come by the hills to a land where legend remains
Where stories of old fill the heart and may it come again
Where the past has been lost and the future still has to be won
Where the cares of tomorrow can wait until this day is done
