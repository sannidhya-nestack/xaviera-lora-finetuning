In the merry month of May from my home I started
Left the girls of Torm nearly broken hearted
Sleuted father dear, kiss me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, my grief and tears to smother
Then off to rape the cod, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts
And gobbled in brand new pair of brogs
Rattled all the bogs, frightened all the dogs
And the rock was gone
To Dublin, one, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack for Laldida
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight, next morning light and air
He took a drop of pure to keep my heart from sinking
That's a fine man's cure when air is on for drinking
See the lassie smile, laughing all the while
Hep Markera's style to set your heart a-bubbling
Asked if I was hard, the wages I required
Until I was tired of the rocky road to Dublin
One, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down a rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack for lolly dah
In Dublin next arrived, thought it's such a pity
To be soon deprived of view of that fine city
Then I took a stroll, all among the quality bundle it was stole
In a neat locality something crossed my mind
Then I looked behind, no bundle could I find
Upon my stick a wobbling asking for the rogue
Said my conic brogue was a marching bug
On the rocky road to Dublin
One, two, three, four, five hundred
And turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack for Laldi da
From there I got away, my spirits never failing
Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing
Captain had me roared, said no room had he
When I jumped on board, cabin found for Paddy
Then down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, walked around me
Bubbling off the holly head, I wish myself was dead
Better far instead on the rock
To Dublin, one, two, three, four, five
Hunt the bear and turn her down a rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack for laldy dah
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called myself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle, they began abusing
Hurry up, my soul, shalaley, let it fly
Some Galway boys were by, sore I was a-hobbling
With a loud hooray, joined in the fray
Quickly cleared the way for the Rock
One, two, three, four, five, hunt the hare and turn her down a rocky road
And all the way to Dublin whack for Laudy Duh!
One, two, three, four, five, hunt the hare and turn her down a rocky road
And all the way to Dublin whack for Lauday Duh!
