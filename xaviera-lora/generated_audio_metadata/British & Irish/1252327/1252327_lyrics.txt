Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a calm brick shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and pine
Without no seeds nor needlework
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(Such a crazy and posh isn't funny)
Then she'll be a true lover of mine
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(The girls went and spoke the talk)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(If for cause they fall in love)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and pine
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
