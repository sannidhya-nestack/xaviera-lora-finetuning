Believe me, it follows endearing young charms
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms
Like fairy gifts fading away
Thou would still be adored as this moment ours
Let thy loveliness fade as it will
And around the dear ruin
Each wish of my heart
Would entwine itself fairly still
It is not one beauty and youth that I know
And I cheek some profane by fear
That the fair apparent face of a soul can be known
To which time would but make thee more dear
No, the heart that has truly loved never ets
But has truly loved on to the close
As the sunflower turns on her God when he sets
The same look which she turned when he rose
