G e Monk was born a leader of men
Who swore to serve his king to the end
Though even before Charlie's head hit the floor
G e was knocking at Fairfax's door
With glory there comes booty
For the love of a fair day's pay
If your troops took a mound he'd lend you a hand
G e Monk was a practical man
When the Second War came, G e Monk found fame from Ireland to Dunbar
Leading Cromwell's men as adviser and friend, soon G e was a general again
With glory there comes booty, for the love of a fair day's pay
If your troops took command, he'd lend you a hand, General Monk was a practical man
The fleet set sail under Admiral Monk and to fight Van Tromp did go
Although he didn't know his port from his bow G e still made a profitable show
With glory there comes booty for the love of a fair day's pay
If your ship's to command he'd lend you a hand, Admiral Monk was a practical man
The protector died and from Richard's side
General Monk saw they were through
He didn't lose any sleep with estates to upkeep
What else could poor G e do?
General Monk proclaimed Prince Charles as King
And his troops controlled the town
With the monarchy restored and a peerage assured
Loyal men earned rich rewards
With glory there comes booty
For the love of a fair day's pay
If your troops to command he'd lend you a hand
G e Monk was a practical man
General Monk was a practical man
Lord Monk was a practical man
