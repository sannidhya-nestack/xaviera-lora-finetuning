In a neat little town they call Belfast
Apprenticed to trade I was bound
And its many an hour of sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
Till a sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and relations
To follow the black velvet band
And her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
As I was out strolling one evening
Not meaning to go very far
I met with this fickle some damsel
Who was selling her trade at the bar
When I watched that she took from a customer
And slipped it right into my hands
And the law came and put me in prison
Bad luck to her black velvet band
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
It thinks she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
Next morning before judge and jury
For trial I had to appear
And the judge, he said, "My young fellow
The case against you is quite clear
So it's seven long years' transportation
You're going to Van Diemen's land
Far away from your friends and relations
To follow the black velvet band
And her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
So come all my sporting young fellows
Come and take warning with me
And the next time you're out on the liquor mill, lads
Beware of your pretty Colleen
For she'll fill you with whiskey and porter
Till you are unable to stand
And the very next thing that you know me, boys
You've landed in Van Diemen's land
And her eyes, they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
Yes, her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
Yes, her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band
