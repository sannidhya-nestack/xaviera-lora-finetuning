I'm glad it was you and not somebody else
That I met when I walked in the door
It seems like an age since I stepped on this stage
And I thought I would see you no more
But it's easy with hindsight to know where to turn right
It really just happens in dreams
But we were young, so young then
When nothing is quite what it seems
Yes, we were young, so young then
When nothing is quite what it seems
So what are you doing and where have you been
Since we both felt the need to be free
Did the job that you talked about ever quite work out
Or had you to travel like me
Well you know just how hard it was breaking my heart
It was just to see blue in the sky
But we were young, so young then
Finding it hard to get by
Yes we were young, so young then
Finding it hard to get by
Now after all this time I'm back here again
Not much further than where I began
A little bit older and maybe the wiser
Still doing much less than I can
But who counts the worthwhiles or measures
A girl smiling who puts a value on dreams
For we were young, so young then
When nothing is quite what it seems
Yes, we were young, so young then
When nothing is quite what it seems
