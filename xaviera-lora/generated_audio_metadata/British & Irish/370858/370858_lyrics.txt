Another day breaks and the dawn sheds light on the land
Yet here I stand in shadows, the weapon of death in my hand
A man must go to his grave
In the fight to make this land free
A soul must depart from this earth
Its tormentor is me
For they told me we fought for the people
They said our intentions were right
Yet why does my heart find no peace
In the dark of the night?
It's then the demons come back to haunt me
For all the dark deeds
There must be a far better way than the bullet and gun
For ten long years I have fought
And redemption I've yet to find
How it's a war that's for certain
But the battle is fought in my mind
I'm fighting for freedom
Now I know I will only be free
When these eyes so blinded by hate
One day truly see
That they tore me, we fought for the people
They said our intentions were right
Ah, but why does my heart find no peace
In the dark of the night
Ah, the demons come back to haunt me
Ah, for all the dark deeds I have done
Ah, there must be a far better way
Than the bullet and gun
Ah, the demons come back to haunt me
Ah, for all the dark deeds I have done
There must be a far better way than the bullet and gun
Lord there must be a far better way than the bullet and gun
