La la la la la la la la la la la la
The snow keeps on falling
Let's have one more glass of wine
There's a new year in the morning
So drink up and have a good time
Let's drink to the old ones before us
And the young who are finding their way
Tonight is almost tomorrow
And tomorrow will be a new day
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
Through trials and tribulations
The laughter, the hopes and the tears
The morning will be our salvation
The first day of a brand new year
Let's drink to the old ones before us
And the young who are finding their way
Tonight is almost tomorrow
And tomorrow will be a new day
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
One more year is passing
Say goodbye with laughter and wine
Tonight is music and dancing
Let's hope there will be a next time
Let's drink to the old ones before us
And the young
Who are finding their way
Tonight is almost tomorrow
And tomorrow will be a new day
Let's drink to the old ones before us
And the young who are finding their way
Tonight is almost tomorrow
And tomorrow will be a new day
