Now I'm coming close to 42
Some folks don't like this, some do
Me, I'm happy if I've got you
You are my spirit and I'm never blue
Some folks have been through the mill, some have not
Some take life easy, no matter what
Me, I'm halfway down the line
It's hard to be easy without a cup of wine
Yeah, now I'm coming close to forty-two
Some folks don't like this, some do
Me, I'm happy if I've got you
You are my spirit and I'm never able to live
Oh, I don't know what's on the road ahead
Nobody knows but I'm easily led
Tell me what you want then I'll say yes that's true
Yes I'm naive and yes I'm 42
Flowers in the grass, warmth in the rain
I'll be seeing you here again
You are my spirit and I am your slave
Stay with me baby, let's try to be brave
Yeah, now I'm coming close to 42
Some folks don't like this number, some do
Me, I'm happy if I've got you
you are my spirit and I'm never blue
I'll try to be nice to you, oh 42
It ain't so bad, just a number, what's new?
Love is the answer, ain't we heard that before?
Don't matter if you're a saint or a whore
I'll now I'm coming close to 42
Some folks don't like this, some do
Me, I'm happy if I've got you
You are my spirit and I'm never blue
Yeah, you are my spirit and I'm never blue
