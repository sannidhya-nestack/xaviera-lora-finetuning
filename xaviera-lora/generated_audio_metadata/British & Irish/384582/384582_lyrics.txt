Oh the summer time has come
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather
Will you go, Lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain time
All around the purple heather
Will you go, Lassie, go?
I will build my love a tower
By unclear crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To poor wild mountain time
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, go?
I will range through the wilds
To the deep land oh so dreary
And return with the spoils
To the bower of my dairy
Will you go, lassie, go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain time
All around the purple heather
William Gold, Lassie Gold
If my true love shall not come
Then I'll surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, go
And we'll all go together to pull wild mountain time
All around the purple heather, will you go lassie go?
