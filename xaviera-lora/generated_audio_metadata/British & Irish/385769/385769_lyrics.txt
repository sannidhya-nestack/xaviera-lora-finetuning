In the year of our lord, eighteen hundred and six
We set sail for the sweet town of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
From the grand city hall in New York
We had an elegant craft, she was rigged for a naft
And oh how the trade winds blew over her
She had eighteen iron sails and withstood many gales
And they called her the Irish Rover
We had one million bags
At a best like our eggs we had two million barrels of bone
We had three million sites of old blind horses hides
We had four million baskets of stone
We had five million hobs, six million doves
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bales of old nanny goats tails in the hoe
In the Irish Rover
There was old Grandad Kilt, who blew hard on his flute
When the ladies lined up for a set
He would tumble with still, free sparkling quadril
Till the dancers were flutered in bets
He was smart with his talk, he was cock of the walk
As he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew by a glance
When he took up his stance that he sailed in the Irish Rover
There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was L .G .McGurk
I was so scared of work and your man from Westmead come along
I was the girl too, I was drunk as a fool
And big old gay elder bending over
And your man Sean McCann from the banks of the Bayou was the skipper
In the Irish Rover
When we sailed out to sea back in 1803
You could see that we hadn't a chance
For the chef old Dick Stout without a hint of a doubt
Made the soup out of old underpants
He tossed up this old grill, oh good lord it was cruel
It was a thing you would never get over
For the pains they would come, then it'd be a great run for the jacks
In the Irish Rover
We had sailed seven years
When the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
Then the haul of the crew
Was reduced down to two
Just me self and the captain's old dog
And then the ship struck a rock
Oh lord what a shock
It went up down and around
But not over
She's spun seven times around
And the poor old dog was drowned
I'm the last in the Irish Rover
