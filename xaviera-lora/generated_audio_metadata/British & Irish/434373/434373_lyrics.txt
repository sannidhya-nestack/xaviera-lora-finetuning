And you I love
And you will rise above
All the pain I made you feel so real
The wounds will heal
One day, one day
And your heart stood still
As you watched my will
Take us down that highland road
So cold we'll find our way
Someday, someday
And we will share
Separate breaths of air
I will find a mountain trail you'll sail to see
You'll see, you'll see, you'll see
And the sun shines in, a new day begins
Can we find a place, a warm embrace from yesterday?
Yesterday, yesterday
Because you I love
And you will rise above
All the pain I made you feel so real
Our hearts will heal one day
One day
One day
Because you are love
