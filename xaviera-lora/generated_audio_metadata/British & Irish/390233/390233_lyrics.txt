Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a ship that might go down sweet and sound
Love flirts with your fate when it comes to you too late
It's the blood on the knife of your tormented world
In the clouds you dreamed of the loves that you had
It's a gun that you fired at the mother who always sees her
Like sand in the hourglass
Your goodness got smashed
You write lovers who endlessly fought
Salvation but love
A desire that's broken
Down from above
Is a narrow road that you're on
And the peace that came after the tear
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
Love is a symphony, love is a clown
