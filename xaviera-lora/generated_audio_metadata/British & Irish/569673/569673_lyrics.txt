Requiem et anam, donna eis Dom
Et respet, laudat, et adeus (Requiem et anam)
Rest your tender face, child
Let the sunshine fill your face
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (La, la, la, la, la, la)
(Return of darkness) (Return of darkness) (Return of darkness) (Return of darkness)
And it's great to know that we're meant to be
And we're meant to find a way to go our own way
And we're meant to find a way to stay
