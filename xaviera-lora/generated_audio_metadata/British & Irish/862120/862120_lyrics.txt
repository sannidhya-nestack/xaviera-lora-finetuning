This is nae a sang o love, nor yet a sang o money
Faith it's nae than very pitiful, it's nae than very funny
But there's eel and scotch, lool and scotch, butter and scotch and honey
If there's nae nae of them far o, there's a mix tae ro the three
And there's nae a word o beef, bro's sound so deep
Anaks no nor pancakes
Peas, eggs for them with dainty stomachs
But it's all about a meal in ale that happened at Balmorax
I'm a guinty's meal in Dale for the pig ate on the spree
For they were howling in the kitchen like a carnival at Inky's Eye
Some were playing ping pong, diddly-widdly-winkies
For up the how and down the how you never saw such inkies at the guinty's meal in Dale
For the piggy don't miss me
Noo McGinty's pig had broken loose
And run out through the lobby
For he opened, shoved a pantry door
Come upon the toddy
Aye, and he took kindly to the stuff
Like on a human buddy
At McGinty's meal and dail
For the pig ate on the spree
Noo Miss McGinty's sheer and ben the hoose
The wife was dark and crooked
She'd get heels to her gowdy
Or the pig for it she'd never look at
And then she let out a skirrel that would hae paralysed a chuket at my genty's me lindale for the pig ate on the spree
Now Johnny Murphy, he ran after her, and o'er the pig was leapin'
When he trumpeted in a shit that was sittin' food-rippin'
And then he fell down and he peeled his croon and he couldn't
He had fae greetin' at McGinty's Meelindale, for the pig gave him the spree
Now the pantry shelf came rickling down and he was lying kerning
Among soft soap, peas, meal, corn flour and yer man
Like a golloch among trickle but McKinty's wife was gurning
At the sauce upon our pantry flare, wouldn't I let him be
For they were howling in the kitchen like a caravan of tinkeys aye
Some were playing ping pong, diddly-widdley-winkies
Far up the howl, down the howl, you never saw such jinkies
At McGinty's, Meelandale, or the Piggate on the Spree
Now they all come running to the door and when the tit was tugget
Aye it held the faster, aye they merely rugged
Till my ginty roared bring an axe, I wouldn't be humbugget
No, nor locket in my in-house that I let them see
So his wife came trailing with an axe and when the door was hacket
Aye, open flew the door at yintzee techt as they were packet
That o' the crook of Rumble and Oot, like Chatties Fae a bucket
At McGinty's Meal and Dale for the pig eat on the spree
For they had spurtles, they had tatty choppers, faith they weren't a-joking
And they swore they'd gar the pig claw where it was never yoking
But by this time the pig was full and didn't he care a-joking
At McGinty's Meal and Dale for the pig ate on the spree
Now there's eely pigs, jeely pigs, pigs for hawd and butter
Aye but this pig was rolling foo, rowing in the gutter
Till McGinty and his foreman whicht him oot upon a shutter
Fae McGinty's me lindale for the pig he'd on the spree
For they were howling in the kitchen like a caravan at Inky's Eye
Some were playing ping pong, tiddly-widdly-winkies
Far up the how, down the how, you never saw such jinkies at
McGinty's, Meal and Dale, or the pig gate on the Spree
Now Miss McGinty took the thing to heart
Hide it in a closet and they rub it
Johnny Murphy's heed we turpentine and rosette
Sign they harrowed him we meal and ale
You really would suppose it
But he'd sleep it in the mason's trough
And risen to this view
Now it's weary on the barley-bree, and weary for the weather aye
Keacher and mung-dubs and drink the gang, they wheel the giver
But without a doot, McGinty's pig is wishing for another
Oh McGinty's wheeling dale, for the pig ate on the spree
For it's howling in the kitchen like a caravan of tinkeys
Some were playing ping pong, tiddly-widdly-winkies
Far up the how, down the how, you never saw so shinkies at McGinty's Meal and Dale
For the pig ate on the spree
