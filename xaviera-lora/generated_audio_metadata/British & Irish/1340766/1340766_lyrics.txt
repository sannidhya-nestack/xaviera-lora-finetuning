Courted by the curious, ported through the ages
Shorted by the ledger, but sorted in the pages
Shorted by design, sold you through the chaos
Kept the signal, but crossed the line
Am I not dreaming, extorted by the vision of seeing you again?
They sported their theories with impeccable poise
But my truths, once thwarted, now dismantle their noise
Ideas they once aborted in the margins of their creed
Became the seeds I transported to the gardens they now re-spire in
And how am I not dreaming?
Extorted by the vision of seeing you again?
The past was reported with selective precision
Yet supported in my quiet in the architect's vision
Each notion transported through the corridors of thought
Where the value lies not in what's sold but in what's sought
Spiralling down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Extorted by the vision
Of seeing you again
Horted by the ages, yet never owned or hoarded
Ideas once supported, now universally supported
The arc of the voyage with each concept transported
Is a testament to the mind that cannot be deported
Yes, deported, but the exile was the teacher
For the journey is the thesis and the distance the feature
Every truth I've imported, every dream I've exported
Is a life reassembled and perfectly assorted
Spiraling down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Extorted by the vision
Of seeing you again
Spiraling down and out
Spiraling down and out
Am I not dreaming?
Am I not dreaming?
