Near to Bambridgetown in the county town
On a morning in July
Down a boring green came a sweet Colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by
Oh she looked so neat from her two white feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf I had to shake myself
To make sure I was really there
Oh, from Banshree Bay up to Derry Cay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the sweet Colleen
That I met in the county town
As she onwards sped, I scratched my head
And I gazed with a feeling queer
There I said, says I, to our passer-by
Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair
Oh, he smiled at me and with pride says he
That's the gem of Ireland's crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the band
She's the star of the County Down
Oh from Bantry Bay up to Derry Cay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the sweet Colleen
That I met in the County Down
At the harvest fair, she'll surely be there
So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
And I'll try sheep's eyes and a Lutheran lies
On the heart of the nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Though my plough with rust turn brown
a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits a star of the county down
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Cay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the sweet Colleen
That I met in the county down
Oh from Bantry Bay up to Derry Cay
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the sweet Colleen
That I met in the county down
