We've built us a city of couches and stools And we've filled it with drink and with song
We wrestle with muscle, we wrestle with wit But in secret we all get along
We've opened our doors to the wandering soul To the young men with no place to hide
We come and we go, every man on the prowl
But we always return to the pride
We are a house of broken hearts
We are a brotherhood of the damned
We've given our souls and we've nothing to show
So we drink to the troubles of man
Now many a lady have us entertained
We've opened our hearts and our beds
We're all good gentlemen, honest and true
But that many a harlot have fled
So we take to the bottle that pours bitter sweet
Never mind if it's right or it's wrong
So raise up your glasses, now bottoms up boys
Let us drink, let us all sing along
We are a house of broken hearts
We are a brotherhood of the damned
We've given our souls and we've nothing to show
So we drink to the troubles of man
We fought the good fight for the good lord above
We could tell of the deeds we have done
We faced the temptations that preyed on our youth
We challenged the devil and won
But beyond the good marks and the triumphs of will
Is a treasure more precious than life
And for all of our pining we stand at a loss
For a lover, a lady, a wife
We are a house of broken hearts
We are a brotherhood of the damned
We've given our souls and we've nothing to show
So we drink to the troubles of man
We are a house of broken hearts
We've given our souls and we've nothing to show
We've tried and survived but we're bruised to the bone
Though many among us, we're each man alone
So we drink to the troubles of man
