(Gosh, it's just so crazy)
The river breathes so sweetly through the snowy days
The moon in the night looks so fair
The ocean is calling me home
Stream of emotions is calling me home
This is the end of the story, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done, I am done
I am home
