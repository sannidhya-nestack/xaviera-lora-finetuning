In Bainbridge town in the county down one morning last July
From a boring green came a sweet Karlene and she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet to the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf sure I shook myself for to see I was really there
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Cay and from Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the fair Colleen that I met at the County Down
As she onward sped sure I scratched my head with a look and a feeling rare
And I said said aye to a passerby who's the maid with the nut brown hair
He smiled at me and he said said he that's the gem of Ireland's crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the band
She's the star of the County Down
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Cave
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the fair Colleen
That I met at the County Down
At the harvest fair, surely she'll be there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shown bright and my hat cocked right
For a smile from a nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plow runs rust colored brown
Till the smiling bride by me own fireside
Sits the star of the county down
From Bantry Bay up to Derricay and from Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the fair Colleen that I met at the County Down
From Bantry Bay up to Derricay and from Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the fair Colleen
That I met at the County Down
