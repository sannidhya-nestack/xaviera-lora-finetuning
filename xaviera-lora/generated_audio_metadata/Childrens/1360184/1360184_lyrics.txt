Hey there, buddy, buddy, gather'round the gate
It's someone's birthday, we just can't wait
Bouncing balls and bags of fun
Rolling ribbons for everyone
Five friends laughing in the yard so why?
Jumping, shining side by side
Pick up your party hat, hold it tight
Ready for it, get the let's do this, right!
Clap, plug your hands, stomp, stomp your feet
Swing around the backyard, skip to the beat
Swing, sing, shout hooray
It's a backyard birthday today
Hide behind the hedges, count to ten
Search for sprinkles again and again
Snack attack with apple treats
Tumbling towers, silly seeds
Flag waving, cake craving
Eyes open wide, chasing sunshine
We just can't hide
Tie up your shoelace, smooth and neat
Ready for relay races down the street
Clap, clap, clap your hands, stomp, stomp your feet
Swing seat, shop away, it's a backyard birthday today
Circle of high fives around, singing out loud, silly sound
Five voices blending me, harmony
You're my best buddy with me
Clap again, stomp, stomp your feet
Swing into the beat, swing, sing
Shout hooray, it's like your birthday day
Jump, laugh and shout hooray, it's like your birthday to me
