Here's a silly song you can sing along
Silly, silly, silly, silly, silly
It doesn't mean a thing, it's easy to sing
Da-da-dilly, silly, da-da-bing
Silly, billy, silly, willy, silly all day long
Silly like a monkey talking on the phone
Silly Sam, silly Pam, silly beans and ham
I love being silly, that's who I am
I like saying silly, it tickles my tongue
They say being silly keeps you young
Silly, silly, silly, silly, silly
It's easy to sing
Silly billy, silly willy, silly all day long (hey)
Silly like a monkey talking on the phone (woof woof)
Silly sam, silly clam, sippy's and ham
I love being silly, that's who I am
Silly makes me smile, it'll make you laugh
When I'm being silly, the day goes by so fast
Silly, silly, silly, silly, silly
Everybody sees
Silly Billy, silly Willy, silly all day long
Silly like a monkey talking on the phone
Silly Sam, silly Clam, silly Beans and Ham
I love being silly, that's who I am
Mom and dad said don't be silly, it will stunt your growth
But I can't stop the sillies, I took an oath
To be silly, silly, silly, silly, silly
It's easy to sing
Silly Billy silly Winnie silly all day long (hey)
Silly like a monkey talking on the phone (hey girl)
Silly Sam silly Pam sippies and ham
I love being silly that's who I am
It's time for me to go
I hope that you had fun
A little bit of silliness never hurt no one
Silly
Silly, silly, silly, silly
Everybody see
Silly, bitty, silly, really silly, oh they gone
Silly like a monkey talking on the phone
Silly Sam, silly Pam, silly Beats and Ham
I love being silly and I love everyone
