Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
When the bow breaks the cradle will fall
Down will come baby cradle and all
Baby is drowsing, cosy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps he hears what she sings
Rock-a-bye baby, do not you fear
Never mind baby, mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now to sleep until morning light
Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
When the bow breaks the cradle will fall
Down will come baby cradle and all
Baby is drowsing, cosy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings
Rock-a-bye baby, do not you fear
Never mind baby, mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now to sleep until morning light
