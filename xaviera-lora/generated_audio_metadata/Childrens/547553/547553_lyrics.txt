Five little leaves so bright and gay
Hung on a tree one nice fall day
The wind came blowing round and round
And one little leaf came tumbling down
Four little leaves so bright and gay
Hung on a tree one nice fall day
The wind came blowing round and round
And one little leaf came tumbling down
Three little leaves so bright and gay
Hung on a tree one nice fall day
The wind came blowing round and round
And one little leaf came tumbling down
Two little leaves so bright and gay
Hung on a tree one nice fall day
The wind came blowing round and round
And one little leaf came tumbling down
One little leaf so bright and gay
Hung on a tree one nice fall day
The wind came blowing round and round
The one little leaf came tumbling down
The one little leaf came tumbling down
