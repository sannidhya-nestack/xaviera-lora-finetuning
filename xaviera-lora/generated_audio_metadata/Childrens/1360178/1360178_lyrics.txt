A rain splish, splashing on the floor
Boots jumping by the door
Five friends, laughter galore
Puddle stomps, silly encore
Rainy day parade
Wiggling, giggling down the lane
Umbrellas high hooray
March with us, let's play (let's play)
Wind is whistling, hats take flight
Colors twirling, what a sight
Skip hop shimmies left and right
Soggy socks, curta light
Rainy day parade
Wiggling, giggling down the lane
Umbrellas high hooray
March with us, let's play (let's play)
Jump in puddles, big splashes now
Spin your umbrella, take a bow
Laugh so hard, et the cloud
Join the fun and sing out loud
And sing out loud
Rainy day parade
Wiggling, giggling down the lane
Umbrellas high, hooray
March with us, let's play
Raindrops dance, though we won't hide
With every friend here by our side
Move your feet, let joy be your guide
Rainy day parade
Let's ride
