And learn to teach
So I guess I'll let you go, but I won't
So long, I'm gonna spit you out
Hey friend, look outside
There's a giggle walking by
I see fun and happy faces
Waving as they dance in line
The sunshine's calling, come along
Oh yes, we can!
Just one more moment, not too long
Everybody clap your hands
We'll bounce, bounce, bouncing back soon
Jumping feet on the way to you
Bounce, bounce, bouncing back soon
Can you feel it? Oh! Sing it too! Hey!
Balloons float up and laughter rings
Someone's saving a spot for you
Counting down with every swing
Ready or not, peek-a-boo!
A hop, a skip, a silly cheer
Team up close so glad you're near
Just outside the window pane
We'll be together once again
Bounce, bounce, bounce back soon
Jump, feet on the way to you
Bounce, bounce, bounce with that suit and you'll feel it
Oh, tell me to, hey!
Grab that suit, sound, get those sounds!
Bounce, bounce, bouncing back soon
Drunky feet on the way to you
Bounce, bounce, bouncing back soon
Take the silliest sound (oh)
Everybody jumps around
So bounce, bounce, bouncing back soon
We'll be together really soon
