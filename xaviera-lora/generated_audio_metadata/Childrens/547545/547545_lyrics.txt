My name is Samuel the Steam Engine
I miss the good old days
Sure there were times I was so busy
I would almost collapse from exhaustion
But I was made for hard work
You see, I was born before there were cars or planes
So when people wanted to get somewhere
They used me
Winter, summer, spring and fall
I linked up my cars every day of the year
And off I went
Round by the station early in the morning
See the locomotive, the steam is blowing high
The coaches link together, no matter what the weather
Chug, chug, toot, toot, it's coming by
As I grow older people use me less and less
My grandchildren, the diesel and electric trains
Have taken over most of my workload
They joke and say that I'm old fashioned
They think that soon I'll become extinct
Like the dinosaurs
But I know better
I can still blow off a great cloud of steam with pride and joy
Down by the station, early in the morning
The train is finally going, the wheels begin to turn
The steam gets even higher as coal goes on the fire
Ding ding, chug chug, watch it burn
I tell my grandchildren, it's not how old or young you are that matters
It's the joy you bring to others
And I bet that a hundred years from now as I pull back into the station
I'll still be making people smile like nothing else
Back by the station later in the morning
Train is slowing down'cause the journey's almost done
The passengers step down now they're going into town now
Toot toot ding ding that was fun
That was fun
