(dog barking)
Got a date with Fifi, we are all too proud
Climb up on the back porch and let out with a howl
Knock over trash cans, chew up some old shoes
Dig up the neighbor's yard and plant a bone or two
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
(dog barking)
Yeah, sometimes I get frisky and drink from toilet bowls
Knock over tables, that's when my owner scolds
I just get real sorry, get a sad look on my jaws
I got'em where I want'em, in the palm of my paws
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
I like chasing otters, I like chasing cats
I like chasing mailmans and sticks and balls and hats
My hair is on the sofa, yeah my hair is on the bed
The only place my hair is not is on old grandpa's head
Oh, ho, ho, the adventures of a dog
Sure my life is simple, I live without a care
Except when I get careless in Scratchpop's favorite chair
Some folks say we're stupid, that we're too dumb to be pets
But we're not paying for our food or healthcare at the vet's
Oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
Oh, oh, oh, the adventures of a dog
Ho, ho, ho, Ventures of a Dogga
Ho, ho, ho, Ventures of a Dogga
