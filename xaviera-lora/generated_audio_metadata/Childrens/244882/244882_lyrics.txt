I fly around while most people sleep
Hang upside down in a cave
And though I probably give you the creeps
It doesn't have to be that way
I got a itty-bitty body
To match my itty-bitty name
My soft fur is grey or brown
I got wings to help me soar through the sky
Many feet above the ground
Got many brothers and sisters, cousins and relatives
Over one thousand varieties, all around the world we live
We got strange looking faces, strange looking ears
Our noses can be short or long
We've got claws that can be used as hooks
When we feel like holding on
If you think I'm a bird, that's absurd
I don't look anything like that
And in case you haven't heard
I'm not a gnat
Or am I a rat?
You can call me a bat
We live happily together
In our roosts we huddle each day
When the sun sets we open our eyes
It's time to come out to play
Don't be alarmed, I mean you no harm
You really have nothing to fear
When it comes to those scary tales
You can't believe all that you hear
If you think I'm a bird, that's absurd
I don't look anything like that
And in case you haven't heard
I'm not a gnat, nor am I a rat
You can call me a bat
If you think I'm a bird, that's absurd
I don't look anything like that
And in case you haven't heard
I'm not a gnat, nor am I a prat
You can call me a bat
You can call me a bat
You can call me a bat
