A band of angels filled my room, brighter than a thousand moons
They played a song of joy for me, a song of sky and earth and sea
Notes of blue, pink, gold and green, leapt from horns and tambourines
Fluttered up from silver flutes, skipped across a golden lute
Dance door harps and mandolins, swirl above a violin
Joy by joy they filled my room
Brighter than a thousand moons
Filled the sky and earth and sea
Echoed through the galaxy
Then drifted off to who knows where
A bright and ringing angel's prayer
Then drifted off to who knows where
A bright and ringing angel's prayer
