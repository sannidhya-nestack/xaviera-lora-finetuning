Sharp-toothed Tyrannosaurus rex
His favorite food is Tex-Mex
Some people say that he's a pest
Sharp-toothed Tyrannosaurus rex
He bites all the other dinosaurs
With a chomp he swallows them
And then he takes a three hour nap
And starts all over again

His favorite food is Tex-Mex
Some people say that he's a pest
Shark tooth Tyrannosaurus Rex
A paradactyl has two wings
Triceratops has three horns
But neither of them is half as mean
As the king of the dinosaurs
Sharp-toothed Tyrannosaurus Rex
His favorite food is Tex-Mex
Some people say that he's a pest
Sharp-toothed Tyrannosaurus Rex
He used to roam across the earth
Millions of years ago
But now the only thing that's left
Is a bunch of old dry bones, whoa!

His favorite food is Tex-Mex
Some people say that he's a pest
