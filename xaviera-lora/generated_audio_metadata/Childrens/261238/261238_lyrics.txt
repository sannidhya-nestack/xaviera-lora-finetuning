Bingy and bangy and bongy and boo
Were elephants living in the city zoo
They thought they would like to go on a trip
So they packed their trunks and got on a ship
Do the elephant dance
Wave your trunk in the air
Do the elephant dance
You can't have any cares
Do the elephant dance
Gonna party'til we're done
Yeah, really shouldn't worry
We're not in any hurry
Just trying to have some fun
Simba and Samba were proud of their manes
Two hungry lions on the African plains
Got tired of eating raw meat and liver
So they ordered a pizza and had it delivered
Do the lion dance
Scratch your claws in the air
Do the lion dance
You can't have any cares
Do the lion dance
I'm gonna party'til we're done
You really shouldn't worry
We're not in any hurry
I'm just trying to have us some fun
Ted was a toothy Tyrannosaurus Rex
Happy to munch on other dinosaurs' necks
A friend dropped by, it would be nice to meet her
But he changed his mind and decided to eat her
Do the dinosaur dance
Snap your teeth in the air
Do the dinosaur dance
You can't have any cares
Do the dinosaur dance
Gonna party'til we're done
You really shouldn't worry
We're not in any hurry
Just trying to have us some fun
Skeeter and Scooter didn't know what to want
They were dung beetles eating in a restaurant
Skeeter said, "Waiter, there's a fly in my soup"
Scooter said, "Whoa, there's a fly in my poop"
Do the dung beetle dance
Roll that poop on the ground
Do the dung beetle dance
Roll it all around
Do the dung beetle dance
Gonna party'til we're done
You really shouldn't worry
We're not in any hurry
Just trying to have us some fun
You really shouldn't worry
We're not in any hurry
Just trying to have us some fun
