I've got ten of the craziest grandchildren you ever saw
I wrote'em a little song I'm gonna sing
There were ten in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and one fell out
There were nine in the bed and the little one said roll over roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were eight in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were seven in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were six in the bed and the little one said roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were five in the bed and the little one said roll over roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were four in the bed and the little one said roll over roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There was three in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There were two in the bed and the little one said
Roll over, roll over
And they all rolled over and the one fell out
There was one in the bed and the little one said I'm sorry I'm lonely
So they climbed in bed and the little one said good night
