A Coast Guard was naughty and greedy too
A Seagull did poop and a Rufus did chew
Bets gave him a push, Hillary dug in a claw
The traitor got all, he was Jew and some more
he grabbed back down and he threw up his arms
He said he was sorry, no one fell for his charms
The pirates joined up to condemn him so
He'll stay here behind while the rest of us go
The treasure is won, the trader has lost
The treasure is won, he's paying the cost
We've got coming out of our ears
We're rich, so rich, we'll be rich for the rest of our years
The trader is left there to fend for himself
He'll have to make do without treasure for wealth
Our crew is so pleased Captain Bligh is alive
And the bosun gives Roger a happy high five
The treasure is won, the trader has run
The treasure is won, we're having some fun
We've got coming out of our east
We're rich, so rich, we'll be rich for the rest of our years
Our captain kneels down, gives Rowena a ring
Rowena's so happy she
And this is for sure what it's going to be
The treasure is won, the traitor has failed
The treasure is won, his last ship has sailed
We've got coming our worries
We're rich, so rich we'll be rich
For the rest of our years
The rest of our years
The rest of our years
The rest of our years
