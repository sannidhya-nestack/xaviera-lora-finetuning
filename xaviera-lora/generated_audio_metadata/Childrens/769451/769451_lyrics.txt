Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard To give her poor dog a bone
But when she came there, the cupboard was bare And so the poor dog had none
She went to the baker's to buy him some bread
But when she came back the poor dog was dead
She went to the joiners to buy him a coffin
But when she came back the poor dog was laughing
She took a clean dish to get him some tripe
But when she came back he was smoking a pipe
She went to the alehouse to get him some beer
But when she came back the dog sat in a chair
She went to the tavern for white wine and red
But when she came back the dog stood on his head
She went to the hatter's to buy him a hat
But when she came back he was feeding the cat
She went to the barber's to buy him a wig
But when she came back he was dancing a jig
She went to the fruiters to buy him some fruit
But when she came back he was playing the flute
She went to the tailors to buy him a coat
But when she came back he was riding a goat
She went to the cobblers to buy him some shoes
But when she came back he was reading the news
She went to the seamstress to buy him some linen
But when she came back the dog was a spinning
She went to the hosers to buy him some hose
But when she came back he was dressed in his clothes
The dame made a curtsy, the dog made a bow
The dame said
Your servant the dog said bow wow
This wonderful dog was named Albert's delight
He could sing, he could dance, he could read, he could write
She gave him rich dainties whenever he fed
And erected a monument when he was dead
