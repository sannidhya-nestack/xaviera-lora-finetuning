Down in the middle of the dismal swamp
It's a little bit buggy, it's a little bit damp
And when it gets dark, hear a wimp and a wump
When you're down in the middle of the dismal swamp
Got to get out now, got to get out fast
a breathing human is breathing his last
It's a bogeyman buggy hear a footstep and thump
When you're down in the middle of the dismal swamp
It's an all alone feeling
It's gonna send you reeling
Gonna run away squealing
Hear a wimp and a womp
And a footstep in thought
When you're lost in the middle
Of the dismal swamp
