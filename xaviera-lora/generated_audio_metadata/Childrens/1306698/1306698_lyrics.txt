I got a new friend that's you
You got a new friend that's me
We can get together after school
And climb that big old tree
When the school year started
I didn't know a single kid
My teacher was cool
She showed me fun things they did
Like sliding down the slide
And playing hide and seek with other kids outside
Now I'm feeling happy, I'm so glad
I got a new friend, that's you
You got a new friend, that's me
Let's get together after school and play some road hockey
When you're a kid, the playtime never ends
We go to the beach, eat ice cream with our friends
We see the waves coming
Then we chase those waves back out again
It's so fun, I'm glad I got a new friend, yeah
I got a new friend, that's you
Got a new friend that's me
When we get together after school
Let's jump on your trampoline
You get down there boy
Being a kid and having fun is super duper cool
And always say please remember the golden rule
And make sure to include
The littlest kid and the coolest dude
That's the way you make and keep lots of friends
And if a friend is feeling sad
Remind them how much fun you had
Hanging out, playing with your pal
I got a new friend that's you
You got a new friend that's me
We can get together after school
We should get together after school
Let's get together after school
That's what good friends do
