I have a little dog named Joe. He's brown and very sweet. Except he chews up all my shoes, so I have got bare feet.
Hey, a little brown dog named Joe, I had shoes all in a row
Now they're gone, where did they go? You say you don't know
But why do you look so satisfied? Why do you look so fat?
Why you sneaking out the door? Why you looking at me like that?
Why don't you go chase the cat?
Sing, hey Joe, what do you know? You've got soul and heel and toe
Why do you choose to chew my shoes? A little brown dog named Joe
You sneak up on my sneakers and leave nothing but a single lace
My ballet shoe all pink and new vanished without a trace
My party shoes I seldom use they kinda pinch my toes
When you read the menu you said "I'll take two of those"
And why do you look so satisfied? Why do you lick your chucks?
Why do you choose to eat my shoes like they were lollipops?
The fun just never stops
Sing hey Joe, what do you know?
You've got soul and heel and toe
Why do you choose to chew my shoes?
A little brown dog named Joe
Hey Joe, you little brown dog
You are in disgrace
In fact, you are in the doghouse
Wipe that innocent look off your furry face
I had some lovely snow boots that is still there were chosen
Joe had a lovely leather breakfast now my toes are frozen
One day he found my tapped shoes he thought they tasted strange
Then he found my cowboy boots and now he rides the range
Hey Joe you little round dog I think you live to eat
Your favorite dish is most delish it's footwear nice and sweet
But I have got bare feet
Sing hey Joe what do you know
You've got soul and heel and toe
Though you choose to chew my shoes
I still love you so
Go, you little brown dog, go
Hey Joe, what do you know?
You've got soul and heel and toe
Why do you choose to chew my shoes?
You little brown dog named Joe
Hey Joe, what do you know?
You've got soul and heel and toe
Though you choose to chew my shoes
I still love you so
Now go, you little dog, you go
(dog barking)
(dog barking)
(dog barking)
Okay, Joe, can we try that one more time please?
All right, ready?
Okay, take two.
(dog barking)
Yep, that was good, Joe.
Was it good for you?
Great, okay, that's a wrap.
