We gather round the playground green
Shouts and giggles fill the scene
Every step's a bounding spree
No place we'd rather be
Oh, let's leap, let's sway
All our troubles drift away
Clap along, let the music cheer
Feel the rhythm ringing clear
Oh, let's leap, let's sway
No one else can stand in our way
We skip across the pavement wide
Cheering mates with hearts of pride
Tangled clues and secret codes
Joyful waves in playful modes
Hold that laughter, keep it bright
Caring faces day and night
We tumble, trip, then up we stand
Nothing halts our fearless band
Swapping jokes with shining eyes
These are times we truly prize
Oh, let's leap, let's sway
All our troubles drift away
Clap along, let the music cheer
Feel the rhythm ringing clear
Oh, let's leap, let's sway
No one else can stand in our way
Oh, as the echoes fade away
We hold this tune, come what may
