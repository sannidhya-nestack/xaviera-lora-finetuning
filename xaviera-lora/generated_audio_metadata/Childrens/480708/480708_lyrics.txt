Well, I got my toes tapping, how about you? Are your toes tapping?
That means it's time for a circle dance
So we're gonna make two circles
An inside circle and an outside circle
Okay circles, face each other
Now the person standing across from you, that's your partner
Say howdy partner
Okay, now you have a job to do
You have to listen to the callers
That's us, we'll tell you what to do
Inside circle, you have an important job
When you hear us say move along
Walk in that circle to your next partner
Get in your circles, one two three
Face your partner and listen to me
Bow into your partner and stand up tall
Give him a high five and shout yeehaw
If you're doing all the motions, you can't go wrong
You'll sit down, stand up, turn around and song
If you're doing all the motions, you can go wrong
Is to sit down, stand up, turn around and song
Grab your partner's hands
Go around in your own little circle
Get ready
And stop
Go the other way
And stop
Now inside circle, move along
A brand new partner, one, two, three
Face each other and listen to me
Wave up high and down below
Shake your bottom and shout hello
Hello!
If you're doing all the motions you can't go wrong
It's a sit down, stand up, turnaround song
If you're doing all the motions you can't go wrong
It's a sit down, stand up, turnaround song
Grab your partner's hands again, go around in your own circle
Get ready, stop, go the other way, and stop
Now inside circle, move along
Another new partner, howdy-do, say howdy-do
Get ready to try something new
Stand next to your partner, how'bout that?
Tap your foot now front and back
If you're doing all the motions, you can't go wrong
It's a sit down, stand up, turnaround song
If you're doing all the motions, you can go wrong
It's a sit down, stand up, turnaround song
It's a sit down, stand up, turnaround song
