I'm going to tell you a story of two rolly pollys who were happy as they could be.
They lived under a big grey rock in the dark near a very tall green tree.
Their names were Ramona and Rafael and they were sister and brother.
They were best friends and siblings and spent all of their time with one another.
Rafael was a little afraid of things that were loud or unexpected, so Ramona came up
with a great plan to help him stay unaffected.
She told him that roly-polies have a secret power, and some humans have it too.
A special place to hide away when the world seems scary to you.
She showed him how to curl his body to find his safest place.
Then she turned out the light and brought down the sound by covering his ears and face.
"Any time you need a break," she said, "from a world that has made you worry,
just roll into your quiet place that you never have to worry about sharing."
So Raphael practiced his roly-poly dance until he could get it all done real quick.
Tuck, close, cover and smile.
He could complete it, lickety-split. "It's fun being a roly-poly," he giggled. "I love to rock and roll." Ramona smiled back at him. "I'm glad, because that was the goal."
Now when we need some space or quiet
There's nothing we can't weather
We'll roll ourselves into safe little balls
And get through it together
