Hey, hey, hey, everybody, come with me
I see a place that's super happy
Big red gate, waving cats
Where could it be, where are we at?
Jump to Japan, clap your hands
Clap your hands, jump to Japan
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Sushi rolls rolling bright
Cherry blooming pink and white
Dancing in a paper fan
Smiling faces everywhere we can
Jump to Japan
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Jump to Japan
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Let's hop like a bunny, spin like tops
Shout out loud, we just can't stop
Let's jump and move, spin around the land
All together we take a scan
Jump to Japan, clap your hands
Clap your hands, jump to Japan
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Say thank you goodbye'til we play again
Let's jump back in, bring every friend
Jump to Japan, clap your hands, clap your hands
Jump to Japan, Japan, clap your hands, clap hands
