Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are gone
All but one, and her name is Anne
She crept under the pudding pan
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are gone
All but one, and her name is Anne
And she crept under the pudding pan
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird, Lady Bird
Lady Bird, Lady Bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are gone
All but one, and her name is Anne
She crept under the pudding pan
