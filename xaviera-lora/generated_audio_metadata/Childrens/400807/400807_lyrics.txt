Looking under couches, looking under chairs
Looking on the windowsills, looking on the stairs
Looking in the flower bed beside the kitchen door
Can you guess what it is? Are there any more?
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
Some are hiding way up high and some are on the ground
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
The Easter Bunny's been here, will they all be found?
Lookin' in my sister's room underneath the bed
Lookin' on the top of shelves maybe there instead
Lookin' in my kitty's house then in doggy's dish
Maybe that old bunny put some eggs in with the fish
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
Some are hidin' way up high and some are on the ground
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
The Easter Bunny's been here, will they all be found?
Looking in the corners, looking under rugs
Looking in the tall grass where there's lots of bugs
Looking everywhere and oh it's so much fun
Such fun to look for eggs'til Easter day is done
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
Some are hiding way up high and some are on the ground
Easter eggs, Easter eggs hidden all around
The Easter bunnies been here, will they all be found?
The Easter bunnies been here, will they all be found?
Bye kids, and have a really happy Easter! Bye everybody!
