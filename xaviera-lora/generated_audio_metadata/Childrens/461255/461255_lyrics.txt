You can count on me
I'm your friend, you see
Give me a paw, slap me some fur
I'll be beside you no matter what occurs
I'll be your pal and that's the key
you can count on me
When you're feeling down
I'll wipe away that frown
If you need a laugh
I'll bring a smile
You'll feel your grin spreading
In a while
I'll make the world a comedy
you can count on me
Why do things all by yourself when I could lend a hand
When you need someone to get things done
I will be the only one'cause I'll be there for you
We're a lucky pair that we're both aware
Like a pair of shoes, we come in twos
If you ask a favor, I can't refuse
Never doubt my love, Z,'cause you can count on me
Why do things all by yourself when I could lend a hand?
When you need someone to get things done
I will be the only one'cause I'll be there for you
You can count on me'cause I'm your friend, you see
Give me a paw, slap me some foot
I'll be beside you no matter what occurs
I'll be your pallet and that's the key'cause
You can count on me, it bears repeating that
You can count on me, oh yeah yeah
You can count on me
