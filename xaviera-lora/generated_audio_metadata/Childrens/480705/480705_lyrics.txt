I like the stars over my head, sand under my feet
My blanket wrapped around me when I go to sleep
In front and behind, up and down you see
I'm thankful for all the things around me
I like the sun over my head, grass under my toes
I like snow falling down when I'm wearing warm clothes
In front and behind, up and down you see
I'm thankful for all the things around me
I like the flowers in front of me, they smell so sweet
My brother hiding behind the tree, playing hide and seek
My dad standing behind me, pushing me on the swing
My mom there in front of me, tying my shoe strings
I like the tiny fish swimming under the sea
The fluffy white clouds that float over me
In front and behind, up and down you see
I'm thankful for all the things around me
Around me
They're all around me
