There's a star shining bright
Make a wish and it might come true
When it lights up the night
Shines down on me and you
On the sands of the Sahara
On a mountain high
On the rainforest of Brazil
It shines on you and I
There's a star shining bright
Make a wish and it might come true
When it lights up the night
Shines down on me and you
It shines its light across the oceans
Shines across the seas
And when I rest my head at night
It shines its light on me
From Managua to Kinshasa, Kiev to Palestine
Wherever you make your home
You can watch it shine, shine
There's a star shining bright
Make a wish and it might come true
When it lights up the night
Shines down on me and you
There's a star shining bright
Make a wish and it might come true
When it lights up the night
It shines down on me and you
