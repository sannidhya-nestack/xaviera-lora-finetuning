Found a house full of cats, said the classified ad
Gone astray and otten, neglected and sad
If you're missing a kitten, we'd like to suggest
That you claim it at 17 Prospect Park West
In the morning the children awakened, all smiles
To find hundreds of cat lovers lined up for miles
"Jeremiah, my darling, come right home with mother"
They greeted their kittens one after the other
"Oh, Tinkerbell dear, it's too good to be true"
"It's better to buy sweets, could it really be you?"
Then they carried their cats off to far away places
In boxes and baskets and carrying cases
Until by the end of that long happy day
Every last homeless cat had been taken away
It was quiet where Lucy and Eleanor sat
And there wasn't a sign of a calico cat
Until all of a sudden
A scratch at the door made them think
Of a scratch that they'd both heard before
It was scratching of such a particular kind
That they weren't surprised in the slightest to find
That a kitten with markings of black, white, and red
And a cluster of stripes on the top of her head
Spots of white on her stomach and white on her chest
Had discovered her way back to Prospect Park West
So they took down the saucer and took down the dish
And they gave her a supper of sweet cream and fish
"Don't you ever run off again, kitty," they said
And exhausted but happy they climbed into bed
"Pleasant dreams," said their mother, and kissed them goodnight
And both Lucy and Eleanor knew she was right
All cats like to wander, all cats like to roam
But sooner or later they're sure to come home
