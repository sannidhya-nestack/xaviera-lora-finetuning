Young butts, rolling streets alive
Wheels turning, dreams inside
Laughter bouncing off the sky
I'm a rocket bus at night
Flying high in alien light
Daytime comes I'll roll again
Through streets of joy and friends
Animals chatter kids all cheer
Whistles hum in every gear
Morning sun I'll re-agear
But though the stars, they call my name
Night falls, nothing's quite the same
I'm a rocket bus at night
Flying high in alien light
Daytime comes, I'll roll again
Through streets of joy and friends
I burn
Engines roaring through the void
Colors bursting, worlds destroyed
Back to earth where hearts collide
I'm a rocket lost at night
Flying high in alien light
Daytime comes, I rule again
Through streets of joy and friends
Through streets of joy and friend
Through streets of joy and friend
Through streets of joy and friend
Through streets of joy and friend
Thank you everybody, here's a king-butcher of all I care
What to do with the void, colors burst and worlds destroyed
Back to earth where hearts collide
