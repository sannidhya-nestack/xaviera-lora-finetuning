My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me
My Barney lies over the ocean
My Barney lies over the sea
My Barney lies over the ocean
Oh bring back my Barney to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me
