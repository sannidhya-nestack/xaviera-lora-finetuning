Buzz, buzz, busy bee, through another day
Buzz, buzz, busy bee, it all turned out okay
Buzz, buzz, busy bee, it's time for us to rest
Buzz, buzz, busy bee, I know you did your best
Breathe in, little bee, in and out and once again
Breathe out, little bee, though busy you have been
Breathe in, little bee. Relax your wings and mind.
Breathe out, little bee. Leave worries all behind.
Sleep deep, little bee, and I will keep you safe.
Sleep deep, sweetest bee. Awake at your own pace.
Sleep deep, little bee, the silence we won't break.
Sleep deep, sweetest bee, until it's time to wake.
Sleep deep, sweetest bee.
