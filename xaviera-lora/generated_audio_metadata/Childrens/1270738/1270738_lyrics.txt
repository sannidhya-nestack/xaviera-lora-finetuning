They've chipped away at Plymouth Rock for one hundred years
And it needs to stop if it goes on and on and on
Before we know it, the rock'll be gone
What say you, town fathers?
What say you, child farmers?
We'll protect this rock
It marks the spot where they disembarked
We'll protect this rock, rock
Although it's just (although it's just) made of granite (made of granite)
There's nothing like it (there's nothing like it)
On the planet (on the planet) the stepping stones (the stepping stones) of our forefathers (of our forefathers) should not be chiseled (should not be chiseled) by souvenir hunters
What say you, town fathers?
What say you, town fathers?
We'll protect this rock
It marks the spot where they disembarked
We'll protect this rock
So we moved the rock
But it got dropped
Oh, we tried so hard
To protect this rock
Rock
Rock
We'll protect this rock
