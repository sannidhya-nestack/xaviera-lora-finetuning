Whenever it's our bedtime, the kids all gather'round
Mama puts her jammers on and we all sit right down
There's a million tiny pictures in the jammers that she wears
Everyone has got a story she tells when as we stare at Mama's pajamas
There's a world of happy days
And mama's pajamas are imagination sales
And mama's pajamas disclose a funny side
And mama's pajamas gives us less delight
There's kings and queens and princesses and unicorns who speak
There's wizards, imps and statues and mountains with high peaks
There's cowboys, plains and castles all up and down her sleeves
We pick one out and listen to the stories that she weaves
On my mom's pajamas there's a world of happy days
Her mama's pajamas (imagination fails)
Oh, mama's pajamas (there's loads of funny signs)
Her mama's pajamas (gives us such delight)
Now here is something very strange
The pictures always seem to change
There's something new each time we look (each time we look)
At Mama's pajamas (there's a world of happy tales)
At Mama's pajamas (our imagination sails)
At Mama's pajamas (there's loads of funny signs)
Mama's pajamas (gives us such delight)
Some nights she tells a sad tale
Some nights a comedy
At times she is suspenseful
With a clever mystery
We visit foreign countries
And stars and galaxies
Our bedtime is the best time
In our family
At Mama's pajamas
There's a world of happy tales
Mama's pajamas
Our imagination saves
Mamas, puja, amores (Pesos, apandiza)
Mama's pajamas
Gives us less delight
Ooh, we be jammin'
Jammin' on mama's pajamas
Ooh, we be jammin'
Jammin' on mama's pajamas
Ooh, we be jammin'
Jammin' on mama's pajamas
Ooh, we be jammin'
Jammin' on mama's pajamas
Ooh, we be jammin'
Jammin' on mama's pajamas
Ooh, it be jammin', jammin' on my mama's pajamas (on my mama's pajamas)
Ooh, it be jammin', jammin' on my mama's pajamas (her imagination saves)
Ooh, it be jammin', jammin' (on my mama's pajamas)
