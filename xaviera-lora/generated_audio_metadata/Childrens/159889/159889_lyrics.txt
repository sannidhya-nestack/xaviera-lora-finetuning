There's a garden in this room
There's a tiny flower
Honeybee, watch her grow
Sweeter by the hour
And I will rock you all night long
And I will rock you with my song
And I will rock you'til the morning
There's a child in this room
Darkness all around her
Once I dreamed of this room
Dreamed of her then found her
And I will rock you all night long
And I will rock you with my song
And I will rock you'til the morning
So go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep my darling
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep my darling
There's an angel in this room
Other angels round her
Sing her song all night long
Aren't they glad they found
And I will rock you all day long
And I will rock you with my song
And I will rock you'til the morning
And I will rock you all night long
And I will rock you with my song
And I will rock you'til the morning
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep my darling
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep my darling
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, my darling
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, darling
