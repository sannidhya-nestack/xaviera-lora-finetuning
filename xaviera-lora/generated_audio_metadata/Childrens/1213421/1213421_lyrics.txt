We are the girls who venture out to sea
The daughters of the British nobility
Villainy, oh piracy
Rule our lives just like the pirate men
Let's sing again
Pirate ladies are we (Pirate ladies are we)
Pirate ladies are we
It's said we are the pretty girls of crime
But we remember when there was a time of honesty
Oh loyalty
Rule the lies and pour the soul to death
Take another breath
Pirate ladies are weak (Pirate ladies are weak)
Pirate ladies are weak
If we had not changed to sailing'cross the waves
At home we'd be just like those women slaves
Purgatory, no not for me
We earn our hands some wage that we deserve
We've got enough
Pirate Ladies are we! (Pirate Ladies are we!)
Pirate Ladies are we! (Over there!)
Come on, little ladies! (Come on, little ladies!)
Come on, little ladies! (Come on, little ladies!)
Anyone seen my parrot? (Over there!)
Pay me beauties! (Over there!)
Pirate Lady! (Over there!)
Come on! (Pirate Ladies!)
Shiver me timbers!
Pirate Ladies
Pirate Ladies, oh Pirate Ladies, oh Pirate Ladies are we
