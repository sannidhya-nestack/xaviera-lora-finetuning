Today is the best day of my life
Today I'll try to do things right
The past is otten tomorrow's not here
So today is all I've got and it's right here
Today I'll change my bad to good
Today I'll do the things I should
Today I will make a new person out of me
Yes today I will be all that I can be
Today there's victory inside me
Today I feel that I am free
At night when I sleep in my bed I'll feel so right
Because today I've tried to change with all my might
Today is the best day of my life
Today I'll try to do things right
The past is otten, tomorrow's not here
So today is all I've gotten, it's right here
Today is all I've got and it's right here
