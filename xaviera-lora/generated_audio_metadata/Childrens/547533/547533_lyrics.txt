Bunny Foo Foo
Come here little field mice
Little field mice
Little Bunny Foo Foo hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head
Down came the fairy, princess and said
Little Bunny Foo Foo I don't want to see you
Scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head
I'll give you three more chances
And then I'll turn you into a goon
Goon? What's a goon?
Bunny Foo Foo, Bunny Foo Foo
But I like to bop him on the head!
Bunny Foo Foo
Little Bunny Foo Foo hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice and popping them on the head
Down came the fairy princess and said
Little Bunny Foo Foo I don't wanna see you
Scooping up the field mice and popping them on the head
I'll give you two more chances, and then I'll turn you into a goon!
I don't know what a goon is!
Funny foo foo!
Funny foo foo!
Come here little field mice!
Funny foo foo!
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin'em on the head
Down came the fairy princess and she said
Little Bunny Foo-Foo I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin'em on the head
I'll give you one more chance, and then I'll turn you into a goon!
I wasn't bumping him!
Bunny Fu Fu
Bunny Fu Fu
Hey, I was just playing with him! Yeah, just playing with him!
Bunny Fu Fu
Little bunny FooFoo hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice and popping them on the head
Down came the fairy princess and this is what she said
I gave you three chances to stop and you didn't
Poof, you're a goon
Moral of the story, here today, goon tomorrow
(maniacal laughter)
