Well, it's crazy what you do when you sleep (when you sleep)
Well, it's crazy what you do when you're asleep (when you sleep)
You might make a snoring noise when you dream about your toys
It's crazy what you do when you sleep (when you sleep)
Well, it's crazy what you do when you bathe (when you bathe)
It's crazy what you do when you bathe
You might move your foot and splash
You might have yourself a blast
It's crazy what you do when you bathe
Those crazy things, those crazy things
Those crazy things, that's what I love
Those crazy things, those crazy things
Those crazy things, that's what I love
Well it's crazy what you do when you play
Well it's crazy what you do when you play
You might run and jump and shout
You might even start to pout
It's crazy what you do when you play
Well it's crazy what you do when you eat
Well it's crazy what you do when you eat
You might use a fork or spoon
You might even sing a tune

Crazy things, those crazy things, those crazy things, those crazy things, that's what I love
It's crazy what you do when you play
But it's crazy what you do when you play

You might even start to pound
It's crazy what you do when you play
But it's crazy what you do when you sleep
But it's crazy what you do when you sleep
You might make a snoring noise
When you dream about your toys
It's crazy what you do when you sleep
But it's the crazy things are the crazy things
The crazy things that's what I love
The crazy things are the crazy things
The crazy things that's what I love
So it's the crazy things are the crazy things
The crazy things that's what I love
Those crazy things, those crazy things
Those crazy things, that's what I love

Those crazy things, that's what I love
Those crazy things, that's what I love
