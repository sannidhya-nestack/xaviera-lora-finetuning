It's very clear, you want a souvenir
I'm Plymouth Rock, a souvenir I'm not
And I'd wish you'd stop
Ouch, stop that, stop that
I don't like that, that's a fact
Ouch, stop that, stop that
I don't like that
That's a fact, I'm big and strong
But I won't be for long
Just trying to say
That I'll be gone someday
If you keep taking me away, I'll stop that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact, out, stop that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact
Tourists, Plymouth has wonderful stores with
Plymouth rock items, glorious
Pictures and postcards and more
Of me, so out, stop that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact, I don't like that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact, I don't like that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact, I don't like that
Stop that, I don't like that
That's a fact, I don't like that
