Yonder come day
Day is a-breaking
Yonder come day
Oh my soul
Yonder come day
Day is a-breaking
Sun is a-rising
In my soul
Yonder come day
Day is a-breaking
Yonder come day
Oh, my soul, you're the golden day
Day is awaken, sun is arising in my soul
In the morning, look out your window
The moon has gone somewhere
But you know it's out there
Shining somewhere far away
You can't see it but you know it's there
Day is beginning, your mother holds you
You smell sunshine in her hair
Your mother loves you, you can just feel her love
You can't see it but you know it's there
What makes your heart beat?
What makes the days go by?
What makes clouds and fire and air?
What makes you who you are?
There's some kind of magic in this world
You can't see it but you know it's there
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hear the whistle of the train
Your daddy's coming, coming home
From far away somewhere
He's thinking of you
You can just feel his love
You can't see it but you know it's there
When day is over, look out your window
The sun has gone somewhere, but you know it's out there
Maybe it's shining over China, you can't see it but you know it's there
You can't see it but you know it's there
You can't see it but you know it's there
You can't see it but you know it's there
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
