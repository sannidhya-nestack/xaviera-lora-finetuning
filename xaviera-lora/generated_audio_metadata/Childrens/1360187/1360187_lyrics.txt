Hello, hello, it's me (it's me)
Feeling a little new, you see
Not sure what today will bring
Something strange, feeling on sting
Let's be brave, wave hello
Step by step, here we go
Let's be brave, wave hello
Smiling wide, ready to grow
I see someone over there
Looking shy, I'm aware
One foot close, one foot back
Heartbeat quick, no time to slow
Bake a low, bake a low
One speed thirty, ball shot
Do that shotscape better
Bake a low
They be ready
Stalling wide
Ready to grow
One little wave
Here and here
Together is forever
In your chest begin
Let's go
Let's go
Let's be brave, wave hello
Step by step, here we go
Let's be brave, wave hello
Smiling wide, ready to grow
That peace one, two and three
Waiting to get, when to get vegan
