Humpty Dumpty, he sat on the wall (He's got Humpty sitting on the wall)
Humpty Dumpty, he had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
Yeah, Humpty Dumpty, he had a big fall
He's a good Humpty
Fell down, he fell down
Humpty Dumpty, he heard all the jokes
The not-so-funny comments from all of the folks
Like how he was not all he was cracked up to be
The yolk was on him, was he shell-shocked to see
That he was humpty-dumpty and had a great fall
Come on, swing baby
The papers converged at the scene of the fall
Did you just slip (you are) or were you pushed off the wall (you are)
Na na na na na na
Are you gonna sue or do you have some regrets
Are you scrambled up will you end up omelets yeah (oh oh oh oh)
Humpty Dumpty (oh oh oh oh)
You had a big bowl yeah yeah yeah
Who loves eggs, baby? Exactly
Humpty Dumpty, yeah, Humpty Dumpty
Humpty, sitting on the wall
Yeah, I think you're a little shell-shocked, Humpty
You were always an egghead anyway
