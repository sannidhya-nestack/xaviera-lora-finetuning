Imagine a field with balloons in the air
With candy cane trees and chocolatey glares
Someone is waving you way back, really
The child with the rainbow hair
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Eddie, Eddie
Walking on clouds
In a world filled with chill
Where I street castles, ozones, and sweets
Untang-y
Here goes the flooding as you hop on this
Oh, sadly props so fantastically high
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Dreaming in the land of wonder
Bouncing bubbles all around
Smiles and laughter as they bound
Slashing colors everywhere
Magic fills the dreamland air
She made me in the land of money
She made me in the land of money
She made me in the land of money
