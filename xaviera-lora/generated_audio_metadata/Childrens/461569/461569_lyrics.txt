I asked my mother for fifty cents
To see the elephants jump the fence
He jumped so high he reached the sky
And didn't come back till the fourth of July
Asked my mother for fifty cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
He jumped so high he reached the sky
And didn't come back till the fourth of July
I asked my mother for fifty cents
The cheeky elephant jumped the fence
He jumped so high he reached the sky
And didn't come back till the fourth of July
I asked my mother for fifty cents
I asked my mother for fifty cents
