It's Monday, gotta get up again
I wish it was Sunday still
Wish I could sleep, just go for forty winks
Get up slowly, take my time (hey Elizabeth)
So much for that
Put on your shoes and the little pink hat and grab that pack
What's for breakfast, what's for lunch
Some slurp and crunch and go
And we're out the door and we're in the car
With the boy next door and we're gone
We're sleepy but we're gone
Hit the road Jack, say uh uh uh
Hit the road say uh uh uh
Chocolatza
So we get to school and it's big and busy
Lots of kids doing everything you can think of
Add this, take away this, multiply this
Go ah, ah, ah, read it, write it, tell me all about it
Then you got that science project
Watch that frog see what she does to that fly
Ouch, that's gotta hurt
Go ah, ah, ah
Ah, hear the fly go, "Yikes! Ouch! Goodbye, fly !"
Now here is my Egyptian statue
Made it myself, made it myself
With just a little help, just a little help
It's kinda dusty, supposed to look like it's really old
And painted brown and blue, brown and blue
You know, like in the olden days they do
Do you get the picture? (Yes, ma'am!)
Do you get the picture? (School's out!)
Say what? (Say school's out!)
Say ah, ah, ah, chocolatea
School's out and we hit the road
And now it's time for my ballet
With a pink tutu and a grand plié
And Nora has karate
And it's way far, way far away
With a kick and a chop and a kick chop chop
And Robbie's got a trombone lesson
Bones, dem bones, dem bones
And we're on the road, on the road again
Say ah, ah, ah, chocolate!
No place like home, no place like home
Like Dorothy said in that movie
But she never would take her shoes off
But I do, I do
And I just stop
Everything
For a minute
While I catch my breath and I'm up again
the house is full of cookies and kids
Cookies and kids
And a brand new puppy who eats my shoes
While I eat chocolate chips, chocolate chips
Say ah, ah, ah
Chocolata
You can't even see me when I'm around you
When I'm around you
Homework, homework, that's my name
Ask me again and I'll say the same
Read it, write it, tell me all about it
Elizabeth! Spaghetti time
I love spaghetti, love spaghetti, love it
All right already
Steady, Betty, every pretty loves spaghetti
Bath time! And brush those teeth
Go up and down and underneath and
Bed time! It's time to go where every dreamer goes at night
Put out the lights, see out your window shining bright
Moon, stars, and mommy's garden, flowers in a row
And everything's right, say ah, ah, ah
Everything's right, say ah, ah, ah
Everything's right, everything's right, ah, ah, ah
Tomorrow is another day, Tuesday to be exact
My backpack's packed, my lunch is sacked
My books are stacked, the ducks have quacked
Good night, good night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
