I went to a party the other night
I learned a new dance, it was out of sight
Called the Wack-A-Wacky, it's easy to do
Come on everyone, we'll teach it to you
You gotta shrug your shoulders, shrug your shoulders
Knock your knees, knock your knees
Turn yourself around, turn around
And jump one, two, one, two, three
Flap your arms, flap your arms
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
Howl out the moon
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Then you've done the wacko wacky
Then you've done the wacko wacky
Today at lunch I was dancing at school
Everyone thought it was really cool
My teacher joined in and the principal too
the wacko wacky is the in thing to do
You gotta shrug your shoulder
Shrug your shoulders, knock your knees, knock your knees
Turn yourself around, turn around and jump
One, two, one, two, three
Flap your arms, flap your arms
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
Howl up the moon, howl, howl, howl
Then you've done the wacko wacky
Then you've done the wacko wacky
It's the new dance craze that's sweeping the nation
Everyone's doing no exaggeration
You can do it anytime, you can do it anywhere
Even at home in your underwear
You gotta shrug your shoulders, shrug your shoulders
Knock your knees, knock your knees
Turn yourself around, turn around
And jump one, two, one, two, three
Flap your arms, flap your arms
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
How'bout the moon?
Ow, ooh, ooh
Then you've done the wacko wacky
Then you've done the wacko wacky
We're gonna give you one more chance
How much faster can you dance?
Drug your shoulders, drug your shoulders
Knock your knees, knock your knees
Turn yourself around, turn around
And jump one, two, one, two, three
Flap your arms
Flap your arms, stick out your tongue
Stick out your tongue, howl at the moon
Owl, owl, ooooh
Then you've done the wacko wacky
Now you've done the wacko wacky
Now you've done the wacko wacky
Wacko wacky
