When I was a baby, a little tiny baby
I was just a sugarplum, I was brand new
Mama woulda picked me up, picked me up
Up, up, up and down the hallway
Here's what she'd do, she'd go
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, ah
And when I was a baby, I was tiny as a tomcat
Crying in the cradle, looking for a lullaby
Mama comes to pick me up, pick me up, up
I'm gonna rock you, baby, gonna lullaby you
She go uh-uh-ka-chi-chi uh-uh-uh uh-uh-ka-chi-chi uh
When I was a little bigger standing on two feet
Just a little bigger maybe one maybe two
Mama comes a looking for me great big smiling mama
With the rhythm stuck in her shoe going uh uh uh uh uh
Get the rhythm now, you can do it baby, come on baby dance with me, get the rhythm now
When I was four I was a floating like a butterfly
Life was just a garden all full of flowers
Every day a twilight, mama wouldn't catch me up
Hold me with a rhythm that was only ours
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now that I'm eight, well almost very soon
I can do anything, almost anything
Jump rope, skip rope, ride a bike
Camp penny, sing a song and tune player
Small piano, eat a king sized cookie
Climb a king sized tree
But I still like sitting on my mama's knee
Singing uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
And I can jump rope, skip rope, ride a bike, camp any singer, song and tune player
Small piano, jump rope, skip rope, ride a bike, camp any singer, song and tune player
Small piano, jump rope, skip rope, ride a bike, camp any singer, song and tune player
Small piano, jump rope, skip rope, ride a bike, camp any singer, song and tune player
Small piano
