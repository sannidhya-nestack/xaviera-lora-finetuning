When I'm in a place where there's not one familiar face
I turn a little reddish and my heart begins to ace
I feel so shy I want to disappear
Without a trace
Then a strange thing happens if I stay around a while
My heart slows down, my face turns pink and I begin to smile
I start to walk around and then I see some things to do
And then someone comes up and asks me
Can I play with you?
Now when I visit a brand new place
And I see someone with a reddish face
I say, don't worry if you don't see
A familiar face in this whole place
And soon their face gets nice and pink
They feel alright
And we're having fun
Happens to us all, I think
