A, the alphabet is fun
B, beginning bun
And C, my crayons come in any color
Doo, doo, doo
D
C-D-E-F-G
Oh my golly gee
H-I feel happy inside
J-K-L-M like marshmallows and men
N's nice now and then
N-O-P-Q, you are my friend
S, it slithers like a snake
T, takes time to take
U-V, under very big waves
W, X, Y, Z
zebras zoom and run
They zigzag at the zoo
But before they knew it
The alphabet song was done
