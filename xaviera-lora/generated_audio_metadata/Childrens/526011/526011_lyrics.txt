Walking down the street one day to make something for lunch
Getting the ingredients, I buy them by the bunch
Thought I'd make a cake that's great for my Uncle Sam
He really likes the way I cook and he's a really hungry man
I mix it up, I mix it up, I mix it up
Stir and mix and fold and whisk, let's bake
Bake a cake, let's bake
Bake a cake, let's bake
Bake a cake, let's bake
Bake a yummy cake
Searchin' in the cookin' book for the special recipe
Collectin' pots and pans for me to make that yummy tea
Lots of different flavors, something for everyone
Chocolate, fruit and strawberry, pineapple and plum
I'll mix it up, I'll mix it up, I'll mix it up
Stir and mix and fold and whisk
Let's bake a cake, I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake a cake, I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake a cake, I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake
Bake a yummy cake
Cake cake I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake
Cake cake I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake
Cake cake I wanna bake a cake
Let's bake
Bake a yummy cake
Let's bake
