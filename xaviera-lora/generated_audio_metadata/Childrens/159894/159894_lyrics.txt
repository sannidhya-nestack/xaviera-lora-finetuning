There was a farmer had a feeling in the middle of the night
There was a farmer had a feeling something was not right
So he counted all his chickens and he counted all his sheep
And he sat down on a haystack and he soon fell fast asleep
And there the farmer had a dream in the middle of the night
Some children did a circle dance
Little hands holding tight
And around and round the cornfield
They danced the whole night long
Then the farmer woke up in the hay
When he heard them sing this song
Singing John John, the farmer's son, your daddy loves you so
Go dancing with your partner and then let your partner go
Go dancing with your partner and then let your partner know
There was a farmer heard a cry in the middle of the night
It was John John the farmer's son and something was not right
So the old man rocked the cradle and he counted lots of sheep
And then the farmer kissed his son and he was still asleep
Thinking John, John, the farmer's son, your daddy loves me so
Go dancing with your partner and then let your partner go
Go dancing with your partner and then let your partner go
Singing John, John, the farmer's son
Your daddy loves you so
Go dancing with your partner
And then let your partner go
Go dancing with your partner
And then let your partner go
