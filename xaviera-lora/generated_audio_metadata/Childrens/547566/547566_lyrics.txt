Holding her teddy bear so close
She'll dream of the things she loves the most
She'll fly like an eagle with gossamer wings
She'll fly away beyond all the stars
I love my baby, she loves me so
Now and forever, this much I know
When the night comes I will turn out the light
Tell her a story and kiss her goodnight
Tell her a story and kiss her goodnight
