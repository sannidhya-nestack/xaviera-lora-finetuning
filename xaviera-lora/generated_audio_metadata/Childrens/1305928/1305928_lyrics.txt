No, no, no
No, no, no
We meet in the kitchen bright
Laughter flows in sweet delight
Flour drifts in puffy clouds
Chalk chips tumble cheering crowd
Cookie time, so full of cheer
Crystal light that draws us near
Warm aroma in every bite
All together it feels so right
Nom nom nom
Nom nom nom
Each heavy oven, watch them bake
Crisp-edged goodness, soon to make
Rich aroma fills the air
Smiling faces everywhere
Even when a spill appears
We just grin and calm our fears
Stirring fun with gentle care
Joy emerges baked to share
Cookie time so full of cheer
Crystal light that draws us near
Warm aroma in every bite
All together it feels so right
Nom nom nom
Nom nom nom
When day is done sweet memories
Cookie love in times like these
Oh, oh, oh
When day is done, sweet memories
Cookie love in times like these
