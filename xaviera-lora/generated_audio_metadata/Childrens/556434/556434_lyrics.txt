Everybody smile, smile, smile
Everybody laugh, laugh, laugh
Everybody ha, ha, ha and have some fun
Everybody sing, sing, sing
Everybody swing, swing, swing
Everybody sway to the song of love
Everybody smile, smile, smile
Everybody laugh, laugh, laugh
Everybody la, la, la and show some love
Everybody dance, dance, dance
Everybody cha, cha, cha
Everybody march to the beat of a drum
Feel the sunshine down
Spread its warmth all around
Change your frowning face
Wear a smile everyday
Everybody smile, smile, smile
Everybody laugh, laugh, laugh
Everybody ha, ha, ha and have some fun
Everybody sing, sing, sing
Everybody swing, swing, swing
Everybody sway to the song of love
Everybody smile, smile, smile
Everybody love, love, love
Everybody ha, ha, ha and hug someone
Everybody dance, dance, dance
Everybody cha, cha, cha
Everybody march to the beat of the drum
Everybody laugh, everybody laugh
Everybody smile
Everybody love, everybody laugh
Everybody smile
