Tell me of songs you want to sing
Tell me of dreams you want to dream
Tell me of stars that shine above
Tell me about all the things that you love
Tell me you want me to hold you tight
Rock you until the morning light
Tell me of how you need me so
These are the things that I want to know
A world filled with warmth
Come share that world with me
Tell me what you see
And I'll tell you what is yet to be
Tell me of things your teddy bear says when he's alone with you
In bed
Tell me your places you want to go
These are the things that I want to know (I want to know)
Oh please tell your daddy'cause he loves you so
