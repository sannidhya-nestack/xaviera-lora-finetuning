(laughing)
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang
Crash bang boom, something's going on in Nora's room
Sounds like girls, sounds like boys
Sounds like someone's making lots of noise
Crash bang, crash bang boom, something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang
Crash bang boom, something going on in Nora's room
Now how much noise does a little girl need?
Sounds like the whole city zoo got freed
Sounds like the bear is dancing with the moose
They like to dance when they're on the loose
Sounds like hippos at a hippo hop
Or when you pick up a piano and you let it drop
Were sixteen pumpkins falling off a truck or were a couple
A gorilla's playing duck duck duck duck
Goose bang crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Like London Bridge is really falling down
Or a couple of giants are sitting on a town
Or 47 monkeys are talking on the phone
To 47 dogs who are fighting for a bone
Bark bark
Crash bang, crash bang boom, something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom, something's going on in Nora's room
Sounds like a rodeo right upstairs or a bunch of rhinos playing musical chairs
Sounds like a dump truck dumping its junk or an elephant hold down swing your trunk
Crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Sounds like girls, sounds like boys
Sounds like someone's making lots of noise
And the sign on her door says "enter if you dare"
So I just say, what's going on in there? (Nothing)
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom
Something's going on in Nora's room
Crash bang
Crash bang boom, something going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom, something going on in Nora's room
Crash bang, crash bang boom, something going on in Nora's
