Your daddy loves his coffee, he drinks it by the cup
Daddy says that coffee's gonna wake him right up
So I don't wanna drink what your daddy drinks because
All I want is forty winks
And daddy says I'm lazy but I'm crazy'bout my bed
Love those visions of sugar plums dancing in my head
Yeah, some people think that snoozing stinks, but all I want is forty winks
I asked your cousin Danny, he said, "Sleeping's for the birds"
And G ia Sam and Rosie Rue repeated those same words
Molly, Henry, Quinn and Kate and Elliot all agreed
That on their list of favorite things it's low priority
Yes every child I've ever known will say that bedtime stinks
But every loving mama loves her forty wings
Now I know millions of babies got to go to bed at night
And yes heaven knows they do fuss and they fight
Now I don't know why everybody wastes time protesting
I would rather waste my time resting in your dirty cells
You're lazy but I'm crazy'bout my bedlam
Those visions of your plumb go dancing in my head
Yes I don't
Hear what anyone thinks
All I want is forty weeks
Elizabeth and Nora think that sleeping is a bore
They think their bed's a trampoline and jumping's what it's for
It's only nine o'clock, get out that pogo stick says Kate
Then Willie laughs out loud if you announce it's getting late
Yes, every child I've ever known will say that bedtime stinks
But every loving mama loves her forty wings
Now I know all you wanna do is just to jump up and play
But I just wanna cozy up and call it a day
It's not that I don't like your tiddly wings
It's just that I love my forty wings
I don't care what anyone thinks
All I want is 40 weeks, yeah
I don't care what anyone thinks
All I want is 40 weeks, ah
