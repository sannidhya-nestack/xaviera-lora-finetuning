Fine day, fine day
Smiling all my troubles away
Sun is shining, clouds dividing
Such a fine, fine day
Sunrise, blue skies
Weather wise it's 8 okay
No denying, what am I in?
Such a fine, fine day
Wish the day could last forever
Love it I do
How about you?
Madam Crab and Mr. Seagull
Are heading my way
Maybe they'll say
Fine day, fine day
What's your name? Do you wanna play?
They'll surprise me when they hide me
Such a fine, fine day
What's your name? Do you wanna play?
Wish day could last forever
Love that I do, how about you?
Matt, Graham and Mr. Segal are heading my way
Maybe they'll say
Fine day, fine day
What's your name? Do you wanna play?
They'll surprise me when they hire me
Such a fine, fine day
Such a fine, fine day, hey
