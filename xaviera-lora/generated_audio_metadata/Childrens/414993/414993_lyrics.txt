Okay kids, grab those teddies and let's have fun
Grab your teddies and make'em shake
Grab your teddies, we're gonna make
A teddy bear dance that'll make'em quake
Shake'em up high, up to the sky
Shake'em down low to the ground below
Shake'em all around everywhere you go
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Hold a fuzzy fur in your little fist
Shake'em all around, do the teddy twist
Oh yeah!
Look into his little eyes
Make him bounce right off your thighs
Any bear can, no matter what size
Do a turn and hug him tight
Any bear can learn if you teach it right
Once he knows how, he'll probably dance all night
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Hold his fuzzy fur in your little fist
Shake him all around, do the teddy twist
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Do the teddy bear twist, the teddy twist
Hold his fuzzy fur in your little fist
Shake him all around, do the teddy twist
