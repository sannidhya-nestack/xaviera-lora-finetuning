Sleep little child, go to sleep
Mommy is here by your bed
Sleep little child, go to sleep
Rest on your pillow, your head
The world is silent and still
The moon shines bright on the hill
And creeps past your windowsill
Sleep little child go to sleep
Sleep little child go to sleep
Daddy will sing you a song
Sleep little child go to sleep
Dreamland is not far along
Hush now my baby don't fear
Mommy and daddy are near
And it's their voice as you hear
Sleep little child go to sleep
Sleep little child go to sleep
Sleep little child go to sleep
