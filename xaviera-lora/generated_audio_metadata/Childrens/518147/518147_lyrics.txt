If all the world was apple pie and all the sea was ink
And all the trees were bread and cheese what would we have to drink
Oh if all the world was apple pie and all the sea was ink
And all the trees were bread and cheese what would have to drink
If all the world was apple pie and all the sea was ink
And all the trees were bread and cheese, what would we have to drink?
Oh, if all the world was apple pie and all the sea was ink
And all the trees were bread and cheese, what would we have to drink?
If all the world was apple pie, what would we have to drink?
