There was an owl who lived up high in the branches of a very tall tree.
When she was young, her mother would ask her, "Who do you want to be?"
And Huwela would hoot, a very loud hoot,
And say without a doubt,
"One day when I'm older, I'll know,
And Mama, I'll make you proud."
And as Huwela got older, she did just that,
And started carefully choosing her friends.
She knew they would see her potential.
and accept her for who she's always been.
She loved the passion of the Raven Renata
and the charisma of Carlotta the Crow.
But she knew that she must also love herself.
And that couldn't be just for show.
So as Whoella got wiser and became more aware of her own amazing potential,
She chose to spend her quality time with those who considered her essential.
Huella decided to focus on being the best who she could be.
Because she figured out soon enough, I'm the only one who can be me.
