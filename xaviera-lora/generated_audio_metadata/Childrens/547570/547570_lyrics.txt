Hee, ho, hee, ho
I've been working on the railroad
All the live long day
I've been working on the railroad
Just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowing
Rise up so early in the morning
Can you hear the captain shouting
Dinah blow your horn
All aboard!
Dyna won't you blow, Dyna won't you blow, oh Dyna won't you blow your horn
Dyna won't you blow, Dyna won't you blow, oh Dyna won't you blow your horn
Someone in the kitchen with Dinah
Someone in the kitchen I know
Someone in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and singin'
Fee-fi-fiddly-i-ho
Fee-fi-fiddly-i-ho
B-E-I-B-E-I-O
Strummin' on the old banjo
He said he's strummin' on the old banjo
