Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder where you are
Up above the sky so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the clouds so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle
Little star
How I wonder where you are
Twinkle, twinkle
Little star
How I wonder where you are
How I wonder where you are
Twinkle little star
Up above, up above, up above the sky (I wonder, I wonder, I wonder where you are)
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle (a diamond in the sky) a diamond in the sky
How I wonder
Where you are, little star
