The little brother Davey had a Jubilee
Invited everybody in the family
To come and join in the revelry
We're gonna have a party at our favorite tree
The party went on all day and night
Audrey and Mo got into a fight
Kinsey said, "Ma, I need to be fed"
Brandon said, "I never want to go to bed"
Now you can bring Kelly or you can bring Sue
You can bring anyone you want to
You can bring Mom, you can bring Dad
You can be happy or you can be sad
Twenty-seven years have come and gone
Since my grandpa wrote this song
Now we meet every June 19th
We go and have a party at our favorite tree, hey
Hey!
Hey!
