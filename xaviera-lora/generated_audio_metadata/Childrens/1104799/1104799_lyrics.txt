I'm gonna draw a picture, I'll start with a great big face
I'll draw a circle with a big red pen with squiggles all over the place
I'll draw two eyes with a lovely blue, then scribble a nose of yellow
I'll give it a mouth of brilliant green, oh what a lovely fellow
I'll draw him on a bicycle riding down a hill
Holding a purple icicle
If he crashes who'll pay the bill
His ears are like an elephant's
His feet are like a rhino
I'll draw his teeth with polka dots
Will he like'em how do I know
His hat can be of chocolate cake
His shirt can be of parrot
His pants can be of licorice
His shoes can be of carrot
I'll draw him in the countryside
Where all the trees are blue
If I hold my picture upside down
You know it looks like you
I'm gonna draw a picture
I'll start with a great big face
I'll draw a circle with a big red pen
With squiggles all over the place
His ears are like an elephant's, his feet are like a rhino
I'll draw his teeth with polka dots, will he like'em? How do I know?
His hat can be of chocolate cake, his shirt can be of parrot
His pants can be of licorice, his shoes can be of carrot
I'll draw him in the countryside where all the trees are blue
If I hold my picture upside down you know it looks like you
I'm gonna draw a picture
I'll start with a great big face
I'll draw a circle with a big red pen
With squiggles all over the place
