Come on everybody, feel that groovin' beat
Low rhythm movin' down into your feet
Movin', groovin', movin' to the beat
Movin', groovin', can't stop those dancin' feet
Got those dance, dance, dance
Oh, dancin' feet, dancin' feet
Got those dance, dance, dance
Oh, dancin' feet
At school, on the playground, in your living room
We got the dance moves that anyone can do
So everybody get up off your seat
Follow me and we'll do the dancing feet
Got those dance, dance, dance
Oh, dancing feet, dancing feet
Got those dance, dance, dance
Oh, dancing feet
Young and old, no matter what your age
Let all the world become your stage
Listen up, you're in for a treat
Mama Mac's gonna teach you the dancing feet
Point your toes to the left
Now point your toes to the right
Back and forth, back and forth
Now zig zag, zig zag, faster
Point your toes to the left
Point your toes to the right
Back and forth, back and forth
Zig zag, zig zag
Point your toes to the left
Point your toes to the right
Back and forth, back and forth
Zig zag
Come on, dance, dance, dance
Oh, dance the beat, dance the beat
Got those dance, dance, dance
Yeah, dancing feet
Dance, dance, dance
Oh, dancing feet
Dance, dance, dance, oh, dance the beat (dance the beat)
Dance the beat, dance the beat
Dance the beat, dance the beat
Dance the beat, dance the beat
Dance the beat, dance the beat
