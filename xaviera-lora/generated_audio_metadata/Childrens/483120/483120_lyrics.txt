Splish splash splish, it's a whale shark fish
Got three thousand teeth in its head
Splish splash splish, swims and eats all day
You know big fishies gotta be fed
It likes yummy plankton, itty bitty fish
Squishy little squid, mmm what a tasty dish
Splish splash splish, it's a whale shark fish
The biggest fish you'll ever see
Slish splash slish it's a whale shark fish
Don't you know it's big as a bus?
Slish splash slish mouths four feet wide
Gentle and won't eat us
It has small eyes
Big fins can't hurt its feelings
Because it's got thick skin
Slish splash slish it's a whale shark fish
The biggest fish you'll ever see
[Outro]
Splish Splash Splish, it's a whale shark fish
Some people thought it laid eggs
Splish Splash Splish, can you believe it has three hundred babies instead
It swims in any ocean, moves side to side
Three miles an hour and on a very fast ride
Splish Splash Splish, it's a whale shark fish
The biggest fish you'll ever see
Splish splash splish, it's a whale shark fish
The biggest fish you'll ever see
