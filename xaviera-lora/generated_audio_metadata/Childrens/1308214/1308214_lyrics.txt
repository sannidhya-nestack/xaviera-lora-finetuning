We spread a blanket on soft summer grass
Watching white puffs gently drifting past
A turtle or a bunny shapes we spy
Giggles echo sweetly under the sky
Counting clouds, oh counting clouds
Up so high in puffy crowds
Counting clouds, oh counting clouds
Wonders shared where joy abounds
We wave at the breeze that rustles the trees
Imagining tales that flow with ease
Sunbeams softly play all around
In our cozy world bright treasures are found
Hold these wonders in your heart
Every day a brand new start
Counting clouds, oh counting clouds
Up so high in puffy crowds
Counting clouds, oh counting clouds
Wonders shared where joy abounds
Counting clouds, smiles on display
In each other's love we find our way
Counting cloud, smiles on display
In each other's love we find our way
