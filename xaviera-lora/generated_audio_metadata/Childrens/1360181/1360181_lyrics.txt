Tap tap toes on the bathroom floor
Splashy sounds silly a little more
Tiny hands and soapy seats
Laughing loud we squeeze knees
Bubbles up (pop)
Poppin' poppin' pop
Bubbles up
Bubbles up (bubble)
Bounce and bounce don't stop
Bubbles up
Bubbles up (go)
Poppin' poppin' pop
Bubbles up
Bubbles up
Bubbles up
Bubbles up
Pop, pop, everywhere
On your nose, in your hair
Pop, pop, floating by
Funny faces in the sky
Wiggly, giggly, twisty free
Bubbles dance with me
The hands just up and up and up they go
Who can touch a bubble? No
Up and up and up and whoa
Bubbles, bubbles up
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubbles pop and pop and pop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubbles bounce and bounce don't stop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubbles pop and pop and pop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Spin around, reach to the sky
Whisper wishes, giggles fly
Bubble magic everywhere
Catch a laugh, floating in the air
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubble pop, pop and pop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubble bounce and bounce don't stop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubble pop and pop and pop
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubble pops up, bubbles up
Bubbles up, bubbles up
Bubble pop and pop and pop
