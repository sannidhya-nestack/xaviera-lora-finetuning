If you look up in the sky
You're sure to see them out there
If you look up you will find
There's nothing in the night to fear
The lion and the bear
Have always been there
To shine over you
The lion and the bear
Have always been there
Shining over you
Twinkle, twinkle, there they are (Twinkle, twinkle, there they are)
Find them with your finger
Twinkle, twinkle, heaven's star
Where God has hid his creatures
The lion and the bear have always been there to shine over you
The lion and the bear have always been there shining over you
At the moment they were born
Who sang to their creator
He gave them names and made them glow
To show us all his favour
The lion and the bear
Have always been there
Shining over you
The lion and the bear
Have always been there
To shine over you
