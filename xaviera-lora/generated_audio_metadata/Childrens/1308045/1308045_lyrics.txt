We set sail on crispy seas
Pepperoni on the breeze
Cheese waves swirl and shimmer
Oh so tasty if you please
Our wooden spoon is ready
Sauce countess points the way
Every slice a treasure
That's how pirates like to play
Pizza pirates shouting loud
Cruising across in cheesy clouds
We're on course for savory gold
Pizza pirates brave and bold
Anchors down and mozzarella spices dancing on the deck
We hoot and holler all aboard each bite a tasty speck
Swords of basil gleam so bright oregano in the air
We chart our course with fearless hearts no flavor can compare
Across the doughy ocean wide
Full steam ahead we never hide
One shared slice and we all collide
In laughter bound by pirate pride
Oh, oh, feel that hearty hunger rise
Oh, oh, watch those toppings mesmerize
Pizza pirates, forever we roam
With sauce and cheese, we call it home
Raise a slice and let it be known
Pizza pirates reign alone
