Listen to me, listen to me
I want to tell you
What you mean to me
You are sunshine
You are rainbows
Warmth grows around you
When you're near to me
You're my life, day and night
Mommy's here to make things right
You can feel, you can see
What you mean to me
Listen to me
Hear what I say
I'm going to love you
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
