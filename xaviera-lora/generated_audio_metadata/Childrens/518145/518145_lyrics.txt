Elsie Molly is grown so fine
She won't get up to feed the swine
But lies in bed till eight or nine
And surely she does take her time

She won't get up to feed the swine
But lies in bed till eight or nine
And surely she does take her time
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Elsie Molly is grown so fine
She won't get up to feed the swine
But lies in bed till eight or nine
And surely she does take her time
Elsie Molly is grown so fine
She won't get up to feed the swine
But lies in bed till eight or nine
And surely she does take her time
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
