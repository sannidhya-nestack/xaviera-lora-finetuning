Can't wait for my birthday, all the gifts are mine
Ripin' open presents, two at a time
The goodies and gizmos and gadgets I get
All stuff in my closet and soon et
I got TVs and CDs and DVDs
Computers and cellphones, ten pairs of capris
That stuff's not enough
There's a whole lot more
It's the little things I should be thankful for
Like wind from my kite
A butterfly's flight
A really neat bug
And a friendly hug
A dog without fleas
A pile of fall leaves
Bubbles to blow
And a double rainbow
You've got to stop
And smell the roses
Just look around at all you've got
It's the little things
My school day's over but I'm not through
There's cheerleading practice and soccer to do
I come home tired and hungry as a bear
Open up the fridge to see what mom's left there
There's chicken fingers and mac and cheese
Apples and oranges and sugar cookies
Mom's really busy but took time you see
To do a little thing that meant a lot to me
It's like wind from my kite
A butterfly's flight
A really neat thug and a friendly hug
A dog without fleas, a pile of fall leaves
Bubbles to blow and a double rainbow
You've got to stop and smell the roses
Just look around at all you've got
It's the little things
It's the little things
