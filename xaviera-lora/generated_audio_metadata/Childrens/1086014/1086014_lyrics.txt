Getting down at my feet
They want to move to this beat
I watch them move and it makes me smile and I think I'll
Stay here a while
Together mix and slide across the floor
Watch one, two, three and four
They do the shim, shim, shimmy
They do the shim, shim, shimmy
They do, they do, they do, they do
They do the shim, shim, shimmy
Nice to have friends like you
It's like having brand new shoes
My feet tap, my toes bounce
friendships like ours really count
It's hard to find mates just like you
That can turn feet into happy rescue
They do the shim, shim, shimmy
They do the shim, shim, shimmy
They do, they do, they do, they do
They do the shimmy shimmy shimmy
