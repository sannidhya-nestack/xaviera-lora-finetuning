Leg up, bounce out, bend (let's go)
Wiggle my toes, stretch up high
Grab my socks and do a silly dance
Bounce like a ball, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce like a ball all through the house
Up and down, spin around, shout it out
Bounce like a ball, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce and see you
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce and bounce
Breakfast time, I bounce in my chair
Moon in the air, gable, who cares?
Jump and brittle shack my hair
Moon makes it better when you bounce everywhere
Bounce like a bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce like a ball all through the house
Up and down, spin around, shout it out
Bounce like a ball, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
If you're feeling bouncy let it show
Jump up high, go, go, go
With my friends and family too
We bounce together and laugh with you
Bounce like a ball, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce like a ball through the house
Up it got to the cash on up
Bounce like a ball, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, ball, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
And give it
Bounce, bounce
