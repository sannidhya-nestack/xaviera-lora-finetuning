It's a bright, sunshiny day
Relax and throw your cares away

These memories are for making (let's go)
Come on let's put one in a frame

Nothing but blue skies up and away (hey hey hey)
We got it all yeah we got it babe
It's a perfect day
To go outside and play
And have big big big big fun on a sunny day
Kick off your shoes, slip on your shades
Shift into cruise, today's your day
Come join the laughter and chillin'
Play back there's no better feelin'
While here's the only place to be
