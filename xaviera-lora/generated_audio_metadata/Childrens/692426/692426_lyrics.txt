Sometimes it feels too hard to fix
Like sailing with no sails on your ship
If you don't mind, I'd like to take you on a ride
Where we can work better together
Together we can find treasure
Together we can make worlds better
You and me together forever
You and me together
Skies shine bright with you by my side
With you I'm all smiles inside
Friendships like ours are the best part of me
Hope everyone has someone like you in the sea
Together we can find treasure
Together we can make worlds better
You and me together forever
Together we can find treasure
Together we can make worlds better
You and me
Together, forever
Together we can find treasure
Together we can make worlds better
You and me, together, forever
You and me, together
