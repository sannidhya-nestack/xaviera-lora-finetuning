Have you tried a coconut?
They're good for your brain and good for your gut
And there's so many ways you can eat them up, it's true
Have you tried a coconut?
They are a food I like a lot
Perhaps I'll eat a coconut with you
Coconuts are yummy, filling up your tummy
From the palm trees see them fall
When the sunlight reaches all the sandy beaches
They're up to thirty metres tall
And they have crossed the oceans
they kept on floating
So now they grow around the world
When they're too high for us to get them
The monkeys can collect them
Let's hope they're not for them to hurl
Have you tried a hot coconut?
They're good for your brain and good for your gut
And there's so many ways you can eat them up
It's true
Have you tried a coconut? They are a food I like a lot
Perhaps I'll eat a coconut with you
National Coconut Day is the 8th of May
Something that I never knew
When they're used on our skin, coconuts are healing
They help us feel all shiny and new
Sometimes coconut trees live longer than you or me
More than a hundred years
Whether used or eaten, they really can't be beaten
Let's give the coconut three cheers! (Yeah!)
The coconut
