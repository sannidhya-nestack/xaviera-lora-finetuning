Tell me, was there life before radio?
Tell me, wise old owl, surely you must know
My gen's right before what comes after Z
My world's virtual, that's reality
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
See are there drones or even cellphones?
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
Home
First thing that I know
Climate's changing fast
New cars on the road
Never needing gas
Is technology
Like a high speed train?
Last thing that I know
Updates come in waves
Change after change
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
See are there drones or even cellphones?
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
And see if we still call earth home
Each generation thinks change is rough
But the tech world needs the human touch
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
See either drones or even cell phones
I'd like to live to three hundred years old
And see if we still call her home
And see if we still call Earth home
