Cleaning up your room doesn't have to be work
If you clean along with this song, it can be fun
My room's a mess, mom says get it clean
That makes me mad, I think she's mean
I could whistle and work, or grumble and complain
It doesn't matter, gotta do it just the same
Gotta make it fun, gotta get it done
If I finish quick, I can play and run
Do the clean up boogie, the clean up boogie
Do the clean up boogie
The clean up boogie
Yeah
Now you got it
Jitter with my pillow
Tangle with my sheet
Hurry up fast
Make this room neat
Shut the door
Grab the toys off the floor
Twist to the toy box behind the door
Take the dust mop
Make it cha-cha all around
Make it clean up high
Make it boogie on the ground
Do the clean up boogie
The clean up boogie
Do the clean up boogie
The Clean Up Boogie!
Yeah, down!
Shake them up to the left, shake them up to the right
Sweep those cobwebs out of sight
Smooth out the covers, clean up the shelf
Almost finished, I did it all myself
If you dance while you clean, it makes your work light
Then mom's real happy, your room's a cool sight
Do the Clean Up Boogie!
The clean up boogie
Do the clean up boogie
The clean up boogie
Do the clean up boogie
The clean up boogie
Do the clean up boogie
The clean up boogie
Yeah, we're all done
