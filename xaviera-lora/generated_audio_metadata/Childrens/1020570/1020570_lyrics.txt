Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat, gently up the creek
If you see a little mouse don't et to squeak
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
If you see a crocodile
Don't et to scream
Row, row, row your boat
Gently through the shore
If you see a lion
Don't et to roar
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat
Gently up the creek
If you see a little mouse
Don't et to squeak
Row, row, row your boat
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream
If you see a crocodile, don't et to scream
Row, row, row your boat, gently through the shore
If you see a lion, don't et to roar
