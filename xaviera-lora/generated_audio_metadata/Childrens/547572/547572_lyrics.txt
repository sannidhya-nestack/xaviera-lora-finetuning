I'll hold you in my arms tonight
Your face so new and calm
Your little hand is strong and firm
Wrapped around my thumb
I'll sing a song my mother sang
When I was just your size
Of clowns and trains and purple moons
And angels who can fly
Go to sleep in daddy's arms
Daddy's arms, daddy's arms
Go to sleep now don't you cry
In daddy's arms tonight
I'll lay you down so quietly
And watch you for a while
And wonder what you will be like
When you're no longer a child
Now you're daddy's little one
And I love you more than words
You have your mother's pretty smile
And your daddy's funny nose
So go to sleep in daddy's arms
Daddy's arms, daddy's arms
Go to sleep, now don't you cry
In daddy's arms tonight
