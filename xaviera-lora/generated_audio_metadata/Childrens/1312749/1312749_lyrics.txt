You can fly way up high like a bird in the sky
Ride a rainbow and find where you came from
With your feet on the ground you can soar through the clouds
All you need is imagination
You could go to the moon on a big red balloon
In a bright silver suit like an alien
And eat green cheese with the moon kids you meet
All you need is imagination
Close your eyes, throw your arms out wide
And picture what you want to do
A box is a castle, a towel's a cape
A ruler's a wand, it's up to you
Would you like to explore the deep ocean floor
See the fish and the whales and crustaceans
In your own submarine you can watch everything
All you need is imagination
If you rode on a horse with a shield and a sword
And rescued a lost fair maiden
To repay what you did she could grant you a wish
All you need is imagination
Close your eyes
Throw your arms out wide
And picture what you want to do
A stool is a spaceship
Two chairs are a plane
A pen is a drum
It's up to you
You can lead the way in your own parade
On a float that's shaped like a dragon
Marching right behind are a million fireflies
All you need is imagination
All you need is imagination
All you need is imagination
