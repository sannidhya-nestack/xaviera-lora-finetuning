They are a round juicy fruit Also known as a drupe
With a hard heart stone inside
But they're lovely to eat
they're soft and they're sweet
With a skin like velvet outside
You know originally
They're from China, you see
Where they grow half the world's supply
And from the trees they are plucked
As a symbol of luck
And there's two thousand types you can try
If there's a peach, peach, peach in my reach, reach, reach
I'll have each, each, each one I can
If there's a peach, peach, peach in reach, reach, reach
Of that peach, peach, peach I'm a fan
If there's a peach, peach, peach in me reach, reach, reach
I would eat, eat, eat it up fast
If there's a peach, peach, peach in my reach, reach, reach
It's a treat, treat, treat that won't last
Sometimes you'll hear people say
You look peachy today
Well that phrase came from Roman times
Why a peach? I don't know, but it's the fruit that they chose to mean you look or feel rather fine
The peach contains vitamins which are good for our skin and can help us to have healthy eyes
So if I said I'd like more of this fruit I adore, I am sure that you won't be surprised
If there's a peach, peach, peach in my reach, reach, reach
I'll have each, each, each one I can
If there's a peach, peach, peach in reach, reach, reach
Of that peach, peach, peach I'm a fan
If there's a peach, peach, peach in me reach, reach, reach
I would eat, eat, eat it up fast
If there's a peach, peach, peach in my reach, reach, reach
It's a treat, treat, treat that won't last
