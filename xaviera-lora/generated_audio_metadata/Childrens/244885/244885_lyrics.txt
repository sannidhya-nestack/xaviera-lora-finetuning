One little fish all alone swam in the ocean blue
Then the one little fish made a friend
One plus one makes two
The two little fish went south for the winter
Toward the warm waters of the sea
There they met another little fish
Two plus one makes three
Sweet oh sweet the three little fish
Shot tight of the deep headed toward the shore
Along the way they were joined by another
Three plus one makes four
The four little fish took in the sights
Decided to go for a dive
They bumped into another little fish
Four plus one makes five
The five little fish were chased by a shark
Got into a fix
During their escape they found a new mate
Five plus one makes six
Six eggs makes when the six little fish were safe
They looked up to the heavens
Once they were secure they picked up one more
Six plus one makes seven
The seven little fish saw hooks in the water
But they did not like the bait
They grabbed the little fish, about to take a bite
Seven plus one makes eight, the eighth little fish
Followed the current, swimming in a line
A little fish asked to tag along
Eight plus one makes nine (oh so fine)
The nine little fish laughed and played
Became the best of friends
Asked the sad little fish to join in the fun
Nine plus one makes ten
The ten little fish live happy ever after in the ocean blue
If they had but one wish
It would be that you would be there too
That they could swim with you
Kunambo
