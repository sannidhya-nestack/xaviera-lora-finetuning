Wiggly walk in spotty socks
Guffaws echo as we rock
Leaping, twirling upside down
Cheering loud from town to town
Hey, hey, let's laugh and play
Shimmy left and jump away
Hands in the air, it's quite a show
Snapping fingers as we go
Hey, hey, let's laugh and play
Join the fun, let's sway, sway, sway
Nonsense words we like to shout
Silly puns that float about
Tickled toes and wobbly knees
Waltzing through these oddities
Close your eyes and spin around
Catch your breath when you hit the ground
Mixing stripes with polka dots
Bouncing tunes in tangled knots
Giggling mischief in the air
Every friend is free to share
Hey, hey, let's laugh and play
Shimmy left and jump away
Hands in the air, it's quite a show
Snapping fingers as we go
Hey, hey, let's laugh and play
Join the fun, let's sway
Sway, sway, sway, we'll keep this tune inside our heads
Wacky fun wherever it spreads
