Five little ducks went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Mama duck said, "Quack, quack, quack !"
And only four little ducks came swimming back
Four little ducks went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Mama duck said, "Quack, quack, quack !"
And only three little ducks came swimming back
Three little ducks went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Mama duck said, "Quack, quack, quack"
And only two little ducks came swimming back
Two little ducks went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Wama duck said (quack, quack, quack)
And only one little duck came swimming back
One little duck went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Mama duck said, "Quack, quack, quack !"
And no little duck came swimming back
Daddy Duck went swimming one day
Over the pond and far away
Daddy Duck said, "Quack, quack, quack"
And five little ducks came swimming back
(Duck Quacking)
