Wouldn't you like to visit Cinderella
Hold a feather in your hand and fly?
You could have some breakfast with the charming prince
And watch the fairy godmother stroll by
Wouldn't you like to spend some time in the snow white?
Hop a little hopscotch in the stars
You could shake the hands of the southern dwarves
And watch'em drive away in southern cars
Night time, bedtime
Close your eyes
Night time, right time
That's where the young girl flies
Wouldn't you like to visit Sleeping Beauty
That would be the friendly thing to do
Close your eyes and think of Sleeping Beauty
Maybe she will come and visit you
Wouldn't you like to lose a sleeping beauty?
That would be the friendly thing to do
Close your eyes and think of sleeping beauty
Maybe she will come and visit you
Close your eyes and think of sleeping beauty
Maybe she will come and visit you
