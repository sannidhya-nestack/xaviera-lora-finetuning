Can't see the Sandman'cause he comes to you at night
Can't see the Sandman'cause he's keeping out a sign
Underneath your pillow, underneath the bed
And if you're really quiet, you just might hear him laugh
Can't catch a sandman,'cause he's really much too small
Can't catch a sandman, so I wouldn't try at all
He is of course quite friendly, but he's so very shy
He comes to bring the sweet dream, with his moon dust in your eyes
Can't find the Sandman when you wake up to the sun
Can't find the Sandman'cause his sleepy work is done
But when the day is over, you're safely tucked in bed
He'll be there just in time to put a sweet dream in your head
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
