We're sailing out to sea and Captain Bligh is at the wheel
The wind is in our sails and now we're on an even keel
The kids have come home safely and have joined us on our trip
Aboard the finest vessel, yes, the salty dogs our ship
It's Christmas, yes, it's Christmas for it's Christmas, Christmas time
We're sailing the mighty ocean and we're having a wonderful ride
The ship's bell rings out loudly so that everyone can hear
The party's on the poop deck and we're full of party cheer
There's one time of the year when pirates like to have time off
To fill their hungry tummies full of wholesome festive scoff
The group goes down the hatch and then we do a merry dance
If we carry on being careless we could find ourselves in France
It's Christmas, yes, it's Christmas, for it's Christmas, Christmas time
With pirates through and through with a reputation far and wide
The ship's bell rings out loudly so that everyone can hear
The party's on the poop deck and we're full of hearty cheer
A snowman melts so quickly and the time goes by so fast
Christmas of the future and'tis Christmas of the past
All melded into one into the best times of our lives
There's nothing like the present as we say it and do the dive
It's Christmas, truly Christmas, for it's Christmas, Christmas time
We're sailing the mighty ocean and we're having a wonderful ride
The ship's bell rings out loudly so that everyone can hear
The party's on the roof deck and we're full of hearty cheer
It's Christmas, yes it's Christmas for it's Christmas, Christmas time
We're pirates through and through with a reputation far and wide
The ship bells ring out loudly so that everyone can hear
The party's on the poop deck and we're full of heart and cheer
It's Christmas, truly Christmas for it's Christmas, Christmas time
We're sailing the mighty ocean and we're having a wonderful ride
The ship bells ring out loudly so that everyone can hear
The party's on, let's move that kiss, the best time of the year!
