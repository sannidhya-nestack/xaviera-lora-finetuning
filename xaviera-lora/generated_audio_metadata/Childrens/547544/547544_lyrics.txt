Okay everybody, turn on your fast button for this song
We start out slow but the song gets faster and faster
See if you can keep up with me, here we go!
Down by the bay where the watermelons grow
Back to my home I dare not go
For if I do my mother will say
Did you ever see a goose kissing a moose
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
Did you ever see a whale with a polka dot tail
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
Did you ever see a fly wearing a tie?
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do, my mother will say
Did you ever see a bear, combing his hair
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
Did you ever see a frog, walking his dog
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow, back to my home
I dare not go, for if I do, my mother will say
Did you ever see a mouse painting a house?
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow, back to my home
I dare not go, for if I do, My mother will say
Did you ever see a fish spinning a dish
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home I dare not go
For if I do my mother will say
Did you ever have a time where you couldn't make a rhyme
Down by the bay, down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home, I dare not go
For if I do, my mother will say
Did you ever see a goose kissing a moose?
Did you ever see a whale with a polka dot tail?
Did you ever see a fly wearing a tie?
Did you ever see a bear combing his hair?
Oh my goodness!
Did you ever see a frog walking a dog?
Did you ever see a mouse painting a house?
Did you ever see a fish spinning a dish?
Did you ever have the time where you couldn't make a rhyme?
Down by the bay
To be
Well did ya?
