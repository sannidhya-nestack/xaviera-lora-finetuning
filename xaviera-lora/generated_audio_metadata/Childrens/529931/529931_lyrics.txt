Go to sleep, rest your head
I'll be here awhile
When morning comes, sleep ahead
Then you'll wake and smile
But if it gets too hard
I don't cry
And if you do I'll kiss those tears goodbye
And I'll be there
Watching you dream sweet dreams
Go to sleep once again
It isn't hard to do
When morning comes
Only then, all your dreams come true
And if it gets too hard, I don't cry
And if you do, I'll kiss those tears goodbye
I'll be there watching you dream sweet dreams
Dream of fish beneath the waves
And stars up in the sky
And wispy winds that blow the clouds so high
And you'll fall away too
Leave today
On its way, morning's coming by
And if it gets too hard, I don't cry
But if you do, I'll kiss those tears goodbye
And I'll be there
Watching you dream, I'll be there
Watching you dream, I'll be there
Watching you dream, sweet dreams
