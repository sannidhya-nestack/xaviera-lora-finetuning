Paint me an angel, the colours of love
Mixed with the earth and the sky above
Paint me an angel so I can see
The colours of love all around me
Paint with the beat of a happy heart
And the scent of your favorite flower
Paint with the notes of a silver flute
And the cool of an April shower
Paint with the warmth of the sun on your face
And the smile a rainbow can bring
Paint with the wind in the leafy green trees
And the song of a robin in spring
Paint me an angel, the colours of love
Mixed with the earth and the sky above
Paint me an angel so I can see
The colours of love all around me
