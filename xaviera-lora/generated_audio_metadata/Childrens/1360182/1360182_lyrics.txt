Morning giggles, socks slip and slide
Chasing light through the sunbeam tide
Something's twinkling just outside (just outside)
Little heart jumping, can't hide the pride
Tiny shoes, zigzag zoom (zigzag zoom)
Tiptoe quick to every room
Step by step, little leaps, big grins
Big grins
Round and round the fun begins
Spin and skipping side by side
I'll get cheering arms open wide
Let's clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Step by step, don't stop, hey
Sun hats, corrupted, silly song sung
Wiggling fingers counting on one
Tumbles and giggles
Wins for everyone (everyone)
Loud and proud, our race just begun
Fancy feet (feet)
Hop hop zoom (hop hop zoom)
Friendly faces below
Step by step, little leaps, big grins
Laugh, I'll be dense
Round and round, the fun begins
Spin and skipping, side by side
I'll be cheering, arms open wide
Let's bop, bop, bop, bop, bap
Step by step, don't stop, hey
If you stumble, I'll help you stand (You got it, you can)
Shout it loud, clap your hands (Clap your hands)
Step by step, little leaps, big grins
Round and round, the fun begins
Round and round, the fun begins
Spin and skipping, side by side
I'll be cheering, arms open wide
Everyone, step by step, don't stop
Big smiles, let's go
