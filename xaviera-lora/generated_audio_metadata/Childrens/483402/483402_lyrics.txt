Evangeline, is this what you mean? Well you can detour, but don't damn the river
As I try to follow, one step behind her, but you chose to love her
This one or the other, bullets are flying, which side of the river are you standing?
When sides are choosing, what does it matter if I am losing?
Pretty girls have long hair and they drive pickup trucks
Mercedes Benz or Rolls Royce
It's their choice, it depends
So I turn on the radio
Down here on the bio
when the lady bird touches down
On an oil drilling town in those calm Gulf waters
You better not mess around when the hurricane comes down
In those rough Gulf waters
My Delta D, what you mean to me and what you were to be
Pitch silhouette against the dark night sea
So I turn on the raid video
Down here on the bio
when the lady bird touches down on an oil drilling town
In those calm Gulf waters
You better not mess around where the hurricane comes down
On those rough Gulf waters
My Delta D what you mean to me and what you were to be
Bitch silhouette against the dark night sea
