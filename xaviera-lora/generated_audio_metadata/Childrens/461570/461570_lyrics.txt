I love little Pussy, her coat is so warm
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm
I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away
But Pussy and I very gently will play
I love little Pussy, her coat is so warm
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm
I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away
For Pussy and I very gently will play
I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away
The pussy and I very gently will play
