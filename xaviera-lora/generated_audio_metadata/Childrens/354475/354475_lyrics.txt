Everybody jump up now turn around
Quickly do a back tuck and put your feet on the ground
Look left and right now get ready to put on a show
The crowd's cheering for you ready to shout woah
Up and down, now spin around, it is a locomotion
Back, turn, split, flip and twirl, let's get into action
Stop now, jump and move around, everybody's cheering
Run, run, run, it is so fun, what a great feeling
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Everybody swing high, now bend low
Smile ear to ear, fast stand on your toes
Look left and right now, get ready to put on a show
The crowd's cheering for you, ready to shout woah
