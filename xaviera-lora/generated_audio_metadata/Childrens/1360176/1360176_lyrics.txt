Wake up, it's a sunny day
I put on my hat and say, hooray!
I stretch my arms so big and wide
What surprises will today provide?
Will we laugh or will we play?
Every moment hooray, hooray!
Let's make a parade
Hip hooray, marching down the lane
Stomping feet and clapping hands in the sunshine or the rain
Wave your flags and hats today
We're making happy memories along the way
Let's go!
Neighbors peak, enjoying the fun
Balloons and ribbons for everyone
Drums go boom, and bells go ding
Come along let's dance and sing (hey)
Who we meet, what games we'll play
Side by side, hooray (hooray)
Let's make a parade
Take a parade, marching down the lane
Stomping feet and clapping hands in the sunshine or the rain
Wave your flags and hats today
We're making happy memories along the way
Everyone's included, peps and teddy bears
We're louder than a thunder cloud, but nobody cares
Let's twirl and spin, let's jump and hop
Our joyful parade will never stop
I'm the leader of the band, see my shiny baton
Friends from every house come marching along
Step to the beat, high knees in the street
Every face I meet is a friend I greet
Colors in the air, music everywhere
We sparkle with cheer, we share and we care
Hey little duck, come join the crew
There's always a spot here for you
And you and you, let's make a parade
Let's make a parade, marching down the lane
Stomping feet and clapping hands, in the sunshine or the rain
Wave your flags and hats today, we're making memories along the way
Step by step with friends we go, every parade needs friends you know
March along we're never blue, our happy parade goes on and on with you
With you, with you
