It's a wonderful day today, such a wonderful day today
Not a cloud in the sky, feels great to be alive
Hey, it's a wonderful day
Well, I woke up, I was singing
The birds seemed to join right in
Got no plans to keep feeling totally free
Let the day begin
Outside people laughing, playing in the sun
Today's a day we'll remember just made for having fun
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
It's a wonderful day today
Such a wonderful day today
Not a cloud in the sky
Feels great to be alive
What a wonderful day, what a wonderful day
It's a wonderful day
Just can't keep from smiling
Hello to all I meet
The whole world starts to move in time
Feel like dancing down the street
It's a wonderful day
It's a wonderful day, it's a wonderful day today (it's a wonderful day, it's a wonderful day, it's a wonderful day) (it's a wonderful day, it's a wonderful day)
