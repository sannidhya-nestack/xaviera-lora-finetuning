Do you like bugs? Do you like to dance?
Let's put them together and do the kitty bug bop
Come on kids, let's do the bug bop
Once you start dancing, you cannot stop
Wiggle your bods all around the block
Start off slow, tap your toe
Once you get going, you'll really know
It's lots of fun
Ready set go
Stomp your feet
Make a big noise
Wiggle your hips
You girls and boys
Shake your arms like rag doll toys
Come on kids
Let's do the bug bop
Once you start dancing
You cannot stop
Wiggle your body all around the block
Come on kids (come on kids) let's do the bug-bop (bug-bop)
One star dancing, you cannot stop (boop, boop, boop, boop)
Wheel your body around the block
Clap your hands and make a loud beat
Click your tongues, it sure sounds neat
It'll catch on up and down the street
Slap the floor, slap your knees
Flap your wings like buzzing bees
Dance around like hopping fleas
Come on kids, let's do the bug bop
Once you start dancing you cannot stop
Wiggle your butts all around the block
