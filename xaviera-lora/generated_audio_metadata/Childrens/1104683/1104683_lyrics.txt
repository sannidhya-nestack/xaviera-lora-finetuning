Has anybody here seen Blue Dog
Blue Dog with the great big snout
If you seen my Blue Dog
You better give a great big shout
Oi, has anybody here seen Blue Dog
Blue Dog with the big blue pores
I haven't seen my Blue Dog since he ran out the door
Blue Dog had his breakfast with corn flakes and toast
He likes his toast with marmalade, he thinks that it's the most
Then he read the newspaper and stretched his long blue tail
That was when he told me he was gonna fetch the mail
Has anybody here seen Blue Dog, Blue Dog with the great big snout
If you've seen my Blue Dog you'd better give a great big shout
Oi, has anybody here seen Blue Dog, Blue Dog with the big black porous
I haven't seen my Blue Dog since he ran out the door
Blue Dog wears an overcoat with buttons on the sleeves
He always takes his big black hat every time he leaves
Blue Dog wears his gumboots and his favorite yellow scarf
If he looks in the mirror you should hear him laugh
Has anybody here seen Blue Dog
Blue Dog with the great big snout
If you've seen my blue dog, you better give a great big shout
Oi, has anybody here seen Blue Dog? Blue Dog with the big black pores
I haven't seen my Blue Dog since he ran out the door
I can see my Blue Dog coming home for tea
He likes baked beans but not tonight, he's coming home to me
We'll have the chicken casserole and pancakes for dessert
He went to town to see a band with his old friend Green Dog Bert
