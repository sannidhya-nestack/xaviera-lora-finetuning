Here come some Martians, they look a little green
But hey, so does everyone who drives a machine like theirs
It's a rocket ship and it's painted pink
I told'em they could park it in the kitchen sink
Now here comes Santa Claus, I don't know why
Didn't anybody tell'em it's the Fourth of July?
Hey, sit down Santa
I'll get some water to drink
Oh whoops
There's a rocket in the kitchen sink
You leave your back door open
Yes ma'am
Leave your back door open
Open wide
Leave your back door open
Listen sister and ya
Never know who might step inside
Now here comes
Goldilocks and Captain Hook
You've seen him in the movies
You've seen her in the book
Say where, says Goldie
Can I wash my hair?
I tried the kitchen sink
But there's a rocket in there
Leave your back door open
Yes, ma'am
Leave your back door open
Why leave your back door open?
Listen sister,'cause you never know who might step inside
Now here comes my mama, what could she think?
There's a sleigh on the lawn and a rocket in the sink
But she looks at my visitors and she gives'em a wink
And we dance up the chimney, dance up the stairs
Dancing on the rooftop, do the who cares
Dancing all night, dancing all day
Then I hear my mama say leave your back door open
Yes ma'am leave your back door open
Open wide, leave your back door open
Listen sister,'cause you never know who might step inside
Leave your back door open, yes ma'am
Leave your back door open
Open wide, leave your back door open
Listen sister,'cause you never know who might step inside
