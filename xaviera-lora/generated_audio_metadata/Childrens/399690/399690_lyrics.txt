Hey kids, let's do an Irish jig!
Dance with me, get out of your seat
Clap your hands, kick up your feet
Grab your friends, swing round and round
Whirl and twirl to the musical sound
Dance with me, get out of your seat
Clap your hands, kick up your feet
Grab your friends, swing round and round
Whirl and twirl to the musical sound
Tap your heel, tap your toe
Dancing feet go to and fro
Tap your heel, tap your toe
Dancing feet go to and fro
Tap your heel, tap your toe
Dancing feet go to and fro
Tap your heel, tap your toe
Dancing feet go to and fro
Dance with me, get out of your seat
Clap your hands, kick up your feet
Grab your friends, swing round and round
