And the dog woke up from his nap and he said
I don't wanna chase a cat today
And he scratched a little and he shook his head
Said I don't wanna chase a cat today
In fact, I don't ever wanna chase that cat
Why does everybody think I'm crazy like that?
Day I'm gonna put on a different hat
I'm not gonna chase a cat today
And I'll shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot everybody, shoot, shoot
Shoo, shoo-a-dee, the cap said now that you mention it
I don't want to chase a mouse today
Yes, I'm tired of the running and the scary action
I don't want to chase a mouse today
In fact, I never really liked chasing mice
I frankly never thought it was all that nice
Today I'm gonna let'em run past me twice
I'm not gonna chase'em'bout today
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot everybody, shoot, shoot
Shoo, shoo Eddie
And the mouse when she heard what was going on
Said I don't wanna chase a lady today (I don't wanna chase a lady)
And she liked it, yeah she liked the idea
I'm not gonna chase a lady today (I'm not gonna chase a lady)
I hate to see her running'round the place
Jumping on chairs, getting red in the face
I think I'll stop bothering the human race
And we won't chase the lady today
No shoot shoot
Shoot shoot lady buddy
Shoot shoot
So the cat, dog, mouse and the lady too
They smiled at each other, said "How do you do?"
And now let's shake hands for goodness sake
Or let's shake paws or whatever you shake
Because nobody's chasing nobody
Nobody's chasing nobody
Nobody's chasing nobody today
And you could hear him singin' a shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo-waddy-waddy, shoo, shoo, shoo-shoo-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoo-shoot-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoot-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoot-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoot-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoot-waddy-waddy, shoot, shoot, shoot-waddy-waddy.
