We're the Coast Guards
Pirates and smugglers beware
We're employed in honourable duty
By the honourable Scotland Guard
We have the law of the country
And on cliff docks we're on guard
For suspicious looking gentlemen
Who carry out smuggling acts
Us poor old lonely glismen
In our waterproof coats are gone max
We're the force of good old England
We work with our own bare hands
And if we should (if we should) if we should (if we should)
See a pirate band
We'll protect all the children of the land
When our feet are growing colder while in stormy weather stood
We'll carry out our duty in our uniform of mud
By the end of the day we look like washed out sewer rats
Us poor old lonely policemen in our waterproof ghost guard hats
We're the force of good old England
We work with our own bare hands
And if we should (if we should) if we should (if we should)
See a pirate band
We'll protect all the children of the land
So before you join the force, young man, you'd better think some more
The problems we encounter when we represent the law
We can't make friends with cutthroats or those crafty smuggling folk
Who'd wanna make friends with cutthroats or them crafty smuggling folk anyway, eh?
Uh, indeed so, no, no, no, no, absolutely not
Perhaps it's for the best we wear the waterproof Coast Guard cloak
We're the force of good old England
We work with our own bare hands
And if we should (if we should) if we should (if we should)
See a pirate band
We'll protect all the children of the land
