They can't tell what they need
They can't dance, they can't read
That's why babies cry
Babies can't get out of bed
Trying to move above their head
That's why babies cry
They can't tell you what they need
They can't dance, they can't read
That's why babies cry
Have to tie them in their chair
So they won't slip out of there
That's why babies cry
'Cause they can't tell you what they need
They can't dance, they can't read
That's why babies cry
Kinda soggy underneath
Got no hair, got no teeth
That's why babies cry
They can't tell you what they need
They can't dance, they can't read
That's why bears cry
'Cause they can't tell you what they need
They can't dance, they can't read
And that's why babies cry
Yeah, that's why babies cry
