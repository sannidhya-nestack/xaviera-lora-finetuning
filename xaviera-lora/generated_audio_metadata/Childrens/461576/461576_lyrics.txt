On Saturday night, I lost my wife
And where do you think I found her?
Up in the moon, singing a tune
With all the stars around her
On Saturday night, I lost my wife
Where do you think I found her?
Up in the moon, singing a tune
With all the stars around her
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-d
On Saturday night I lost my wife
Where do you think I found her?
Up in the moon and singing a tune
With all the stars around her
