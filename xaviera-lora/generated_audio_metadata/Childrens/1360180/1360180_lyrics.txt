I woke up with the sunlight peeking in my room
Pulled on my brightest socks and hurry to the tune
Left foot, right foot, wait, what's this I see?
My socks are switched, oh, how silly can I be?
Oh, look at my toes all wiggly and wild
Every step's a giggle, every wiggle's a smile
Oops, my socks switched sides, what a funny surprise
I'm dancing down the hallway, socks on the wrong way
Oops, my socks switched sides, let's leap and let's slide
When you find a little mix-up, let's laugh and play
I tell my friends and everyone spins around
We all check our socks with a hop and a bound
Left is on the right, right is on the left
But nobody's worried, let's start the silly steps
Wiggling and giggling, twisting and twirling
Mistakes make magic when the world's whirling, oops
My socks switch sides, what a funny surprise
I'm dancing down the hallway, socks on the wrong way, oops
My socks switch sides, let's leap and let's slide
When you find a little mix up, let's lap and play
Everybody in a line, show your socks off high
Doesn't matter how they're worn, give it a try
(Longer right, just give it a try)
Left, right, wrong way, no reason to hide
Knicks ups make the best days, come on don't be shy (oops)
My socks switch sides, what a funny surprise
I'm dancing down the hallway, socks on the wrong way (oops)
My socks switch sides, let's leap and let's slide
So if you get your socks mixed up this morning too
Sing our silly song and giggle with your crew
