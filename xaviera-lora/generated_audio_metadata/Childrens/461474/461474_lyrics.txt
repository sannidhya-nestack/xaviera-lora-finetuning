He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds lightning just might be his rune
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
He got a big balloon at the county fair
And when our Jimmy grabbed it, he rose up in the air
A bright red piece of rubber with helium inside
We dove to grab his ankles, "Come back here, Jim," we cried
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds, lightning just might be his rune
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
But off he went so swiftly above the tallest trees
He clutched the string more tightly got caught up by a breeze
We got reports and sightings across the USA
They saw him in Des Moines he flew through Tampa Bay
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds like it just might be his rule
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
They wave to him in Boston, he whisked right through Detroit
He picked up Smog and Gary, we lost him in Beloit
It rained on him in Memphis and snowed hard in St. Paul
He's headed for the border, he'll visit Montreal
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds lightning just might be his rune
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds lightning just might be his room
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
I bet he's getting hungry, I bet he's getting cold
I bet that he is thinking this flying's getting old
Now you may think he's lucky and wish that you were there
But think how Jimmy's landing when he runs out of air
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds like it just might be his rune
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
He's off on an adventure we don't think we'll see him soon
Floating through the air on Jimmy's big balloon
He's drifting through the clouds lightning just might be his room
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
Way up in the atmosphere in Jimmy's big balloon
