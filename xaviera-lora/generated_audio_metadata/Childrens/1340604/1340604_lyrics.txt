Step, step, step in line
It's our happy school time
Clap, clap, clap along
Sing our back to school song
Hello friends, how are you?
We've got lots of things to do
March together, one, two, three
School is where we love to be
Books and crayons paint so bright
Learning colors, shapes, and light
Smiles and laughter, filthing air
School is fun when friends are there
