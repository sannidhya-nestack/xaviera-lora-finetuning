I've got everything I need, right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch and a piece of string, right here in my pocket
I've got everything I need, right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch and a piece of string
A crocodile tooth and a plastic ring, right here in my pocket
I've got everything I need
Right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch and a piece of string
A crocodile tooth and a plastic ring
Marbles, rocks and a beetle's wing
Right here in my pocket
I've got everything I need
Right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch and a piece of string
A crocodile tooth and a plastic ring
Marbles, rocks and a beetle's wing
A compass, map and a bottle of drink
Right here in my pocket
Sometimes when I walk to school I'll find some little treasure
I'll stick it in my pocket and I'll look at it for pleasure
I've got everything I need right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch and a piece of string
A crocodile tooth and a plastic ring
Marbles, rocks and a beetle's wing
A compass, map and a bottle of drink
A tortoise shell and a pencil I think
Right here in my pocket
Sometimes when I walk to school I'll find some little treasure
I'll stick it in my pocket and I'll look at it for pleasure
I've got everything I need right here in my pocket
I've got my lunch at a piece of string
A crocodile tooth at a plastic ring
Marbles, rocks and a beetle's wing
A compass, map and a bottle of drink
A tortoise shell and a pencil I think
An apple core and isopostics
Chewing gum and magic tricks
All shoenails and a couple of bricks
Right here in my pocket
Hey mate!
What?
Your pants are falling down
