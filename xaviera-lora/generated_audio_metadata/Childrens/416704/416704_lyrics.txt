Have you ever danced out in the moonlight? These children did, and boy did they have fun!
We're dancing in the moonlight, shining all around
We're swinging with the planets, we're rocking on the ground
We're smiling at the big moon, shining in the sky
We're doing the moonrock, the moonrock lullaby
Stars are a-twinkling, fireflies too
Come and join our moon rock dance, we wanna dance with you
Just shake your little hips and clap those happy hands
You're swinging with the planets
Don't you feel just grand (ooh)
We're dancing in moonlight
Shining all around
We're swinging with the planets
We're rocking on the ground
We're smiling at the big moon
Shining in the sky
We're doing the moon rock
The moon rock lullaby
Oh, Mama's calling, Daddy's at the door
But you don't wanna go to bed, you wanna rock some more
So blink those sleepy eyes, cover up that yawn
The moon rock lullaby is rocking on and on
We're dancing in moonlight, shining all around
We're swinging with planets, we're rocking on the ground
We're smiling at the moon
Shining in the sky
We're doing the moon rock
The moon rock lullaby
We're dancing in the moonlight
Shining all around
We're swinging with the planet
We're rocking on the ground
We're smiling at the big moon
Shining in the sky
We're doing the moon rock
The moon rock lullaby
