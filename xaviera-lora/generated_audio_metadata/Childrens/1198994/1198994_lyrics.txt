If I were a sunflower, here is what I'd do
I'd be my brightest yellow, to glow my love for you
If I were an oak tree, here is what I'd do
I'd showcase leaves the richest green, to grow my love for you
If I were a red rose, here is what I'd do
I'd carefully handle all my thorns to prove my love for you
If I were a dragonfly, here is what I'd do
I'd dance and fly and flit around to groove my love for you
If I were a cheetah, here is what I would do
I'd run as fast as I could go to bestow my love to you
If I were a lightning bug, here is what I'd do
I'd flicker bright and flash my light to flow my love for you
If I were a tree frog, here is what I'd do
I'd hop as high as I could leap to bring my love to you
If I were a hummingbird, here is what I'd do
I'd hum all day and every night to sing my love for you
If I were a house cat, here is what I'd do
I'd purr real loud and swish my tail
To show my love for you
If I were a donkey, here is what I'd do
I'd bray all day just to say
I know my love for you
If I were a flying squirrel, here is what I'd do
I'd leap from branch to highest branch
To give my love to you
But I'm just a human, and here is what I'll do
I'll kiss your cheeks and hug you tight
To live my love for you
