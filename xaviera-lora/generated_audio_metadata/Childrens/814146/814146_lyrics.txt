I like the earth
I like climbing trees
Jump rope with friends
Little morning breeze
Draw a sunflower
I like the earth
Let's ride a horse
Let's go to the zoo
Blow bubbles as we go
So much we can do
Lying in the grass
I like the earth
Sunny or stormy
Perfect weather for me
Cloudy or skies of
I like the earth
Never black and white
Colours uncountable
Day or deepest night
Tonight I'll sleep outside
I like the earth
Sunny or stormy
Perfect weather for me
Cloudy or skies of blue
You could get into
A rocket ship and zoom
Right to the moon but dude
Still miss the earth
Chasing butterflies
I love the earth
