Five little soldiers didn't want a war
One went home and then there were four
Four little soldiers crawling on their knees
One went home and then there were three
Sound off, one, two, sound off, three, four
Sound off, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four
Three little soldiers walking in the zoo
One went home and then there were two
Two little soldiers playing in the sun
One went home and then there was one
One little soldier looking for some fun
He went home and then there were none
Sound off one two sound off three four
Sound off one two three four one two three four
Sound off one two sound off three four
Sound off one two three four one two three four
