Let's take a train trip with Sven Olaf and see how he spends his day
My name is Sven Olaf, how do I start my day?
I ride a train to work and when I'm through I come the other way
My job I build the cuckoo clocks in a town in Switzerland
At night I play accordion in a polka band
The train went over the mountain
The train went over the mountain
The train went over the mountain to see what he could see
To see what he could see
To see what he could see
The train went over the mountain
The train went over the mountain
The train went over the mountain to see what he could see
And all that he could see, and all that he could see
The other side of the mountain, the other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see
I have a little shop far away from town
I take the train high up the hill, at night I come back down
Sometimes the snow falls on the tracks before I start my day
They have to call a big snow plow and blow it all away
The train is pushing the snowplow, the train is pushing the snowplow
The train is pushing the snowplow to blow the snow away
And all that it could blow, and all that it could blow
Is snow in front of the snowplow, the snow in front of the snowplow
The snow in front of the snowplow was all that it could blow
And all that it could blow
And all that it could blow
The snow in front of the snowplow
The snow in front of the snowplow
The snow in front of the snowplow
Was all that it could blow
The snow is off the track now
It won't be long before I ride the train to work and sing those choo choo songs
The train can move in the snow now
The train can move in the snow now
The train can move in the snow now
To go where it must go
To go where it must go
Go train
