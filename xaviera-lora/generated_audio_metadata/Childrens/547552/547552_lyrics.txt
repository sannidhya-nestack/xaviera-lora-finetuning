Five little fishies swimming in a pond
The first one said, "I'm tired," as he yawned
The second one said, "Well, let's take a nap"
The third one said, "Put on your sleeping cap"
The fourth one said, "Wake up, don't sleep"
The fifth one said, "Let's swim where it's deep"

The second one said, "Well, let's take a nap"
The third one said, "Put on your sleeping cap"
The fourth one said, "Wake up, don't sleep"
The fifth one said, "Let's swim where it's deep"
So the five little fishies swam away
