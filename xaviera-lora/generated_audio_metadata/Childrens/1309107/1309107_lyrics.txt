I've got a plan, I've got a dream
Build a rocket full steam
Grab some buttons, twist a dial
This spaceship's got super style
Counting down, it's almost time
Helmet on, I'm feeling fine
Flip the switch, engines roar
Three, two, one, let's explore
Blast off
Up we go, zooming through the stars, watch me glow
Floating high, way out of sight, dancing with the planets tonight
Zero gravity, spin around
Moonwalk on a starry ground
Wave to Martians, say hello
Shooting past a comet's glow
Counting down, it's almost time
Helmet on, I'm feeling fine
Flip the switch, engines roar
Three, two, one, let's explore
Blast off, off we go
Zooming through the stars, watch me glow
Floating high, way out of sight
Dancing with the planets tonight
Jupiter, Saturn way up there
Rings are spinning everywhere
Through the Milky Way we fly
Rocket racing through the sky
Blast off, up we go
Zooming through the stars watch me glow
Floating high way out of sight
Dancing with the planets tonight
Drifting down, back to bed, dreams of space still in my head
