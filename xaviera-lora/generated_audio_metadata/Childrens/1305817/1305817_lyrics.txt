We've got a stack of bright squares
Colorful arts each surface shares
Twist and folds with patient grace
Curving lines find their perfect place
Fold it up watch wonders glow
Paper tales we long to show
In each crease our feelings flow
Fold it up watch wonders glow
Paper cranes set free to soar
Bouncing frogs upon the floor
In each bend a secret sign
Shapes emerge that spark the mind
If corners catch or edges tear
We keep going, you don't despair
In every fold a story grows
A little world that each heart knows
Fold it up, watch wonders glow
Paper tales we long to show
In each crease our feelings flow
Fold it up watch wonders glow
Gather up these crafts so fine
Treasured forms that gently shine
Tucked away yet always near
Paper magic we hold dear
Gather up these crafts so fine
Treasured forms that gently shine
Tucked away yet always near
Paper magic we hold dear
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Solve it up, that's what I'm so fine
Treasure forms that gently shine
Tucked away and always near
Hate the magic we hold dear
For they love what wonders call
