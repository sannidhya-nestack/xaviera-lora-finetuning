I like to eat an apple every day
They're sweet and they're juicy I have to say
They're nice on their own or in a pie
Or eating them with cheese is something that you can try
There are more than eight thousand different varieties
It would take longer than twenty years to try each of these
You could eat one type every day until you tried them all
And by that time I think we'd find you'd grown rather tall
I like to eat an apple every day
They're sweet and they're juicy I have to say
They're nice on their own or in a tart
But sometimes you may find that they can make you fart
If you try some apple bobbing you can see
They float, this is great fun on your own or maybe with your pet goat
And the reason they don't sink is'cause they're one quarter air
Put them in a bowl of water, see them floating there
I like to eat an apple every day
Did you know apples are good for our brains?
They're nice when they're squished into apple juice too
And sometimes into cider for those older than you
