We gather'round the orchard in the glow of day
With baskets full of laughter that gently light the way
Sweet surprises shared while leaves shimmer high
Together we treasure bright wonders in the sky
Catch the sunshine, hold it in your hands
Feel it glowing bright across all the lands
Catch the sunshine, let it warm your heart
When we're all together, we can never drift apart
We chase gentle breezes through the swaying trees
Our smiles growing wider with every gentle breeze
Stories bloom around us like flowers in grass
Moments shine so brightly we pray they never pass
Hold the golden globe, keep it close at heart
In family's embrace, bright dreams always start
Ooh, catch the sunshine, hold it in your hands
Feel it glowing bright across all the lands
Catch the sunshine, let it warm your heart
When we're all together, we can never drift apart
Catch the sunshine, hold it close and true
With love all around us, there's always something new
