A merry band of pirates we
Outlawed by the aristocracy
Forever pirates we shall be
And I'm the captain, yes that's me
For I am Cam-Bly
Yes he is Cam-Bly
And he's only got one eye
Oh it's not my fault
My brother threw a feathered duster at me as a child
When I was a lad I do decree the wish I had to go to sea
When I grew up I became a deckhand
On a pirate ship of a pirate band
For I am Captain Blind (yes he is Captain Blind)
And I never ever cry (what never?)
No, never (what never?)
Bah, oddly ever (ha ha)
It's not my fault, I've got a blocked tear duct
I spent my time and I learnt my trade
Until at last I made the grade
A first class rogue among rogues a few
So I became the captain of the crew
For I am Captain Blind
Yes he is Captain Blind
And he's only got one eye
It's not my fault, I tripped and fell on a hippo
So now I've sailed the seven seas
My fame's renowned, everyone agrees
His fame's renowned, everyone agrees
And all my mates I'm proud to own
They never spit and they never moan
We never spit and we never moan
Captain Bligh! Captain Bligh!
Oh something terrible has happened!
Something terrible has -<|19.44|>
They've taken Rowena!
The Coast Guards, they've taken her!
Oh, tickle me giblet
But Captain, she'd be serious
Tell us what happened!
Irina who was captured thus
She made no cry and she made no fuss
By her Coast Guard gang, I swear just here
They questioned her about her career
Oh horror!
For Rowena was a pirate true
What on earth are we going to do?
On a cliff top path the hideout stands
Five hundred feet above golden sands
We must strike fast before she speaks
They mustn't find out else us they'll seek
So we shall have to rescue her
be a deed of brave and terrible dare
An operation for one so sly, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
It's just the job for Captain Bly
For I am Captain Bly (Yes, he is Captain Bly)
In the pirate flag I fly (Captain Bly, Captain Bly, Captain Bly)
Shiver me timbers and call me Shirley
Come on Roger
