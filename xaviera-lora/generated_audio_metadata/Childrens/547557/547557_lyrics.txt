Five little seashells sleeping on the shore
Swish went a big wave and then there were four
Four little seashells, quiet as can be
Swish went a big wave and then there were three
Three little seashells, early and new
Swish went a big wave and then there were two
Two little seashells lying in the sun
Swish went a big wave and then there was one
One little seashell left all alone
Swish went a big way and then there were none
Five little seashells gone out to sea
Wait until the morning they'll return to me
Wait until the morning they'll return to me
