Close your eyes and think about mommy
Holding you so close to her heart
She loves you, oh sweet little angel
Though you knew that right from the start
Close your eyes and think about daddy
Tickling your toes and making you laugh
Playing for hours, you're getting sleepy
Stretch and yawn on your daddy's lap
Time to sleep my baby
Close your eyes, lay down your head
Think about the morning light
As I tuck you into the night
Close your eyes and think about stardust falling down from stars in the sky
Hush now baby, mommy is near you, daddy sings a sweet lullaby
Time to sleep my baby
Close your eyes lay down your head
Think about the morning light
As I took you in tonight
Close your eyes and think about moonbeams
Shooting past your window so fast
Your eyes are heavy, it's not much longer
Close your eyes and sleep at last
Close your eyes and sleep at last
