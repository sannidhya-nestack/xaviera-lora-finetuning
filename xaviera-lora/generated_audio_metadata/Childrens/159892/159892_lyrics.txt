If I were a princess I'd have lots of shiny rings
If I were an angel I'd have several pairs of wings
If I were a sailor I would wear a cute white hat
If I were a witch I'd have a terrible black cat
If I were just a child just about your size
I'd dream of all that I could be
Then I'd wake up happily to find that I'm someone like me
When I open up my eyes
If I were a church bell, I would ring each day at noon
If I were a violin, I'd always be in tune
If I were an elephant, I'd have a handy nose
If I were Romeo, I'd send my lover Rose
If I were just a child, just about your size
I'd dream of all that I could be
Then I'd wake up happily to find that I'm someone like me
When I open up my eyes
La la la la la la la la
If I were a star up in the sky I'd shine so bright
All the angels up there just would not sleep at night
If I were the jungle, I'd be full of snakes and birds
If I were a storybook, I'd have a million words
If I were just a child, just about your size
I'd dream of all that I could be
Then I'd wake up happily to find that I'm someone like me
When I open up my eyes
I would dream of all that I could be and then I'd wake up
Happily to find that I'm someone like me
When I open up my eyes
