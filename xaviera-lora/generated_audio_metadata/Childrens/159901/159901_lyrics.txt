Here comes Katie cute there's a calamity
How much trouble can a little girl make
She's just a three foot visitor
So why is it I feel the house tremble and shiver and shake
Cause she's a girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
She's gonna shake, shake
She's gonna shake, shake, shake
Girl quake, girl quake
Now she's in the garden, there go the roses
Now she's in the parlor, there go the chairs
Now she's in the kitchen, it's a crash-a-rama
Watch her do the locomotion, watch her do the who cares
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
She's gotta shake, shake
She's gotta shake, shake, shake
Girl quake, girl quake
Bees in trouble and a small pair of shoes
She's gotta shake you down
Yeah look out, she's a chaster yeah
She's a chaster if the dishes had wishes
They would get out of town
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
Girl quake, girl quake
She's gonna shake, shake
She's gonna shake, shake
She's a girl quake, girl quake
Girl quick, girl quick
Girl quick, girl quick, quick, quick

Better warn the mailman and the lady next door
Half your size but twice your magnitude
A cute calamity of seismic size for
