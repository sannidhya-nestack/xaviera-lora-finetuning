Don't be shy, pick up your pen
Then we can write too
Our best friend
And say how are you?
How do you do?
We can write too
Our best friend
And say this is me
Is that you?
On your mask it said
We can learn the alphabet
On your marks, get set
We can learn the alphabet

If you go wrong
Just start again
We can write two
Our best friends
And say how are you?
How do you do?
Yes we can write to
Our best friends
And say this is me

On your mask it said
We can learn the alphabet
On your marks, get set
