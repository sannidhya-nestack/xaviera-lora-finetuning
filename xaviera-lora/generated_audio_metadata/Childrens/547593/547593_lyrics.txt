Smile my little baby with your eyes so bright
You're my precious bundle
Loving you is so right
Close your eyes my baby
While I hold you near
Kissing you so softly
I'm so glad that you're here
Watching you in my arms
At night holding tight to your little hand
Kiss your cheeks that are soft
And sweet go to sleep
I know that you can
Sleep my little baby
Sleep till morning comes
Slumber in your cradle
Dream sweet dreams until dawn
Close your eyes, my angel
Rest among the clouds
Looking calm and peaceful
You make mommy so proud
Watching you in my arms
At night holding tight to your little hand
Kiss your cheeks that are soft and sweet
Go to sleep, I know that you can
Kiss your cheeks that are soft and sweet
Go to sleep, I know that you can
