It's winter in Plymouth
Gale winds are blowing
The ocean is cold and the sun's far away
A speck in the distance on the horizon
Has captured my interest all day today
Ooh
I've watched it for hours
It seems to be moving closer and closer
Growing in size
Too big for a driftwood
Too small for a rain cloud
The spot on the water
Amazes my eyes
Is it an angel
Come down from heaven
Or is it the play friend
I've waited for
Is it the figment of my imagination?
I've never seen anything like it before
Us back in the distance
Us back in the distance
Us back in the distance
Us back in the distance
