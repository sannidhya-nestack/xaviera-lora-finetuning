Mr. Seagull, don't you wanna rock with me? Go
Don't you wanna, Mr. Seagull, don't you wanna rock with me?
Mr. Seagull, when we gonna get together?
I don't wanna wait forever
Don't you wanna rock with me?
You're so legal, oh so fancy free
Not at all like me
Stuck here on the ground
Love you so, why you gotta be so cold?
Can't you say hello when you come to town?
Stick around Mr. Seagull
Don't you wanna rock with me, go
Don't you wanna Mr. Seagull
Don't you wanna rock with me
Mr. Seagull, when are we gonna get together?
I don't wanna wait forever
Don't you wanna rock with me?
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Say you wanna, say you wanna
Don't you wanna rock with me?
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Say you wanna, say you wanna
Don't you wanna rock with me?
You're so illegal, oh so fancy free
Not at all like me, stuck here on the ground
Love you so, why you gotta be so cold?
Can't you say hello when you come to town?
Stick around Mr. Seagull
Don't you wanna rock with me, go
Don't you wanna Mr. Seagull
Don't you wanna rock with me
Mr. Seagull, when we gonna get together?
I don't wanna wait forever
Don't you wanna rock with me?
Mr. Seagull, Mr. Seagull
Mr. Seagull, don't you wanna rock with me?
