Tramping around with my giant feet
T-rex roars can't be beat
Chomping greens in dino land
Big and strong I take my stand
Stomp stomp stomp let's do the dino dance
Wiggle your tail at every chance
Stomp, stomp, stomp all day long
Hear the beat and join our song
Roar, roar, dino roar
Shake the ground we want some more
Mighty calls from head to tail
Dino pals we never fail
Tiptoe slow then leap up high
Feel that echo soar the sky
Laugh so loud in the dino way
Joyful steps brightening our day
Roar roar dino roar
Shake the ground we want some more
Mighty calls from head to tail
Dino pals we never fail
Dino's here, dinosaurs there
Rumbling fun we love to share
With a stomp and a friendly cheer
Dino groove stays far and near
