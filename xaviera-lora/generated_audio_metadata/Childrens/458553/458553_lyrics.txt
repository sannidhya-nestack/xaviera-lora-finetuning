Tiny, frightened child
Feeling yourself breathing
Your first breath
Though your heart flutters like a bird's
Take comfort in these words
You are of my body, by my side
In my heart forever
So close your eyes and sleep in the peace of my love
Your eyes are my eyes
My smile is your smile
I see what is good in me in you
I'll be here to help you grow
But for now just know
You are of my body, by my side
In my heart forever, so close your eyes
And sleep in the peace of my love
In a world not yet divided by pedigree or race
You are still an angel in a state of perfect grace
You are of my body, by my side, in my heart forever
So close your eyes and sleep in the peace of my life
