Wake up sunshine, what do you hear?
It's a new day, laughter is near
Can you feel the rhythm in your feet?
Let's find a beat on our busy street
Step outside, listen close
Everything's moving, here we go
What's that sound? Can you name it?
Clouds don't jump (jump) let's play it
What's that sound? Can you find it?
Sing it loud, everyone's invited
Bells are ringing, buses go by
Birds start singing, friends say hi
Wheels are spinning, dogs bark out
Let's make a band, shout and shout
People talking, cars haul too
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
All together, me and you
What's that sound? (Chop)
Can you name it?
Clap, stomp, jump
Let's play it
What's that sound? (Chop)
Can you find it?
Sing it loud
Everyone's invited
Right now, right here, every sound is clear
Let's pretend and make music appear
What's that sound? Can you name it?
Clap, stomp, jump (jump) let's play it
What's that sound? Can you find it?
Sing it loud, everyone's invited
Clap along, make a sound
We're a happy sing along crowd
