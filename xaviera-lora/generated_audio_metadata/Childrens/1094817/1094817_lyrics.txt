Pencils, erasers, a few worried faces
A people to meet, things to remember
It's alright really, it's only September
No more late to bed after slow lazy days
Sand castles vanish with summertime haze
Soon there'll be snowflakes and bright glowing embers
Warming your toes at the end of December
So do your work well, be kind and be strong
The summer will always return before long
Then when the ice disappears from the lake
All things will at once it seems slowly awake
And soon there'll be many more long lazy days
The sandcastles waiting in sweet scented haze
Just do your work well, be kind and be strong
And summer will always return before long
With pencils, erasers, a few worried faces
The people to meet and things to remember
It's alright really, it's only September
No more late to bed after slow lazy days
Where sand castles vanish with summertime haze
Where soon there'll be snowflakes and bright glowing embers
Of warming your toes at the end of December
So do your work well, be kind and be strong
And summer will always return before long
