With a real imagination
No telling what you might be
With a real imagination
Well that's all you really need
Or no telling what you might be
If you're a boy or you're a girl
You have a place inside this world
If you hold within your heart a dream
Fly a rocket through the stars
Just be who you are
And you're sure to find the circus of your dreams
With a real imagination
No telling what you might be
With a real imagination
That's all you really need
No telling what you might be
No telling what you might be
