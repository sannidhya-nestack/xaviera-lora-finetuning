As I sit here looking out
At this wondrous beauty throughout
Seagulls singing to me
Yellow butterflies flying so free
It feels like only a dream away
It feels like only a dream away
A dream away
Green grass blowing in the wind
Blue waves crashing downwind
Puffs of white color the sky
Rays of light painting oranges and white
It feels like only a dream away
It feels like only a dream away
