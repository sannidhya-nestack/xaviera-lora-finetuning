I went to Kentucky, the old Kentucky Fair
I met a señorita with flowers in her hair
Oh shake'em, shake'em, shake'em, shake'im if you can
Oh shake'em, shake'em, shake'em, shake'im if you can
Round and round and round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
I went to Kentucky, the old Kentucky Fair
I met a señorita with flowers in her hair
Shake'em, shake'em, shake'em, shake'em if you can
Shake'em, shake'em, shake'im, oh shake'im if you can
Round and round and round she goes where she stops nobody knows
