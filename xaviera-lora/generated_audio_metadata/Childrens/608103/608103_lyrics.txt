There are times when we need to say
That something is great
Or there are so many somethings
These times it's okay
To slightly exaggerate
But let's get some numbers straight
Okay, there are thousands and millions
Billions and trillions
But there are no kazillions
There are thousands and millions
Billions and trillions, but there are no gajillions
So count all the passing cars, count all the tiny stars
Measure in feet how many
Your house is from Africa, your Husky's from Canada, count all the falling snowflakes
There are thousands and millions, billions and trillions, but there are no gazillions
There are thousands and millions, billions and trillions, but there are no
Vigillions
One more thing
There's no such thing
Infinity's not a number
Infinity's just a word that means
Goes on forever and ever
Ever and ever
So sing and don't hesitate
Think'til your brain vibrates
Count to a subtillion and sixty
There are fifty state capitals
For insects and animals
So many it can make you dizzy
There are thousands and millions
Billions and trillions
But there are no kazillions
There are thousands and millions
Billions and trillions
But there are no gajillions
Thousands and millions, billions, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tridecillion, quaterdecillion, quindecillion, sextecillion, sedecillion
Septendecillion, octodecillion, novemdecillion, vigintillion, centillion
