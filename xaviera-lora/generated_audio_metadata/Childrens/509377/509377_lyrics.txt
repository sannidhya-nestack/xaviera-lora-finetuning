Hush little baby, don't say a word
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird
If that mockingbird won't sing
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring turns brass
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass
If that looking glass gets broke
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat
If that billy goat won't pull
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull
If that cart and bull turn over
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover
If that dog named Rover won't bark
Papa's gonna buy you a horse and cart
If that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town
