Calling all children home to bed
Ole ole in free sleepy head
Don't et what the wise man said
He said hey, nani hey nani hosi hey
Calling all children home for the night
Catch a star and hold on tight
Oh, you are a beautiful sight singing hey
Nani hey nani ho sing hey
Leave your dolls in their little breast beds
Leave your books in your pockets and sleds
Leave your puppies in bikes and bubbles
Leave your cares and leave your troubles
Calling all children in for the day
Dishes and spoons and toys away
Owl and fox coming out to play singing hey
Daane hainaane ho sii
Leave your dolls in their little brass beds
Leave your books and your buckets and sleds
Leave your puppies in bikes and bubbles
Leave your cares and leave your troubles
I'm calling all children
Comes the moon
Dishes running with the spool
Whatever you do don't grow up too soon
Just say hey
Hey nani ho sing hey (sing hey)
Nani ho sing hey (sing hey)
Hey nani ho sing hey
Hey nani ho sing hey
Hey nani ho sing hey (sing hey, hey)
Hey nani ho sing hey
Hey nani ho sing hey
