It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
There's a bluebird on my shoulder
There's a baby on my knee
There's a treasure in my pocket
There's an angel in my tree
Let's pick a thousand flowers
Better yet, let's watch'em grow
One thing I'll tell you is the one thing I know
It's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
Oh, no, it's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
There's a baby on my shoulders
Do you hear the song she sings?
Now both of my ears have music
Now both of my shoes have wings
Let's catch a thousand fireflies
Better yet, let's watch'em blow
One thing I'll tell you is the one thing I know
It's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
La la, la la, la la, la la, la la
There's a bluebird on your shoulder
Listening to every word your mama's singing to her
Baby, baby, singing to the bird
Give me a thousand kisses
Better yet, let me kiss you
Someday I'll sing to you the first song you knew
It's a wonderful life, oh yeah, it's a wonderful life, oh no, it's a wonderful life, it's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
Oh no, it's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful, wonderful, it's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, it's a wonderful, wonderful wonderful
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, it's so wonderful, wonderful life
Oh yeah, it's a wonderful life
Oh no, it's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
Oh yes, a wonderful life
Oh yes, a wonderful life
Oh no, it's a wonderful
