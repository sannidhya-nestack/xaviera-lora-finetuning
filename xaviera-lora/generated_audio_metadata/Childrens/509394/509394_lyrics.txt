In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o
Alive, alive-o-ho, alive, alive-o-ho
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o-ho
Alive, alive, oh-oh
Alive, alive, oh-oh
Brain cockles and muscles
Alive, alive, oh-oh
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive-o-ho, alive, alive-o-ho
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o-ho
Alive, alive-o-ho, alive, alive-o-ho
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o-ho
Alive, alive-o-ho, alive, alive-o-ho
Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o-ho
