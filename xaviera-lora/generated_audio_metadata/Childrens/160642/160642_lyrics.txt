Hey listen baby, can you hear it baby
Hear the whistle, it's calling, let's walk down to the train
Hey listen baby, can you hear it baby
Hear the whistle, it's calling, let's walk down to the train
You know who's riding, riding on that train
Someone who loves you like I do
Let's walk down to the train
Your daddy's riding, good and tall
And big enough to hold you like I do
Let's walk down to the train

Hey listen baby
Can you hear it, baby? Hear the whistle? It's calling! Let's walk down to the train!

It's coming, let's walk down to the train
Now can you see him shouting, waving, love is big and noisy
He's coming, let's walk down to the train
Hey listen baby, can you hear it baby
Hear the whistle, it's calling

There's someone running, running, jumping from the train
He sees you, he loves you, let's walk down to the train
Go jump your daddy, run and catch him, run and jump your daddy
He loves you, run jump down to the train
