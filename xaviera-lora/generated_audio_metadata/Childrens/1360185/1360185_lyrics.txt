Sunshine on my toes, skip skip as I go
Right outside my door, feel that happy glow
Tiny breeze, tickle knees
Can you hear those singing trees?
Let's run to the park hooray
Slide and swing the clouds away
Spinning round we dance and play
Every step is just our way
Sunshine laughter magic days
Jungle gym so tall
Jump, I nearly fall
Green grass underneath
Bugs begin to call
Sherping birds, happy words
Giggles are the best I've heard
Let's run to the park, hooray
Slide and swing the clouds away
Spinning round we dance and play
Every step is just our way
Sunshine laughter magic days
We
Hop stop pop drop
My shoes go fast, my heart goes faster
With every laugh, we chase disaster (it's so fun)
Let's run to the park, hooray
Slide and swing the clouds away
Spinning round we dance and play
Every step is just our way
Sunshine, laughter, magic day
Wave bye to the park
Till tomorrow we'll embark
