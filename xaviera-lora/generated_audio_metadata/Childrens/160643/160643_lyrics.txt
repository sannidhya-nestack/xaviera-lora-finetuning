I saw some wings at the angel's store and I asked my mom to buy'em, she did
And when the wind was right last night I thought I'd try'em
And they caught the wind, those wings of mine, and I jumped into the sky
And a witch flew by and winked at me and a rocket ship said "Hi"
And I flew past the playground where the big kids like to fight
And the ice cream truck was fast asleep and the swings were tucked in tight
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And I flew over Ruby's house and her dolls were still awake
I could hear them singing tiny songs and playing petty cake
And I flew past the city zoo and I heard a lion roar
Like he had had a scary dream or his tail was caught in the door
And I flew over Miller's farm where there's seven thousand sheep
But I did not stop to count them'cause I thought I might fall asleep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Then I flew home and Jake the dog he did not even bark
He thought I was Peter Pan out chasing pirates in the dark
Back in my bed I close my eyes and somewhere someone sings
A song about someone like me who has a pair of wings
Oh I'm so glad I'm somebody who has a pair of wings
You can just call me somebody who has a pair of wings
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh I'm so glad I'm somebody who has a pair of wings
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
