Row the boat
Up the river now, row the boat
Up the river now, row the boat
Up the river it's a lovely way to pass the day
So row the boat
All together now, row the boat
All together now, row the boat
All together there's a hole in the boat
Can we stay up low? Don't rock the boat
Up the river, don't rock the boat
Up the river, don't rock the boat
Up the river,'cause the water is cold
And it makes me shiver, rock the boat
Up the river, don't rock the boat
Up the river, don't rock the boat
Up the river'cause the water is deep
And we're strong, Ali
Row the boat
Up the river now, row the boat
Up the river now, row the boat
Up the river, well, what do you think?
Are we going to sink?
There's a hole in the boat
Can we stay afloat?
The water is deep
And we're strong, Ali
Row the boat
