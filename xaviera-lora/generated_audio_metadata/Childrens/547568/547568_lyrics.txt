I'd like to dedicate this song to my friend the Tiger Tamer
I love the Tiger Tamer
We do the show together every night
I love the Tiger Tamer
I know'cause I'm a tiger and he treats me right
He rolls me out in my cage
Each and every day
Can't wait to be near the man scratching my ear
Soon we'll start to play
I love the Tiger Tamer
We do the show together every night
I love the Tiger Tamer
I know'cause I'm a tiger and the truth in me right
He loves the tiger so
He loves the lions too
Hang on my man with my dinner in his hand
The show is starting soon
I love the Tiger Tamer
We do the show together every midnight
I love the Tiger Tamer
I know'cause I'm a tiger and it's treating me right
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
(Tiger Tamer, Tiger Tamer, Tiger Tamer, Tiger Tamer)
When showtime begins
We're waiting, anticipating
Spotlight shines so bright
All us cats participating
Line up to walk this way
In a circular fashion
Make room to roll that way
Each of us to the last one! (I can feel it)
I love the Tiger Tamer
We do the show together every night
I love the Tiger Tamer
I know'cause I'm a tiger and it treats me right
I love the Tiger Tamer
We do the show together every night
I love the Tiger Tamer
I know'cause I'm a tiger and it treats me right
Lions and tigers
Oh, the Tiger Tamer too
(Timer, timer, timer, timer, timer, timer, timer)
This song is for the big bopper under the big top
The Tiger Jamer
He stops in my book
Singing in the three ring circus, big bopper
You already won this shoot, you already won this shoot, you already won this shoot
