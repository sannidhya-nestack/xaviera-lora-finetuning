Yankee Doodle came to town riding on a pony
He stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni
Yankee Doodle keep it up Yankee Doodle dandy
Mind the music and the steps and with the girls be handy
Yankee Doodle came to town, riding on a pony
He stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni
The Yankee Doodle came to town riding on a pony
He stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni
Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle Dandy
Mind the music and the steps and with the girls be handy
A Yankee Doodle Dandy
