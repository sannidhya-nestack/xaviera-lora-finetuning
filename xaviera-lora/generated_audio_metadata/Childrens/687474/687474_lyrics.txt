You know you're such a lovely frog
The way you jump around your bog
You should always wear a crown
Because you're queen when you're around
And I say yeah
If only I could rule the roost
With legs like that, oh what a boost
I would jump around the world without a care
You are my friend
Amphibian, you're my friend
I love the way you stare, two bulging eyes
You've got no hair, your skin is green and like a raincoat
Slick and cool, a song in your throat, I say yeah
If only I could sing all day, I'd croak across the Milky Way
And all the world would drip like water off my back
You are my friend, amphibian, you're my friend
I love you frog, I love you frog, you lovely frog
It's funny yesterday I thought that maybe you're away
The pond was quiet and abandoned
Did we humans have a hand in nature's mess?
But I know just what you'd say when there's a price you've got to pay
You've gotta love the frogs who live in your backyard
I love you frogs
You love the frogs
I love all frogs
Amphibians
You are our friends
Amphibians
I love you frogs, you lovely frogs
I love all frogs
I love you frogs, you lovely frogs
We love all frogs
Baby, baby, baby, baby
