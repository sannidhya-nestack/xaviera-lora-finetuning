Celery, celery
It tastes so fresh and so crunchy
There's lots of people who agree
That we love celery
Celery, celery
It's good for you and good for me
I like to eat it frequently
That veg called celery
We've been growing it for three thousand years
But it didn't used to be our food
It was used as medicine instead
Partly'cause it helped to calm our moods
But now we like to eat the stalks
It's lovely cooked or raw
In salads, soups and smoothies
It is nice to add for sure
Celery, celery
Grows to two feet or to three
Out in the garden you may see
That fetch called celery
Celery, celery
I love to munch its stems of green
And you will know just what I mean
When you eat celery
Back in the times of ancient Greece it had another use
It was given like a bunch of flowers for the winners of their games, it's true
It seems a funny prize to give to athletes when they win
I think I'd rather eat it up as part of my din din
Celery, celery, it tastes so fresh and so crunchy
There's lots of people who agree that we love celery
Celery, celery, it's good for you and good for me
I like to eat it frequently, that veg called celery
Celery, celery, that veg called celery
