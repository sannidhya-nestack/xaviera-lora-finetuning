When you're feeling lonely you might just call on friends
They could be thinking of you and hoping you drop in
A good belt snug and easy they fit like an old shoe
When you start a sentence they finish it for you
It's a perfect friendship, I think that you'll agree
They're both into each other, they're both good company
They're good company, they're good company
They're good company, they're good company
You can share your problems
And they can count on you
You both pitch in with problems
You're loyal and true blue
Ooh, you're a constant duo
Stuck to each other tight
If someone comes between ya
They're gonna get a fight
It's a perfect friendship
I think that you'll agree
They both give to each other
They're both good company
They're good company
They're good company
They're good company
They're good company
It's a pleasant place to be
When you've got good company
They're so close together
They seem like they're combined
If you spot the one chum, the other's close behind
It's a perfect friendship, I think that you'll agree
They're both good to each other, they're both good company
See, I said it
They're good company, they're good company
They're good company, they're good company, ooh yeah yeah
They're good company, they're good company
They're good company, they're good company, ooh yeah yeah
They're good company, they're good
