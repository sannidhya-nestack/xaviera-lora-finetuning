Pulls the plane so high
Carrying us to the unknown sky
Through the clouds dreams take flight
Destinations, blackened day turns to night
Edelblings, dreams ignite
Reaching heights, pains in the night
Together we soar, side by side
Guided by stars, our spirits collide
Edelblings,'cross the sky we roam
Chasing dreams, finding our home
Bound by fate, our hearts call
In the skies we freely roam
Hold our hands, we freely roam
Through the heavens we gracefully glide
Adventure calls, nowhere to hide
Each journey's hell yet to unfold
In these plains our story is told
Edelweiss dreams ignite our
Hero face'cross the sky we roam
Chasing dreams finding our home
Bound by fate our hearts fold
In the skies we freely roam
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our heads we freely roll
Black bridge, how did it not be hanging?
꿈을 안고 우린 함께 세상 우리 것인데
하늘 높고 우린 넓어 all our hands we freely roll
Black bridge 하늘나라 비행기
꿈을 안고 우린 함께 세상 우리 것인데
