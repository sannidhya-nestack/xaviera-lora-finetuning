In the heart of slow city lights shimmer bright
Your smile catches me under the moonlight
The sound of love echoing throughout the night
In our secret language, it feels so right
We're dancing together, but I don't need your kiss
Trapped in the melody, lost in the place
Each beat of my heart, singing your praise
In this twirling rhythm, your love amazes
Oh, in the crowded streets
You'll laugh a sweet sound
Like a harmonious tune all around
Each look, each whisper in them I found
This K-Pop love
Unbound, unbound
In sync with the rhythm, bodies in the rhythm
