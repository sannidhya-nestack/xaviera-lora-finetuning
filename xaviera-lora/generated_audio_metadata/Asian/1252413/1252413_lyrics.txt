Above the clouds where dreams come true
I'm lost in a love that's just me and you
Beyond the horizon we'll find our way
Into the unknown we'll fly, we'll sway
Your voice is my favorite melody
Soon in my soul, setting me free
With every step we create a symphony
A dance of love, just you and me
In the storms we'll find our peace
Our love will never cease
Graces of a future shining bright
Together we rise, reaching new heights
Hand in hand we'll conquer it all
Stand strong and never fall
Whispered promises in the night
We'll hold on tight, till the morning light
Our love story written in the stars
No matter the distance, no matter how far
Together we'll defeat any odds
In each other's arms, finding our gods
Your voice is my favorite melody
Soothing my soul, setting me free
With every step we create a symphony
A dance of love, just you and me
Through the storms we'll find our peace
Our love will never cease
Glimpses of a future shining bright
Together we rise
Reaching new heights
Hand in hand we'll conquer it all
Stand strong and never fall
Whispered promises in the night
We'll hold on tight
the morning light, oh
Hand in hand, we'll conquer it all
Stand strong and never fall
Whisper promises in the night
We'll hold on tight until the morning light
Our love will never cease
Glimpses of a future shining bright
Together we rise, reaching new heights
Hand in hand, we'll conquer it all
