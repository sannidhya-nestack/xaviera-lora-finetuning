In the middle of a thunderstorm
In the swirling light
I found a glimpse of you, a piece of the night
Your eyes like shimmering stars
My heart takes flight
Can't hide this feeling
Even if I might
Crazily dancing to our beat
Under the neon glow
Our hearts in harmony
Putting on a show
With each lyric
With each note
I wanna let you know
With you I found my tempo
In the labyrinth of the crowd, your laughter rings
Like a melody composed just for kings
Every glance, every touch feels like it's spring
The chorus of the night to you I sing
In the symphony of love, we're both in the flow
Like a melody composed just for key
Every glimpse, every touch feels like it's spring
The chorus of the night to you I sing
In the symphony of love we're both in the flow
The rhythm in our veins letting ourselves go
With every beat every stroke under this cold snow
With you our song starts to grow
Will you dance with me in the whisper breeze
A melody of love captured in the breeze
In this moment, just you and me
Time seems to cease with you, I found that the end of the season
The rhythm of the night under the stars glow
Our hearts in sync, the beating, it's slow
With this song, with this dance, I hope you know, K-pop of love
