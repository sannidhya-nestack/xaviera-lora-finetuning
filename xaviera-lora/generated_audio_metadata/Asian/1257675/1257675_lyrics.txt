Moonlight glowing hard to show it
In the rhythm of soul
Love is growing on the city streets
Where we find our beat
In the dance of life where dreams meet
K-pop in our souls
Music in our veins
Lost in the melody where love reigns
This is our story, in every glory
Underneath the stars, it's our territory
Silhouettes against the dawn
Two hearts beating, singing our song
Light shimmering, night whispering
In this K-Pop tale, we're shimmering, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Silhouettes against the dawn
Two hearts beating singing our song
Night shimmering
Night whispering
In this K-pop tale we're shimmering
K-pop in our blood
Rhythm in our heart
In this city of dreams we play our part
Echoes of our song
Across the sky
In this K-pop world we ain't behind
So here we are under neon sights
Living our K-pop nights
In every rhythm and every rhyme
In this K-pop song we lose track of time
