Caught in a dirty life, heart rate at one
Playing with fire, feeling just like a child
Walking through neon lights, under the moonlight
Lost in the rhythm, caught up in this life
We're dancing on a thin line, can't define what's wrong or right
Running with the time, the city is all night
In the heart of soul, we let it go
With the rhythm, with the flow
Untamed hearts, we're running wild
In the city of neon lights
Words spoken silently
Through whispers and glances
Underneath the neon lights
We're taking our chances
Reflections on rain slick streets
Painted with desire
Gone by the rhythm, drawn to the fire
In the heart of soul, we let it go
With the rhythm, with the flow
Unseen hearts, we're running wild
In the city of neon lights
We've spoken silently
Through whispers and glances
Underneath the neon lights
We're taking our chances
Reflections on rain slick streets
Painted with desire
Bound by the rhythm, drawn to the fire
In the heart of soul, we let it go
Caught in the rhythm, caught in the flow
Untamed hearts, we're running wild
In the city, the city of your lies
Oh, oh
So when the dark comes, we find our hearts so beating to the rhythm of the night
In so the city of neon lights
