Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm
Late night hop into taxi ride
Taxi uncle smile eyes so bright
Ask me where you going tonight
I say just home love feeling light
Taxi uncle tell me stories old and new
About the city lights and morning dew
We laugh and chat till journeys end
In this ride we make a friend
He share about his younger days
How things change in many ways
From kampong life to buildings high
Under the same big Singapore skies
Taxi uncle tell me stories old and new
About the love and life he once knew
We bridge the gap, our hearts extend
In this drive we make a friend
Traffic's slow but time flies fast
Moments like this hope they last
He says take care I wave goodbye
Carry his wisdom as time goes by
Taxi uncle tell me stories old and new
About the dreams he chased and drew
We share a bond that doesn't end
In this ride we make a friend
In the city moving day and night
Strangers meet under fading light
Simple chats, connections grow
In these moments life we know
Taxi uncle tell me stories old and new
About the journey and the view
We laugh and chat'til journey's end
In this ride we make a friend
End, end
