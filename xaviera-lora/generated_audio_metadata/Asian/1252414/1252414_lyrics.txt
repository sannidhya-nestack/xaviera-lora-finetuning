Walking down continue on screen
Lights reflecting in your eyes
Your laughter echoes in my mind
Rainbow will crystallize
Don't you see the stars align
Dancing to the rhythm of time
Hand in hand we'll write our rhyme
Forever you'll be mine
Under the moonlight sky
We'll fly, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Walking down Gumi on streetlights reflecting in our eyes
Your laughter echoes in my mind, every moment crystallized
Don't you see the stars align, dancing to the rhythm of time
Hand in hand, we'll ride or rhyme, forever you'll be mine
Under the moonlit sky, we'll fly
Fly, we'll fly, we'll fly
Fly, we'll fly, we'll fly
I will fly, ooh, ooh, fly, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll fly, I'll fly, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
High in the open sky
I'll fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, mm-mm
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
