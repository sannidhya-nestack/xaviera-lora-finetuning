Pray the city lights, chasing the sun
Until the stars come up, our adventure's begun
Got my heartbeat racing, can't contain this feeling
With you by my side
It's the world we're stealing
Let's paint the town in our color
Life is a canvas let's be its author
Sing it loud, dance like no other
Just you and I
Lost in each other
City's heartbeat echoed in sync with mine
Underneath the neon lights your eyes they shine
Footsteps on the pavement, whispers in the wind
With each shed secret our stories pinned
Stars as our spotlight, the world our stage
Encapsulating moments, we don't need a page
Hand in hand, let's take this leap in this life
