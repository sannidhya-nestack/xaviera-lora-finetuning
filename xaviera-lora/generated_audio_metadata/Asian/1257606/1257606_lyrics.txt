In the city lights, chasing the neon dreams
Wandering all night, lost in the starry streams
Feeling the music pulse, the beat within our heart
We're dancing in the rhythm, never want to depart
We're painting the town, cars astray
In the rhythm of love we sway
United under moonlight's glow
In the serenade of the night we flow
Whispered promises, beneath the diamond sky
In the echo of the night our dreams never die
Laughter mingles with the melodious K-Pop tune
In the canvas of the night we draw our own moon
We're painting the town, colors astray
In the rhythm of love we sway
United under moonlight's glow
In the serenade of the night we flow
As though the city's gate, stories untold
In the harmony of night we hold
With K-Pop beats we rise and fall in this melody
We find our call
We're painting the town, colors are straight
In the rhythm of love we sway
United under moonlight's glow
In the serenade of the night we float
As the night fades we find our song
In this kaleidoscope of life we belong
The K-pop rhythm that goes etching our town
In the dance of the night we revel
