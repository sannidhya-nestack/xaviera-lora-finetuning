Whoa, we're running wild tonight
Lights flash, heart speed in time
No regrets, no slowing down
Feel the fever all around
Electric dreams are calling
Feel the rush, no falling
We own the night, we chase the scars
No looking back, we've come too far
Let it burn, feel the fire inside
We're unstoppable, watch us collide
Take my hand, let's break the night
We shine forever, shining bright
Neon fever, turn it up, up, up
Dancing'til the sun comes up
Feel the rhythm, feel the vibe
We own the night, we come alive
Whoa-oh-oh, light it up now
Oh-oh-oh, never slow down
Feel the fever, we're shining bright forever
Step to the beat, no time to wait
We elevate, we radiate
Flashing lights, hearts on fire
One more move, let's take it higher
Let it burn, feel the fire inside
We're unstoppable, watch us collide
Take my hand, let's break the night
We shine forever, shining bright
Neo on fever, turn it up up up
Dancing'til the sun comes up
Feel the rhythm, feel the vibe
We own the night, we come alive
Woah-oh-oh, light it up now
Woah-oh-oh, never slow down
Woah-oh-oh, feel the fever
We're shining bright forever
Step to the beat, no time to wait
We elevate, we radiate
Flashing lights, hearts on fire
One more move, let's take it higher
In the dark, we find our way
Through the night, we'll never fade
Every heartbeat, every light
We glow together, burning bright
Neon fever turn it up, up, up
Dancing'til the sun comes up
Feel the rhythm, feel the vibe
We own the night, we come alive
Woah, light it up now
Woah, never slowing down
Woah, feel the fever
We're shining bright forever
