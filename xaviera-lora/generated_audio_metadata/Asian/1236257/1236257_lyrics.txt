In the ebb and flow of love's embrace, we dance to the rhythm of our heart's race
Like a wind in the deep blue sea, your love pulls me closer, setting me free
As ice in the wind, our love's so true
Tide of passion pulling me to you
In your eyes I find my place
Lost in currents of love and praise
Currents of love, love and praise
Currents so true
Tide of passion pulling me to you
In your eyes I find my place
Lost in currents of love and praise
Currents of love's falling on
A love embraced by the ground
In your arms I am found
Together we'll ride never to fall down
My love, heart to heart
Just pull me once and come see
You're the anchor that sets me at ease
In the currents of our destiny
We're bound together forever and freely
To wrestle truth, a tide of passion
Pulling me to you, in your eyes, I find my place
Lost in cares, our love's embrace
Currents of love swirling by, our love's embrace
Burning around, in your arms I am found
Together we will find never to part
Bound by love, heart to heart, oh
Oh, that bridge
사랑의 파도 뿌리 함께
마음을 잡아 풀어 헤쳐
한없이 넓은 바다 같아
