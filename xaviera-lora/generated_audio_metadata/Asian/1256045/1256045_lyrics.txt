In the heart I'm still under the neon dreams
Clogged in the rhythm
Lost in the beats
I snatch mine in the crowd it seems
This can't go by
Beat of the streets
People post
It's a melody sweet
An enchanting rhythm makes our hearts meet
Underneath the stars in the city heat
K-pop love story feels so complete
Through the music dreams into ease
In the city, amidst the chase
Our hearts in rhythm, a swift pace
Bound together in this K-Pop space
K-Pop rhythm beneath the city light
Stirring within, amidst the chase
Our hearts in rhythm, a swift pace
Bound together in this K-Pop space
In the world of K-Pop love unfurls
The midsummer beats and the musical rolls
Under the snow sky as the melody twirls
In the beat of K-Pop love swirls
Live in yoga, K-pop love unfroze
The midst of beats and the musical walls
Somewhere the solar sky as the melody twirls
In the beat of K-pop love swirls
Feel the music, dreams interlace
In the city, amidst the chase
Our hearts in rhythm, a swift pace
Bound together in this K-pop space
K-pop rhythm, we meet the city light
Stirring within, our hearts divine
In this melody our souls sing
K-pop enchanting our hearts tonight
In the world of K-pop love unfurls
Amidst the beats in the musical worlds
Under the soul sky as the melody twirls
In the beat of K-pop love
