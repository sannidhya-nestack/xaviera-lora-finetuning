In that neon glow, hearts beatin' slow
We move together, our rhythm flows
Lost in the crowd, whispers aloud
Through the chaos, love is found
Two silhouettes against the city lights
In a sea of stars we ignite
In your eyes I find my way
With you my night turns into day
We're spinning in the melody
Caught in the tide
Underneath the moon
Side by side
Love like ours can't be defined
In this city of dreams, you're mine
Threads of destiny, weave in our story
In this dance we find our glory
Your touch electrifying, oh so sweet
In this rhythm, hearts skip a beat
We're lost in the neon, swept in the ride
Living our dreams with love as our guide
In this universe you and I collide
In the dance of light, in love we confide
In the city nights, as the time goes by
In your arms beneath the starry sky
As the daybreak dawns with your love divine
Our K-pop story stays in every line
