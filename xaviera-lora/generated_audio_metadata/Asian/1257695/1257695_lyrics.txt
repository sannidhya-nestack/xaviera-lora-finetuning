Living in a world that shines so bright
Underneath the neon lights, oh yeah, oh yeah
Chasing dreams in high-heeled shoes
Stuck into our own rhythm, breaking the rules
Can't stop the snow, we're on a roll
Silhouettes against the snow, skyline snow
Hands up, hearts beating in tune
Underneath the endless starry moon
We're dancing with the city in our veins
Oh yeah, chasing in your lines, we play the game
Stars align, we're ready to fly
Beneath the Seoul sky, we're alive
Late nights holding to the sound
City's heart is our playground (playground)
On crowded streets we find our song
With every beat we feel we belong
We're dancing with the city in our veins
Oh yeah, chasing needle lights we play the game
Stars align, we're ready to fly
Beneath the solar sky, we're alive
We're dancing with the city in our veins
Oh yeah, chasing neon lights, we play the game
Stars align, we're ready to fly
Beneath the solar sky, we're alive
As the night comes to an end
We know we'll dance again
Under the soul sky so bright
We'll trace those neon lights
Oh yeah, we're alive every night
Underneath the soul city lights
