Heartbeat, it's just a, stencil
Lost in, you can't tell, like a butcher
Comes bright, feels deep
In your arms, I'm into deep (I'm into deep)
Eyes meet, sparks ignite
In this moment, feels so right
I'm in the sun now
Whisper soft secrets, don't let you hear
Can't afford to charge up
Love bomb now
Let's force this love suicide
Hold on me, thank you, everything's right
모든 게 맞아
Stars above, moonlight glow
If you're here, time will flow
(Neurin siga)
Dreams alive, hearts entwined
In your love, I'm defined
(Nae sarangheo)
Words unsaid, feelings clear
I keep close my hand, no fear
두려움 없이, whisper sauce
Re-shading your love on me
할 수 있대, love on fire
Expose this voice inside
Fire on me, give you everything's right
모든 게 맞아
Fireworks, our skies catch alive
In our hearts, it's like we can burn
Bask in light, as you swim, your love's everywhere (she's out there)
Bask in light, as you swim, your love's everywhere
사랑이 가득해 (love bomb)
사랑의 폭탄 (explode inside)
Find your love, love's everywhere
사랑이 가득해
Love bomb (smile)
Don't expect it, it's a fire
They can't do everything right
모든 게 맞아
Fireworks for stars, there's a light
이 마음같은 flight 사람이 가득해
Love bomb
Love bomb
