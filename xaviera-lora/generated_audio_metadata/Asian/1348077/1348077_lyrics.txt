When I first met you things hadn't been going right
But you came along and turned color from black and white
I used to write my songs from the place of a broken heart
But that pattern changed and I knew it from the start
Now time has passed and we've had a life together
We've had our share of hard times and storms
We've had to weather
But even through life changes the feeling grows everyday
Cause you're in my life
This is what I say
I don't have to try
I don't have to lie
You are the reason
You're my reason why
I don't have to cry
I don't have to say goodbye
You are the reason
You're my reason why
Now time has passed and we've had a life together
We've had our share of hard times and storms
We've had to weather (weather, weather)
But even through life changes, the feeling grows every day
Because you're in my life
This is what I say
I don't have to try, I don't have to lie
You are the reason, you're my reason why
I don't have to cry, I don't have to say goodbye
You are the reason, you're my reason why
