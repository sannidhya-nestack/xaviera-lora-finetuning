Neon lights twinkle in soul's night
Music floating in enchanting sight
Your gaze captures me in the crowd so tight
This K-pop rhythm feels so right
K-pop heartbeat flowing in the air
Magic melodies none could compare
Our journey together no other could bear
K-pop love story beyond compare
Running through each other's dreams
Nothing in this world is as it seems
Bonded by a song the rhythm redeems
Our hearts in sync like beautifully woven seams
Heartbeats in harmony under the stars
K-pop's melody healing all our scars
The rhythm speaks, telling who we are
K-pop symphony, defining our memoir
K-pop heartbeat, flowing in the air
Magic melodies, none could compare
Our journey together, no other could bear
K-pop love story beyond compare
Heartbeats in harmony, under the stars
K-pop's melody healing all our scars
The rhythm speaks telling who we are
K-pop's symphony defining our memoir
Under the city lights
Loving K-pop style singing our hearts out
Mile after mile
This K-pop magic makes life worthwhile
In this music we lose ourselves for a while
