Underneath the night sky, just you and I
Dancing on reflections of the city lights
Feel like we're the only two who're alive
Seeing colors bursting through the starry sky
And this crazy world feels like it's just us
Wrapped up in your magic, feel the love rush
Your eyes are galaxies inviting me in
Lost in this moment, let the stars begin
We're dancing like dreaming, holding on tight
Lost in the rhythm, feeling the night
Your love is the music, makes me feel alive
Chasing the echoes of your heart tonight
Shades of love falling just like rain
Writing a story through pleasure and pain
In the pitch black night in the pouring day
With every heartbeat love leads the way
Ooh we're moving we're flying high as a kite
In the symphony of love you're my light
Your touch is euphoria burning so bright
Reaching for shadows of you in the night
And though we were flying high as a kite
Lost in the echoes, your heartbeat with mine
When the morning comes under the daylight
Our love song plays on, lost in the twilight
We're dancing, we're dreaming, holding, holding on tight
We're dancing, we're dreaming, holding on tight
We're dancing, we're dreaming, holding on tight
Lost in the rhythm, feeling the night
We're dancing, we're dreaming, holding on tight
Lost in the rhythm, feeling the night
But our love is the music makes me feel alive
Chasing the echoes of your heart tonight
We're chasing the echoes of your heart tonight
Chasing the echoes of your heart tonight
We're dancing, we're dreaming, holding on tight
Lost in the rhythm, feeling the night
