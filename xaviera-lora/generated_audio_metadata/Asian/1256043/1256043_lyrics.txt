In the bright lights of salt and night I found my heart lost in flight
Every step on these neon streets Feels like a drama's beating in my chest
Memories in every corner cafe Where we laughed so freely every day
Wished on stars across our rivers glow how cool
Could our young love ever grow old?
Our melody plays in the Soul City night
Reading through the bustling urban lights
Place our dreams on the dancing stars
Singing love songs for our hearts
Even if time keeps rushing, the days keep changing
Our song remains unwavering
Our Soul City love song
Sweet whispers shared in silent spaces
The beauty of your tender graces
Warmth of your hand guiding me through
In the city of dreams my dream was you
Stood under the numps and tower skies
Teardrops falling from your eyes
A promise made, a love so brave
Held in our hearts forever to stay
Our melody plays in Seoul city's heart
We love found its tender start
Under the blooming cherry stars
Sang our hopes and dreams afar
Even when life keeps moving, the world keeps spinning
Our story is just beginning
Our Soul City love song
From the glowing palaces to streets glistening with rain
In every beat of soul, in joy and in pain
Our love story's written in the city's song
A melody forever strong, our sweet soul love song
In the vibrant city tonight, my heartbeat feels so right
Each night in our paradise, under the neon city lights
In each moment we're together
Feels like it could last forever
Every whisper every laughter
Always chasing what we're after
In this rhythm of the night time
Our lives feel intertwined
Two hearts dancing in the rhyme
In this love that we find
Though the world keeps turning
Our hearts keep yearning
In every winter or spring time
A love redefining
In the soft glow of the moonlight
Your eyes shining so bright
Every secret shared in the twilight
Feels like our love is in flight
Under cherry blossoms falling
I hear your tender voice calling
Promise me a love enduring
Under the stars it's so alluring
In the rhythm under the city lights
Feeling your heartbeat next to mine
This love story written in the moonlight
Feels so perfectly divine
Even though seasons keep changing
Our hearts keep exchanging
True love that's so amazing in this rhythm
