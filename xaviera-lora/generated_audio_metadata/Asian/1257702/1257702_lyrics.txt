All I need to say is, it's alright
You and I shine the brightest tonight
Heart beating in our magnetic delight
Dreams fuse in our eyes, oh what a sight
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel the rhythm hold on so tight
K-Pop symphony our hearts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
My music flows just like a lotion
A life's melody in slow motion
Your smile works just like a potion
On my heart causing an explosion
Every beat, every line, every harmony
Draws us closer, this is our symphony
In the rhythm of our sweetest decree
We're in a twilight setting our spirits free
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel the rhythm hold on so tight
K-pop symphony our hearts in flight
This is the moment our time of light
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel the rhythm hold on so tight
K-pop symphony, hearts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
Music flows, it's a light, feel the moonlight
Feel the rhythm, hold on so tight
K-pop symphony, hearts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
Let's dance together under the moonlight
Feel the rhythm, hold on so tight
K-pop symphony, hearts in flight
This is our moment, our time, our fight
The music flows just like the ocean
Our life's melody in slow motion
Your smile works just like a potion
All my heart causing an explosion
The music flows off stage tonight
In this dance you might be in line
With every beat takes higher flight
In the drum of the city we ignite
Through rhythm and rhyme
We're defying space and time
Music binds us sublime
Your heart's melody in line with mine
The neon glow our stage tonight
In this dance you're my beacon light
With every beat takes higher flight
In the drama of the city we ignite
Through lead and through rhyme
We define space and time
Our hearts beat in a synchronized line
This K-pop melody is a sign
Underneath our glow on stage tonight
In the rhythm I find you
In this dance feelings renew
This K-pop song while our stories queue
As the song slowly fades away
In the dawn of a new day
Your love is my melody I dare to say
In this K-pop tune forever we'll sway
