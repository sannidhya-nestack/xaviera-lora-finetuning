In the city of red where the lights are dim
Pulse of the nightlife
Our hearts in a twine
Matching the rhythm just right
Our dreams unravel in the soul sky
The truth lies in your eyes
Every heartbeat, every sigh
Taking us high
We light up like stars in the throbbing K-pop night
Our passion, our scars, all are burning bright
Splashing colors, breaking free, life has no guarantees
Driving the rhythm, setting the sight, igniting the melody
Walking on neon paths, each song resonates and lasts
Silencing the chaos, fantasizing our past
In the symphony of our souls
We spin stories untold
In our rhythm and our rhymes our love unfolds
Shining bright, burning like the stars
In the K-pop world we reveal our memoirs
Pushing boundaries, blending lines
In the melody we align
With rhythm and time
We refine, we shine
In the city of lights, in the K-pop dreams
We soar through hypnotizing streams
Our dreams stand tall amidst the fantastical scenery
In rhythm and reality, we find our destiny
