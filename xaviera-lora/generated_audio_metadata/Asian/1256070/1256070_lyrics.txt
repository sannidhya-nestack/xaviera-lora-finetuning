Night falls all I see, under the source of light
Through the neon dreams we're dancing to the night
Echoes of laughter, whispers of love
Could this be the moment we've been dreaming of?
In the heart of Korea where the rhythm never sleeps
Bounded by the melody our hearts take a leap
Turning strangers into lovers, stories into songs
And the city of dreams is where we belong
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Under the moonlight however our secrets take flight
In the midst of the crowd we hold on tight
Through the music and rhythm we find our way
And so we celebrate come what may
Let the music play as we sway
Through the rhythm of soul we'll find our way
In the rhythm and blues, in joy and in strife
This is our song, this is our life
As the night fades and the dawn unfolds
We bid goodbye to the city that our story holds
Yet our song lingers, a sweet serenade
Until we meet again, until the memories fade
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Though we don't love ourselves
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Under the moonlight high river
Our secrets take the light
In the midst of the crowd, we hold on to the music and rhythm, we find our way, and so we celebrate, come what may, alone
