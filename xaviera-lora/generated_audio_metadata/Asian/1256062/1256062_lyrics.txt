Late night city lights were dancing in the rain
You and I side by side got nothing else to explain
Look into my eyes, see the stars begin to shine
Underneath this neon glow, your heart's becoming mine
We're lost in the rhythm, the music's our guide
In Seoul streets, with love we abide
Our story's a melody, sweet as the breeze
In this Korean pop song, we find our ease
Against the skyline, in the fast-paced flow
We are shooting stars, watch us glow
Through the beats of the night in the heart of the city
Your love is the chorus oh so pretty
We're playing our heart strings the notes flying free
In the pulse of soul we dance with glee
Through the beats of the night in the heart of the city
Your love is the chorus oh so pretty
Playing our heart strings the notes flying free
In the pulse of soul we dance with glee
Our tales and enchanting harmonious scream
In this Korean pop song you and me
As the rhythm in our heart strings
The notes flying free
In the pulse of soul we dance with glee
Our tales and enchanting harmonious scream
In this Korean pop song you and me
As the lyrics fade and the night's almost gone
In the midst of the city we'll keep holding on
the end of this sweep, musical esprit
We found our song in the heart of this city
