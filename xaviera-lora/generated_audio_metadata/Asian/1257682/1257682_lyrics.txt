I just need a look across the room, you catch my eye
My heart's beating like a drum, I wonder why
Can't make a reason why, you're always on my mind
Day and night, up in the stars, it's you I find
Dance with me under the moonlight
Hold my hands make it feel right
Underneath the city lights
Only you can ignite this night
Your mysterious eyes locked on tonight
This love we're feeling
It's a secret sign
Whispered words that can't be heard in the silence
Your heart is my world
Dance with me under the moonlight
Hold my hands make it feel right
Underneath the city lights
Only you can ignite this night
Just this moment just you and I
Moving to the rhythm as time goes by
The melody in my heart starts to play
In this dance of love what do you say?
Dancing the under the moonlight
Hold my hands make it feel right
Underneath the city lights only you can ignite this night
Your mysterious eyes locked onto mine
This love we're feeling
It's a secret sight
Whispered words but can't be heard
In the silence your heart is my world
Is my world
Just let me under the moonlight
Hold my hands make it feel right
Underneath the city lights
Only you can ignite this night
Can we spend this moment just you and I
Moving to the rhythm as time goes by
The melody in my heart starts to play
In this dance of love, what do you say?
this moment, just you and I
Move into the rhythm as time goes by
The melody in my heart starts to play
In this dance of love, what do you say
