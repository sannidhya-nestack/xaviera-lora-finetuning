Hey, how's your day been going so far
After work we let back maybe kopitiam or bar
In this little red dot we all combine
Different colors, cultures all align
La, le, lo, we sprinkle in our talk
Every sentence chiac like chili in a rock
Singlish la, it's how we speak
Mixing words every day of the week
In our hearts, it's where we belong
Singlishala, come and sing along
You don't need to be so kiazu
Life is short, must enjoy, don't you?
At the Hawker Center sharing our delight
From carrot cake to satay by the night
Can-may, can-la, we always find a way
Together we create a unique blend each day
Singlish-la, it's how we speak
Mixing words every day of the week
In our hearts it's where we belong
Singlish la, come and sing along
From Orchard Road to East Coast Park
We share our stories'til the sky turns dark
Under the same stars we laugh and thrive
In this harmony we feel alive
Singlish Law, it's how we speak
Mixing words every day of the week
In our hearts, it's where we belong
Singlish lah, come and sing along
So next time you hear our unique slang
Join in the fun, it's a Singaporean thing
So next time you hear our unique slang
Join in the fun, it's a Singaporean thing
