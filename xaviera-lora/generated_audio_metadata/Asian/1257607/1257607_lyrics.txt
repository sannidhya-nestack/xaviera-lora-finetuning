Caught in this shady light, your smile, your shine so bright
Dancing in the moonlight, your eyes filled with delight
Hand in hand this way, our hearts beating in tune
The rhythm takes us away under the silvery moon
We're flying high into the starry sky
Feeling the rush ready to touch the sky
With our hearts ablaze and dreams that never raise
In this swirling haze our love leaves a trace
Through the neon glow we move to rhythm slow
In the silent echo, a connection that continues to grow
In your embrace, under the night's face
We dance at our own pace, in a timeless space
In the cosmos of love, guided by stars above
We dance in the night, so light like a dove
In the harmony of the beats, where our hearts meets
In this melody of the streets, it's our love that repeats
Under the twinkling stars
Losing track of hours
In a world that's just ours as time devours
In this K-pop beat where love and music meet
Feeling so complete with you, life's so sweet
As the song fades away and the break of new day
With you my love I'm ready to face the fray
As our K-pop dreams play with each music ray
Together hand in hand we'll dance our worries away
With you, my love, I'm ready to face the fray
As our K-pop dreams play with each music ray
