Walking down the city streets
With your smile, I've got all I need
Through the laughter and the tears
We'll stay strong throughout the years
Echoes of your voice
Whisper through the breeze
Your love puts my heart at ease
In the rain
We'll dance'til dawn, side by side where we belong
The world fades around us just like a dream
Your hand in mine, life is a sweet theme
Each step we take, a path towards tomorrow
With you there's no sorrow
In your arms I'll stay forever
Leaving never facing the future together
Walking down the city streets with a smile I've got all I need
Through the laughter and the tears
We'll stand strong throughout the years
Echoes of your voice
Whispered through the breeze
Your love puts my heart at ease
In the rain, we'll dance till dawn
Side by side where we belong
The world fades around us just like a dream
Your hand in mine, life is a sweet theme
Each step we take
A path to tomorrow
With you there's no sorrow
Life is a sweet thing
In your arms I'll stay forever
Leaving never
Facing the future together
Oh, yeah
