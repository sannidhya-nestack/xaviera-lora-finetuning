Lights are bright, clouds are low, in the spotlight we enjoy (we are the)
Dreams tonight, in the rhythm we take flight, flight (ah)
Dreams tonight, in the rhythm we take flight (ah)
우리만 알잖아, 대가야 갈 거야
Eyes on us, hearts aflame
In the music we reclaim
이리는 듯 찾아
Dreams take flight
Souls ignite
In the darkness we shine bright
흐르는 반짝이 거려
I.P. (We are peace)
Center stage (신출된)
In the moment we engage
Hey! (We are peace)
어둠 벅차
Heaven, moon, sea, get with you
분명 의미 깊어 될 거야
Crowns of hearts in flight
In the music souls combine (이해를 영원히 가)
Dreams alive, spirits high
In the spotlight we amplify (우리는 증폭할 거야)
Eyes on us, spirits low
In the music we explode (우리는 잠을 못 자)
Dreams in night, hearts alive, in the darkness we shine bright
눈이 넌 반짝일 거야
I.P. R.I.P
Center stage, you should be in the moment, be engaged
I.P. 너는 박자 at the moon, take it with you
When we wake up, we're a new player
Through the highs, through the lows
Music, our passion falls
우리의 여정이 일어난다
In our hearts, through the beats
It is in the VIP, we find our seats
우리의 앞장을 찾을 거야
따라 us through the loss
In the music of passion flow (우리의 열정이 흐른다)
In our hearts, the rhythm beats
In the VIP, we fire
(4I.P 우리 아이티 센터 스테이지)
(신신무대 랩핀 너머 랩핀 엔게이지)
(Hey! 4I.P 너는 꽃이야)
(Every move 움직여 with you)
(We do it like that)
