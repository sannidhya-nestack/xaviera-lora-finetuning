Caught in the city lights, I saw you standing there
A graceful silhouette in the cold night air
We locked eyes in that moment, time stood still
In this heartbeat, see, against our will
Glide through the neon streets under the moonless sky
In Korea's hard white pants sitting
And your heartbeat against mine
Let us intertwine in this K-pop rhythm
Your love I'll enshrine
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm, mm, mm, mm
Ooh
Your whispers float in the air like a melody
Under the starlight there's nowhere else I'd rather be
We dance to the rhythm of our souls combined
In this pulsating city your love I have confined
We'll journey through the night under the earth and cold
Its souls embrace our loving bro
Through the breaking of dawn
Under the morning light
When this K-Pop blows on
I'll pass the line, right?
We'll journey through the under the morning's first ray
In souls embraced our love will grow
Through the breaking of dawn under the morning light
In this K-pop love song I'll pass the line right
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
As the curtain falls under the morning's first ray
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's K-pop so we should have sweat fade away
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the city of dreams under the sky so bright
Forever in this rhythm we dance into the night
