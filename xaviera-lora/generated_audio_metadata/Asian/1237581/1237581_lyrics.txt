Running through the shadows of my mind
Can't stand for it, searching what I can't find
Lost in ways of my own design
Stop playing in their mind, we left behind
Heart racing, lungs burning in despair
Drowning in emotions, gasping for air
Silent screams echo in the night
Fighting for freedom, longing for life
Gasping for air in a world so cold
Desperate for a lifeline, a hand to hold
Tears fall like rain, a silent prayer
Lost in the darkness, gasping for air
The spirits of doubt in the silence of the night
Casting for air, consumed by a fright
Shadows dance, a haunting sight
Struggling to break free to find the light
My scent, a swelling in storm
Lost in the chaos, feeling torn
Screaming into the void, now I'm dead
Fighting for survival, gasping for air
In the depths of despair, I find my strength
Rising from the ashes, I'd go to any length
I breathe in deep but darkness fades
Cast away the moonlight away
Cast before it in the light our way
Cast before it in the light our way
Lost in the darkness cast before it
