Dancing through the crowd on a neon light
Feeling your heartbeat, hiding in the sights
In the city, the never sleeps are up again
In the heart of Seoul, it's where our story ran
In the rhythm of the night, our hearts are soaring
With the city skyline, our love story is right
In every beat, in every rhyme and line
Our love is the rhythm, our melody's divine
Caught in the moment, under the darkest sky
Your eyes hold galaxies you'll never can't deny
In the quiet corners of the bustling town
I'll whisper secrets, I'll love sweet sound
As the city lights glow, casting shadows around
In eyes full of galaxies, a love I can't deny
In the quiet corners of the bustling town
I'll whisper secrets, our love sweeps down
As the city lights glow, casting shadows around
In our innocent hearts, love is the only sound
In the stints of life, in this urban run
We found our beat, we found our town
In the rhythm of song, as the music plays on
Two souls in a city from dusk'til dawn
In the city of dreams, underneath the walls glow
In everything our love continues to grow
