Through the balance and the pain of your love, it's what I'll sing
With you I have no fear, everything becomes so clear
Whispers under the midnight sky, promises that we'll never deny
In this dance of destiny, only you and I forever will try
With every moment you give me a reason, your love feels like the warmest season
You and me, a perfect melody, heartbeats in harmony
In your arms, I found my home
Never again feeling alone
To the end of the world, I will follow love so deep
It'll never be hollow
Through the valleys and the peaks
Your love is what I seek
With you I have no fear
Everything becomes so clear
Whispers under the midnight sky
Promises that were never denied
In this dance of destiny
Only you and I
Forever we'll try
Every moment you give me a reason
Your love feels like the warmest season
You and me, a perfect melody
Heartbeats in harmony
In your arms I found my home
Never again feeling alone
To the end of the world I will follow love so deep
It'll never be hollow
It'll never be hollow
In your arms I found my home
Never again feeling alone
The end of the world I will follow
Love so deep it'll never be hollow
Hollow
