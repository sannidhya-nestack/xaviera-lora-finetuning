In the heart of home, where the light shimmer bright
Found you in the crowd, my radiant light
Together we wander through a neon midnight
In the rhythm of the city, lost in endless sights
In the city of dreams, under the moon's soft glow
Caught up in the rhythm, in the up and flow
K-pop beats pulsing, the melodies embrace
Together in the rhythm, calling love's chase
Down by hangang, under the stars
In our hearts a symphony beyond all scars
In soul's hustle and bustle, we found our song
In our shared rhythm, we truly belong
Under the stellar sky, our song takes flight
In the city of dreams, everything feels right
Soul city beating in sync with our heart
In the melody's rhythm we'll never part
As the dawn breaks in the city of love
Our song fades to the heavens above
Yet in every sunset in soul's timeless glow
Our song is on in the rhythm, you know
Down by Hong Kong
Under the stars
In our hearts a symphony beyond all scars
In souls hustle and bustle we found our song
In our shared rhythm we truly belong
Under the stellar sky our song takes flight
In the city of dreams everything feels right
Soul city beating in sync with our heart
In the melodies rhythm will never part
As the dawn breaks in the city of love
Our song fades to the heavens above
In every sunset, in Seoul's timeless glow, our song lives
