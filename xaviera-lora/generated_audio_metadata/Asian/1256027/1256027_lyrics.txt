Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the heart of Seoul
Under the neon glow
Got a story to tell
Ready to unfold
Making dreams in a gold skyline
Where stars align
Living in a high tide
One shot electrifying the night
Our heartbeats sinking in the city's light
Two hearts dancing as one
Our love story and soul has just begun
Strumming strings of destiny
Our melody in the city's symphony
Among the bustling crowd just you and me
In this urban love story, we are free
One shot painting the town red
Our heartbeats can't be misread
Two souls entwined under the moon
Our love song in soul will play soon
In the rhythm of the city beat
Our hearts meet and yet they compete
In our dance under the city lights
We claim the night we reach new heights
One shot, bringing us closer to heaven
With every pulse, becoming more clever
Two hearts, tuned to this song
In soul, that's where we belong
Under the neon glow
In the heart of soul
Our love story forever to extol
This is our song
This is our tale
In the heart of soul
Love will prevail
Da-na-na-na-na
