Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the heart of soul underneath all new glow
Your laughter is a melody setting my heart aglow
With dreams in our pockets and stars in our eyes
In this rhythm of the night our spirit flies
Let's dance to the beat in this city of lights
In a world where our dreams take flight
We move, we sway in this K-pop delight
Come and hold me close, let's own the night
Every verse, every note
Whispers your name
In this melody of us
Love is our game
With the rhythm as our guide
And the music our voice
In this K-pop symphony
We made our choice
So sing it out loud
Let the world hear
This song of ours
Crystal clear
In a universe of sound, our hearts unite
In this K-Pop dream, we ignite
As the magic fades with the rising sun
Our melody lingers, our song isn't done
With you it's more than an illyrical spree
This K-pop love is our destiny
Let's dance to the ground
Let the world hear lights in a world where our dreams take flight
We move, we sway in this K-Pop delight
Come and hold me close, let's own the night
Every verse, every note, whispers your name and name
In this melody of our slave life
Come and hold me close, let's own the night
Every verse, every note, whispers your name
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Every verse, every note
Whispers your name
And a heart of soul underneath on glow
Your laughter is a melody setting my heart aglow
With dreams in our pockets and stars in our eyes
In this rhythm of the night our spirit flies
Let's dance to the beat in the city lights
In a world where I can say
