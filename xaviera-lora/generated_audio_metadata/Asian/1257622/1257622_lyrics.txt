In the city of dreams, set aside like dreams
Dance all night, chase what your heart deems
With every beat, feel the rhythm in your feet
In a world of K-pop, we're never offbeat
Feel the pulse, feel the K-Pop vibe
In this rhythm, we all jive
Moving, grooving, it's our worldwide tribe
In the K-Pop scene, we don't need a bride
Dreams are placed under neon rays
Through the highs and the lows our spirit stays
In the silence of the night our music plays
In the heart of K-pop the magic array
Can you feel the passion, the K-pop beat?
Dance in the rhythm, oh it's so sweet
With the melody ringing, let your heart repeat
This K-pop song that makes you move your feet
In this K-Pop journey of dreams and light
Chasing stars through the music of the night
Our voices unite in perfect flight
In this K-Pop world, we dance with delight
