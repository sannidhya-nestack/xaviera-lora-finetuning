In la van!
Woo!
Do you think it's cool
Rating girls from one to ten
Maybe you're a two
When we do that to men
Rate someone nickel or dime
The score might fit
It might sound fickle but I'm about to admit (Listen up)
When I'm with you (When I'm with you)
I have one confession
When I'm with you (When I'm with)
I'm luckier than seven when I'm with you (when I'm with you)
I'd die and go to heaven'cause you make me feel
Like a lover (a lover)
Some say love is a numbers game (you didn't say there'd be math)
A brush with faith, so you fan the flame (fire)
I could not care less what they say (say what?)
Call it poison, I'll drink it anyway
And beg for more when I'm with you
I have one confession when I'm with you
I'm luckier than seven when I'm with you (when I'm with you)
I'd die and go to heaven'cause you make me feel
Like a lover, oh (like a lover)
Like a lover, oh (like a lover)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
