Diamonds in my tears, fire in my soul
Left me in the cold, now watch me take control
From the ashes I rise stronger than before
Mess with a heartbreak queen, you'll be begging for more
Queen of revenge, don't you dare et
Every lie you told, every tear I wept
Turn the tables, watch me reign supreme
Regret the day you closed this heartbreak, queen
Through pain and hurt found the power
In the darkest hour
Loomed a leaf and flower
To the town where the scars you left behind
Lose what was blind, see what you'll find
Queen of first blind, see what you'll find
Queen of revenge, see what you'll find
Cruel, what was blind, see what you'll find
Queen of revenge, don't you dare et
Every lie you told, every tear I wept
Turn the tables, watch me reign supreme
Regret the day you crossed this heartbreak
We threw pain and hurt from a power
In the darkest hour
Loomed a revenge flower
To the town where the scars you left behind
Post-mortem find see what you find
Quench your fire, feel the burn
Heartbreak, watch it rise
Quint
