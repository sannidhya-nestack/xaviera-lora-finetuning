Yeah, yeah, OMG, Exana
In the shadows of our love I wait alone
Echoes of your lies like a haunting tone
우리 사랑의 근진자 속에서
너 혼자 기다리고 있어
너의 거짓말이 사무치는 소리처럼 들려와
In the depths of my heart is still you near
But you're not like poison
I feel it, 너 마음이 깊은 곳에서
너를 느껴지만 너의 사랑은 독일 뿐이야
Wait for your love trapped in this endless night
In the darkness I'm losing the fight
너의 사랑은 독일 뿐이야
I've been waiting for you in this endless night
I'm losing myself in the darkness
In the silence of my tears you are beyond fear
But I touch your touch like ice
It fills me with fear
You appear in my tears
하지만 너의 손길은 얼음처럼 차가워
In the depths of the wasps, it's me we fear
나의 눈물 속에서 뭐가 나타나
하지만 너의 손길은 얼음처럼 차가워
So my heart is feeling near
But your love like poison
I've been in a love, deep inside
I feel you, but your love is just giving up
Wait for your love trapped in this endless night
In the darkness, I'm losing my sight
I'm waiting for your love, in this endless night
In the darkness, I'm losing myself
In the silence of my tears, you're in your deepest thoughts
Your touch like ice fills me with infinite fear
My emotions are moving faster now, in the distance
I see your silhouette, but reaching you I can't et
Mori sa no e shiruetsu na
너가 나타나 하지만 너의 손길은 얼음처럼 차가워
In the depths of my heart I see you near
But your love like poison I feel
내 맘 깊은 곳에서 너를 느껴지는 너의 사랑은 독일 뿐이야
Pray for your love trapped in this endless night
In the dark, there's someone's in the dark
너의 사랑이 기다려 있게 끝없는 밤 속에서
어둠 속에서 나는 스스로를 잃었다
In the silence of my tears, you're all I have given first
Your touch, my eyes, fills me with this bliss here
Now you're in my soul, it's all moving faster now
You're in my soul, it's all moving faster
