In the field of dalgi (strawberry)
We found our lemon
Sweet and sour, a perfect blend
Like the sun and the moon, we collide
In this dance of flavors, side by side
Two niye hearts beat as one
Saram shines like the morning sun
Together we'll face this storm
Yeongwonhi in each other's arms
Strawberry juices, lemonade dreams
In a world of sugar and creams
All the foods like a flower in the sweet and sour
Take these pills under the sky, so close
No, I'm not in your love, so true
Limousines gonna live so sweet
So I need every heartbeat
Like a candlelight, you shine so bright
In a world of doom and delight
You are my guiding light, light
Like a bird in the night, you shine so bright
In a world of gold and delight
You are my guiding light
Like a dance under the sky so blue
No, I'm not in love, so true
Lemon zest on your lips so sweet
Sun in every heartbeat
Left a girl in the night
You shine so bright
In a world of gloom and delight
You are my guide light, light
Shady fields under the sky so blue
No one out in the love so true
Lemon zest on her lips so sweet
Sarang in every heartbeat
