Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Losing the maze of the city
I'm lost in the rhythm
While the lights paint in stories
I quest for the freedom
In this lonely room
I'll find my solace
With my passion ablaze
I'm chasing my oasis
Can you hear my heartbeat
It's beating for you
I'm lost in your melody
In every single tune
Catch my breath
Catch my whisper
In this chorus of life
Let's dance together
Oh, oh, oh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm
Underneath the skyline, amidst a million stars
Finding the rhythm between all the bars
With the music so loud, yet it's you that I hear
Under this kaleido sky, our song is clear
Can you feel the rhythm, it's calling you
