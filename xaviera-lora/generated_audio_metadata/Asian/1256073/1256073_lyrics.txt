In the souls of your lights, under the moon's glow
I found myself wondering, where did our love go?
The rhythm of my heart beats like a drum
Missing you in my soul, a silent hum
In this Korean pop, I sing a tale of love
You're the melody that I've been dreaming of
Even if you're far, you're playing in my heart
This song of love is a work of art
On the dance floor where we used to shine
Now I'm all alone lost in the rhyme
Your voice in the music
Your laugh in the air
Without you it feels so bare
In the Korean pop
My love is so true
Every beat, every note is all about you
This song won't stop
It plays on and on
In my heart you are never gone
So this is my song under the Korean stars
In every note I feel where you are
Even if the music stops my love won't fade
In this Korean pop our love forever stays
