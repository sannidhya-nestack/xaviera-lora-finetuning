In the midnight glow of death neon lights
Lost in the rhythm feels so right
Your eyes sparkle like the stars above
I can't help but fall, is this love?
In soul city nights, in the K-pop flame
In hearts beating wild like a secret flame
In the rhythm of love, in the dance and the song
With every beat with the crowd we belong
The melody flows like a whispered tale
In every word and every note we sail
Your smile, a rhythm in my heart
This is our stage, let the music start
In soul city nights, in the K-pop dream
In hearts running free like a secret theme
In the rhythm of love, in the dance, in the song
With every beat, with the crowd, we belong
The melody flows like a whispered tale
In every word, in every note we sail
Your smile, a rhythm in my heart
This is our stage, let the music start
In soul-sitting nights from the K-pop dream
And hearts running free like a secret theme
In the rhythm of love
In the dance in the song
With every beat
With the crowd we belong
Sway with me in the moonlight
Hold my hand feel the rhythm feel the night
This is our song
This is our dance
In the K-pop glow
We'll take our chance
In soul-sitting nights
In the K-pop flash
In hearts burning bright like a secret crash
In the rhythm of love, in the dance in the song
With every beat'til the break of dawn
In the echo of a song, in the fading light
In soul city nights we found the night
In rhythm and dance, in K-pop in the crowd
Under the neon lights we found
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
