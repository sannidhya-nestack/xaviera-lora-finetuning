Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
In the glow of city lights I roam
Finding solace looking for a home, home
My love do you wait for me alone, alone
Or have your eyes in another heart, no, oh
Korean pop, we will make our hearts stop
Love stories sung from a rooftop
Through music, sweet rope swing, we will hop
Together we will rise to the top
Underneath the cherry blossom snow
Our hearts beating in a rhythm slow, oh
In the language of love, we're poets, oh
Writing lyrics that for you only flow, oh
Korean pop like a soft soda pop
The sweet symphony will never flop
With every beat, every note, we won't stop
Until that day our dreams hit the jackpot
In the near maze, love will guide our ways
Join me in this dance, et the strays
In harmony and stress, the world sways
In the tune of our love, the melody plays
Korean pop, where we make our hearts stop
Our stories sung from a rooftop
Their music's sweet world swing
We will hop together, we'll rise to the top
Underneath the cherry blossoms, snow, oh
Other rhythms magic your hand in mine, oh
In the language of love, we're poets, oh
Writing lyrics that for you only flow, oh
Under lyrics of the night, stars align
By the rhythm's magic, your hand and mine
Our symphony resonates love divine
In this melody we weave forever entwined
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the neon maze love will guide our ways
Join me in this dance et the strays
In a harmonious twist
The world sways in the tune of our love the melody plays
In the neon maze love will guide our ways
Join me in this dance et the strays
In a harmonious twist
The world sways in the tune of our love the melody plays
In the neon maze, love will guide our ways
Join me in this dance, et the strays
In our harmonious twist, the world sways, the world sways
On the tune of our love, the melody plays
