I wrote about us
Now what about me?
You like to complain
It's more than just a game
Oh, you like to whisper
About those sexy nights
When you didn't need to ever turn out the lights
And busy you've gone
Never far away you say it's where I belong
Ooh, those sexy nights will stay
We kept on the lights so we could just play
Is that all we have? It ain't no damn good but I always want you back
Not white or black, as serious as a love heart attack
Uh, I know it don't matter what I say
Where you gone, you're gonna stay
It don't matter much anyway
Where it is, you're gone
you'll never bid farewell
My soul will never tell us farewell
Ever from where you say it's where I belong
Ooh, those sexy nights will stay
You kept on the lights so we could just play
Is that all we have? It ain't no damn good but I always want you back
Not white or black, as serious as a love heart attack
Is that all we have? It ain't no damn good, but I always want you back
Not white or black, as serious as a love holiday
