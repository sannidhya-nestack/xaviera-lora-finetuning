In the neon lights, walking on my dream
Caught up in the beat, in this rhythm deep breathe
Just you and I, lost in soul city's stream
It's a dazzling sight, like a star's gleam
We dance, we sing, in the K-pop ring
In the melody, we find our beam
Underlying words to your heart cling
Tell me do you hear that love we bring
Moonlight showers, hundreds flow
You are my world, my dreams in your eyes they glow
In the crowds, hustle time seems to slow
Will each be our love continue to grow
We dance, we sing in the K-pop ring
In the rhythm of feelings we're swimming
Each note is alive with our hearts beating
Tell me can your soul feel this healing
So here's our K-pop ballad to the moon
Two minutes serenade ending too soon
But in every beat, in every tune
There's a promise I'll see you soon
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
