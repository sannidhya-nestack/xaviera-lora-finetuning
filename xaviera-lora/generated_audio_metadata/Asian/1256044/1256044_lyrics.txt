Look into my eyes, you will see the sky
Walking hand in hand under the city lights
In our secret place where the love's no lie
Baby it's just you and I, shining so bright
We are like stars in the night
Sparkling so bright
In this misty dance called love, you're my light
We're dancing'round the moonbeams reaching the high
In the rhythm of our hearts feels so right
With your laughter's melody
Night turns into the day
A love symphony
Echoing far away
In the crowd
Your voice is my favorite sound
When you say my name
Feel my heart break down
We're chasing dreams in the neon light
So intense
Borrowing whispers from the wind
Feels immense
Let's paint the town with our love
No need for pretense
In this Korean pop fairytale
Love's only defense
We are like stars in the night
Sparkling so bright
In this mystic dance
Come love, you're my light
We're dancing on the moonbeams
Reaching the height
In the rhythm of our hearts
Feels so right
With your love, this melody that turns into the day
Our love symphony echoing far away
In the crowd, your voice is my favorite sound
When you say my name, feel my heart beat'round
We're chasing dreams and me
We're chasing dreams in the neon lights so intense
Borrowing whispers from the wind feels immense
Let's paint the town with our love, no need for pretense
In this Korean pop fairy tale love's only defense
Underneath the cherry blossoms promise you'll remember
Always in my heart from January to December
Our love song echoes like a sweet surrender
In this K-pop love story you're my only member
Underneath the cherry blossoms promise you'll remember
Always in my heart from January to December
A love song echoes like a sweet surrender
In this K-Pop love
