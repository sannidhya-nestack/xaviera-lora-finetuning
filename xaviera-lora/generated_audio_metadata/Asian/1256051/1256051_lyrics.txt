An umbrella tops all tonight, I felt my heart lost in flight
Every step on these neon streets
Feels like a drum is beating in my chest
Memories in every corner of cafe where
We laughed so freely everyday
Wishing stars across hundred rivers glow
How could our young love ever grow old
Our melody plays in this old city night
Weaving through the bustling urban lights
Place our dreams on the dancing stars
Singing love songs for our hearts
Even if time keeps rushing
The days keeps changing
Our song remains unwavering
Our soul city love song
Sweet whispers shared in silent spaces
The beauty of your tender graces
Warmth of your hand guiding me through
In the city of dreams my dream was you
Stood under the Namsan tower skies
Teardrops falling from your eyes
A promise made, a love so brave
Held in our hearts forever to save
Our melody plays in Seoul City's heart
Where love found its tender start
Under the blooming cherry stars
Sang our hopes and dreams afar
Even when life keeps moving
The world keeps spinning
Our story's just beginning
Our soul's city love song
From the glowing palaces to streets
Glistening with rain
In every beat of soul
In joy and in pain
Our love story is written in the city song
A melody forever strong
Our sweet soul love song
In the vibrant city tonight
My heartbeat feels so right
Each night in our paradise
Under the neon city lights
Each moment we're together
Feels like it could last forever
Every whisper, every laughter
Always chasing what we're after
In this rhythm of the nighttime
Our lives feel intertwined
Two hearts dancing in the rhyme
In this love that we find
Though the world keeps turning
Our hearts keep yearning
In every winter or springtime
Our love redefining
In the soft glow of the moonlight
Your eyes shining so bright
Every secret shared in the twilight
Feels like our love is in flight
Under cherry blossoms falling
I hear your tender voice
