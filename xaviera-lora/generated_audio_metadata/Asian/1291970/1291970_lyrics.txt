Morning MRT won't kill me
So many people
Squeeze inside the train but we also steeple
New bubble tea shop, queue until can see
Must be damn good, come join in quickly
Queue up, queue up, we don't shy
Singapore style, queue till sky
From coffee shops to concert lines
Queue up together, everything fine
Flash sale online, midnight we await
Finger on the button, don't wanna be late
But when the store opens, system hang
Never mind, lah, we refresh, can
Queue up, queue up, we don't shy
Singapore style, queue'til sky
From hawker stalls to taxi rides
Queue up together, hearts align
Lucky draw at mall, prizes to win
Queue so long but we join in
Chat with stranger time pass fast
In this queue, friendships last
Queue up, queue up, we don't shy
Singapore style, queue till sky
From movie tickets to new phone sign
Queue up together, we don't mind
Some say can't, some maybe can
But queuing's part of who I am
With patience and a smile so wide
We share this journey side by side
Queue up, queue up, we don't shy
Singapore style, we queue'til sky
From dawn'til dusk, rain or shine
Queue up together, feeling fine
