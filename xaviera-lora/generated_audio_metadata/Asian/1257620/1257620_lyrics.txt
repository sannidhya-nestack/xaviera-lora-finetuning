Holding up and so we're burning bright
Underneath the city lights never felt so right
You and me dancing in the midnight air
Trying to catch the moment that's beyond compare
We're dreaming in neon colors
So surreal
Heartbeat sinking in the rhythm
It's a magical ordeal
No need for words
Our eyes convey the feels
Caught up in this K-pop love
It's our escapade on real
Roaming in the gangnam streets
Heart so free, whispering your secrets, saranghaeyo to me
Underneath the moonlight, your hand in mine
In this vibrant city, our love story intertwines
We're caught in the rhythm, K-pop's in a race
In the city of soul where love forever reigns
Created our own universe, no need for terrains
We're dancing to the K-pop beat
Love without any strains
So let's close our eyes, promise not to fade
In the city of dreams, our K-pop serenade
In the rhythm of soul, where love is self-made
We're dancing to the rhythm, our K-pop escapade
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we're dreaming in neon colors
So surreal, heartbeats sinking in the rhythm
It's a magical ordeal, no need for words
Our eyes convey the feels
Caught up in this K-pop love
It's our escapade unreal
