In the vibrant city lights, we lose ourselves tonight
Dreaming dreams of vivid colors under the black velvet sky
Caught up in the rhythm, our hearts beating as one
In the scent of morning calm, where our story has begun
Walking down the neon streets hand in hand
Feel our love igniting in this frozen land
To the song of the night
In the soft moonlight
We're dancing in the rhythm of love
Let's make it right
Underneath the Han rivers glow
Whisper secrets unknown
Promises etched on our hearts like the melody of our song
Getting behind the city's face
Find the story that we chase
In the harsh of twilight's grace
Our love never missed a place
Soaring through the cherry blossoms under the small sky
Buried in the star dust trails let the world pass by
In the hush of twilight as the city sleeps tight
We're swaying to the rhythm of love under the moonlight
As the dawn breaks our fairy tale takes flight
In the land of K-pop magic under the soft morning light
Walking down the neon streets, hand in hand (hand in hand)
Kingdom of the midnight ink, instrument (instrument)
Feel the summer night, in the soft moonlight
We're dancing in the rhythm of love, let's make it right
Oh, oh, oh
Let's take a ride, oh
Let's take a ride
