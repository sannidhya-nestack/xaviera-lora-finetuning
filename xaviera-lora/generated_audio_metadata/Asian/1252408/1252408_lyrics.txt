In the still of night, let the moon aglow in the sky
I think of you, your smile my lullaby
The quiet streets I roam, seeking your face
In the dance of shadows, I feel your warm embrace
Stars whisper secrets, tales of our love
Bound by fate, written in clouds above
Remember the day when we first met
Time stood still, our hearts forever set
Holding hands we walked along the shore
With every wave I loved you more
Dreams intertwined, like lines so tight
Together forever in this eternal night
In the still of night, with the moon aglow in the sky
I think of you, your smile my lullaby
The quiet streets are old, seeking your face
In the dance of shadows, I feel your warm embrace
Stars whisper secrets, tales of our love
On my fate written in clouds above
Remember the day when we first met
Time stood still, our hearts forever set
Holding hands, we walked along the shore
With every wave, I loved you more
Dreams intertwined, like lines so tight
Together forever, in this eternal light
Dreams intertwined, like lines so tight
Together forever in this eternal night
