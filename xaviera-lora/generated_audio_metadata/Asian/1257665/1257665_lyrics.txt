Shadows hurt through the red and laughs and laugh
In the neon glow we're lost in the city lights
This beat in our hearts it's a melody so bright
In our feverish dreams we soar into the highest high
In the swirl of the stars we paint our own constellation
Though the world spins around we found our orientation
Don't lose the beat let's catch this creation
In the ballet of the night we find our liberation
Echoes of our love rings through the midnight air
Who says we don't belong?
For us life isn't fair
Look me in the eyes
Can't you see how much I care?
With the rhythm of our hearts
There's nothing we can't dare
In the swirl of the stars, we paint our own constellation
Though the world spins around, we found our orientation
Don't lose the beat, let's catch this creation
In the ballet of the night, we find our liberation
