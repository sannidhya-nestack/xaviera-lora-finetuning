Neon lights on a starless night
Two hearts lost in a soul-soul sight
In the city where dreams won't sleep
Finding love and promises we'll keep
Oh, soar, you light our way
In your arms we sway
When the stars replace the city lights
The moon up, outshining the night
And the hustle pace never slows
Between skyscrapers love grows
We dance through streets paved with gold
Our younger selves feeling bold
In the city that's always in motion
We find peace in this commotion
Oh soul where dreams can't fight
In your heart we unite over the heart
The city shines in your eyes lost lines
Amidst the crowd of symphony
The city's rhythm sets us free
In soul
Under the city's glow
Two hearts beat tempo
In the rhythm of the night
We shine bright our souls light
In the hustle, pace never slows
Beneath the stars, love weeps
Singing our soul city serenade
In love's melody, our hearts play
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When the hustle pace never slows
Between skyscrapers love grows
We dance through streets paved with gold
Our younger selves feeling both
In the city that's always in motion
We find peace in this commotion
Show the soul that dreams take flight
In the heart we unite
Over the hum, the city shines
In your eyes, lost lines
Amidst a crowd of symphony
The city's rhythm sets us free
Over the hum, the city shines
In your eyes, lost lines
