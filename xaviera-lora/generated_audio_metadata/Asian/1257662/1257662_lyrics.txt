Lost in the city, under the neon lights I find my heartbeat
In the reflection of a thousand dreams, my soul in every street
With every step, a different melody, every glance, a euphoria
Oh, we're the dreamers
Catching fire in the moonlight
Spelling our desires
On the canvas of the night sky
With music as our language
In melodies we converse
Lost in our dreams
In the universe
In the stardust, your silhouette dancing with mine
Between the skyscrapers, our hearts intertwine
Under the moonlight, we're weaving a fantasy
A symphony divine
Oh, we're the adventurers painting tales in the starlight
In every rhythm, every note, we find our flight with harmony as our guide
Across dimensions we traverse, lost in our journey
In the universe, in the blink of an eye
In the rhythm of the city life
In stories untold, in whispers of the night
