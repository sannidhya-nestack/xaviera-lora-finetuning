In the city lights our story begins
Caught in the rhythm a dance that spins
In the hustle of soul where dreams take flight
We found each other in the neon light
We're riding high on the city wave
With each beat our hearts we save
In the rhythm of love we rise above
This is our soul, the city we love
By the Hangang river, under the starry sky
In your eyes, reflections I spy
Hand in hand in this urban expanse
Soul is our song, life is our dance
Beneath the tower in the cityscape
In these moments love takes shape
In the rhythm of soul we find our role
Nothing can fill this city soul
In the cobblestone streets my footsteps echo
Our hearts connect, they crawl and let grow
As we dance in the harmony of sleepless nights
In soul, our love ignites
In the heart of Seoul, where love unfolds
A celestial dance, the city holds
In the rhythm of the night under the moon's glow
This is Seoul, a city spectacle show
In the city of dreams, our love stands tall
For it's always a melody that beguiles us all
This is our story, in soul's divine light
A Korean pop song, bringing love to the night
