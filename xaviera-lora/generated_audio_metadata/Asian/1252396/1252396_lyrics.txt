In the moonlight, glow of hearts sink in time
I am yours and you are mine
The stars above illuminate our way
No need for words, our hearts convey
Through the highs and the lows we'll always stay
Never letting go, come what may
Your smile, it lights up the darkest night
In your embrace everything's alright
We'll soar high, like the kites
Love's infinite heights
Together facing all the fights
With every beat, our love will grow
In this endless flow
Through every high and low
In the moonlight glow
Hearts sink in time, I am yours and you are mine
The stars above illuminate our way
No need for words, our hearts convey
Through the highs and the lows we'll always stay
Never letting go, come with me
Your smile, it lights up the darkest night
In your embrace everything's alright
We'll soar high like the kites of infinite heights
Together facing all the fights
With every beat our love will grow
In this endless flow through every high and low
We'll soar high like the kites,'round infinite heights
Together facing all the fights
With every beat, our love will grow
In this endless flow, through every high and low
With every beat, our love will grow
In this endless flow, through every high and low
