In the dark, my mind, my mind is high
Whispers in the dark, a secret song
Healing softly with eyes that gleam
That catch me out, a mysterious dream
A mysterious dream
A silent snap, something that pulls the gleam
They cast me out, a mysterious dream
A mysterious dream
Silent steps on the girls they dream
They cast me out, she'll never scream
Captivate
These girls tell she'll captivate
She'll captivate
Whiskers twitching, a knowing glance
In her eyes, the moon's self-trance
A creature of the night, feline grace
The cat's meow, in every space
Mysterious ways
I know it's there
She roams the night without a care
Invisible threats of the night's love
Cat's meow, she'll take a bow
Cat's meow, she'll never space
Mysterious ways, mysterious ways, a knowing stare
She runs the night without a care
Invisible threads of the night spell
Catch me out, she'll take a bow
Can't smell, I'm a night queen
And shadows dancing by the sea
Whispers of magic, whispers of fate
That catch me out, should captivate
Whispers of magic, whispers of hope
In her room, where mysteries unfold
Catch me out so I just fill your heart
Can't smell
I'm the night queen, in shadows dancing that I see
Whispers of magic, whispers of rain
They catch me out, she captivate
