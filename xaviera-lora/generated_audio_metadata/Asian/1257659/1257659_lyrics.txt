Walking down these hidden lights, how long? (How long?)
So tonight in your eyes I see a sign, makes my heart ignite
In the chase of our K-pop dreams
In the melody and the hype it screams
We're dancing through life it seems
Living for these passionate things
Caught in the beat, lost in your smile
Walking hand in hand, mile after mile
Underneath the stars' sparkling file
These moments make it all worthwhile
In the heart of a Varkade plot song
In the place where we truly belong
We're living our dreams, we're strong
Singing it loud all night long
In the flashlights and the glitter and gold
In the stories that have never been told
In every dream that we hold
We are young and we are bold
In our K-pop world so grand
In the rhythm of this dreamy band
Hand in hand across this land
For each other we'll take a stand
In the soft hum of the K-pop tune
Underneath the glowing moon
In the heart of the night in June
We'll meet again and not a moment too soon
In the heart of our K-Pop dreams
In the melodic glowing moon
In the heart of the night in June
We'll meet again and not enrollment too soon
