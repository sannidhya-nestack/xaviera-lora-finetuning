The memories fade, time slips away
In your heart, I hope to stay
Echoes soft, whispers glist clear
In your mind, I linger near
Days go by, seasons change
In your thoughts I rearrange
Silent night, stars above
In your dreams, having your love
너의 사랑 (너의 사랑)
너의 사랑 (너의 사랑)
Remember me
Keep hold me tight
In your heart, I'll shine so bright
(I've been drinking wine)
Letters sent, words unsent
Letters sent, words unsent said
In your soul, I've always tread
(I'm survival)
Memories old, moments new
In your life, I'm your hue
너의 색깔
Songs we sang
Paths we trod
In your heart
밤 년 날
내리끄덕인
Whispers of promises kept
In your love I've deeply slept
깊이 잠들어
In your mind I linger near
내가 가까이
Days go by, seasons change
In your thoughts I rearrange
Silent night, stars above
In your dreams I'm your love
I found this nail care
In your heart
I did this nail care
Once I said
In your love, I deeply slept
(Deeply, deep sleep)
Remember me
(Remember me)
Hold me tight
(Hold me tight)
In your love, I deeply slept
(Deeply, deep sleep)
In your mind, I linger near
(I linger near)
