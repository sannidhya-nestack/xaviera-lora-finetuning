한장 잊고 떠나는 사랑
We're dancing in the Seoul city lights
Sweeping past the stars tonight
This rhythm got me feeling just right
In this love we speak in melodies
Vibes so high we touch the galaxies
A serenade our hearts woven tight
In the K-pop world we unite
Strumming chords of emotion deep
Our dreams are the promises we keep
In cartels on this melody sheet
In our hearts we're passionate and rhythm-y
In this love colors explode in the night
With every beat we are in flight
Through the universe our song takes sight
In the K-pop world we unite
In this love colors explode in the night
With every beat we are in flight
Through the universe our song takes sight
In the K-Pop world we unite
Moonlight dreams a symphony in our hearts
Step by step to the rhythm of the stars
In the echoes of the night
We whisper stories under the city lights
In this love, every beat paints a new delight
Dancing through time with power in mind
Our song echoes in the brilliant night
In the K-pop world we unite
As dawn paints the skyscrapers gold
Our K-pop stories will be told
In this rhythm we unite
Under the same moon
Under the same light
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Underneath the diamond sky
We're dancing in the soul city
