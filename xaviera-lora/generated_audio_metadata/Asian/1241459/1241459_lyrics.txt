Okay
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
As unknown shadows cast
In the night our future's vast
(무서워하지마)
Footsteps light hearts are bold
In the dark our story's told
(Do it)
Eyes meet, dare to dream
In this moment, hear my scream (let the dream)
Whispers of secrets hide
And your soul will reside
Negai sul goya
Follow if you dare
I will take a chance
Hwihwe reul jabwa
In the unknown we'll dance
Soge chumchuja
Stars above, moons of glow
In your heart I aim to show
내가 보여줄게
Dreams we chase, paths we find
In your mind, I'm inclined
너와 같이
That's right, the story's all tales untold
In your thoughts, I unfold
(Juh juh juh)
Whispers of the past
Promises made in your love, I'm not afraid
두려움 없이 follow if you dare
따라와 보며 take a chance
In the end, you'll never be spared
뺏어 떨어지지 마
With me, you'll never be stuck
Don't fall for me (Follow if you dare)
I wanna take a chance, grab the chance
In the unknown, we'll dance, let's dance
Follow if you dare
Follow me if you dare
Follow if you dare (I wanna)
Take a chance, grab the chance
With me, you'll never be stuck
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
날 계속 떨어지지 마 (Follow if you dare)
따라와, take a chance (기회를 잡아)
Baby, I know we'll dance (우리 춤추자)
Follow if you dare (따라와, follow me)
Follow if you dare (따라와, take a chance)
기회를 잡아 (Baby, you'll never be stopped)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
