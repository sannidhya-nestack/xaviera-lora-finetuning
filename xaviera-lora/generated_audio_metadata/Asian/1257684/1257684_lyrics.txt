I dream that I'm turning city lights
Walking alone dreaming about you
Caught in this rhythm my heart's so bright
The stars can't help but shine around you
You're like K-pop in my heart, music in my soul
Got me dancing in the daylight everywhere I go
In the rhythm, in the movement, in the beat that never stops
You're the melody that pulses, you're my favorite K-pop
On silent streets beneath the moon's glow
Shadows dancing lost in thought you know
In the soft light where dreams may grow
Feel your heartbeat let's take it slow
You're like K-pop in my heart music in my soul
Got me swaying in the moonlight everywhere I go
In the rhythm in the movement in the beat that never stops
Through the melody that pulses you're my favorite K-pop
On silent streets beneath the moon's glow
Shadows dancing lost in thought you know
In the soft light where dreams may grow
Feel your heartbeat let's take it slow
You're like K-pop in my heart music in my soul
Got me swaying in the moonlight everywhere I go
In the rhythm in the movement in the beat that never stops
You're the song that's ever playing you're my favorite K-pop
As the night fades, the dawn wakes anew
Gonna dance to a rhythm beneath the sky of Peru
You're the K-pop in my heart
Play until it's lost, lost in your love
Caught in this K-pop
In the city of dreams, lost in the lights
Feeling the rhythm of the starlit nights
Your smell's a melody, pure and bright
It keeps on playing from dusk'til light
You're my K-Pop, my perfect song
In every beat and every throng
With every move we just go on
Together we dance all night long
In the quiet whispers of the moon
Eclipsed by your laughter none too soon
Your voice a symphony in perfect tune
A song of love beneath the maroon
You're my K-pop, my melody
In every lyric, in every spree
With every note, just you and me
In a world where I'm meant to be
Through every chorus, every single rhyme
In your arms I lose the sense of time
You're my K-pop, my timeless rhyme
In our love song that's so sublime
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
