Not part of the second, where the lights never fade
Found a love so pretty under the skyscraper shade
Through the streets we wandered, lost in the rhythm's flow
In the heart of Seoul we watched our dreams grow
Underneath the neon lights, you and I took flight
Found a love so enchanting
In every song and sight
In this city of dreams
Where love echoes and gleams
Found a melody that streams
In our shared and lonely themes
In the bustling gap now
We dance to our tune
Our love lit like lanterns
Under the sole moon
Over the bridge at Han River
Our whispers turning into song
In this city and each other's arms
Is where we truly belong
Together in the depths
Vibrant trends lost in a solo dance
We found our chance in this gay potpourri
We wrote our own story, found a harmony
In those endless, endless blurry
As the sun sets and the city dims its lights
We hold on to love, that power of fights
And with the city our hearts beat
In this small soul our love is complete
