And make the soul skylight
The dreams intertwine
Through the rhythm, through the rhyme
We ignite the divine
In the city's heartbeat
With the moon up above
I found my rhythm, I found my love
In the neon glow
Under the starry veil
Love blooms in the night
Telling our tale
In rhythm and in rhyme
In every step, every move
In this K-Pop vines
We find our groove
In the lively streets
Where our echoes collide
In rhythm and in love
Let our souls glide
As we hold to the beat, lost in the city's charm
In the heart of K-Pop, I found your arm
Among the city lights, under the moon's gentle sway
With every beat and rhythm we dance the night away
In the city of dreams, where love and music unite
In the heart of K-Pop, I found your arm
Among the city lights
Under the moon's gentle sway
With every beat and rhythm we dance the night away
In this city of dreams where love and music unite
In the heart of K-pop we light the night
As the dawn breaks, we welcome the daylight
In the rhythm of soul, love feels so right
Underneath the sunrise, our story takes flight
In the land of K-pop, we dance in the morning light
In the neon glow, under the starry veil
Love booms in the night, telling our tale
In rhythm and in rhyme, in every step, every move
In this kick-off
