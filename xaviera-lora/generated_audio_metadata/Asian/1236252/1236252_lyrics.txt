In fields of green, a wildflower blooms
Young hearts entwined in this magical place
Whispers of love carried by the breeze
Two souls dancing under the trees
청춘의 사랑 (I can feel it)
Pure and true
별이 달에 (And me and you)
이제 (Love so new)
한마음이 된 우리 (Together)
Together as one through and through
White flower, flower, through it together as one through
White flower, a clone in my heart, your love's embrace
Shine inside of us, our days with grace
Can't get over one key of death, and there's no such ending place
Forever entwined in love's embrace
Under the moon's gentle glow
These white promises whispered in the night
We'll stay
Hearts beating as one under the stars
Your love's journey, no boundaries, no bars
정신을 살아 (정신을 살아)
우린 추가 기다래 (우린 추가 기다래)
And me and you 이 돼 (And me and you 이 돼)
Never seen love so new (Never seen love so new)
한 마음이 되는 게 (한 마음이 되는 게)
Together as one through and through
Wildflower, bloom in my heart, your love's embrace
Charming sun, paints our days with grace
향기로운 기억들, there's this enchanting phase
Forever entwined in love's embrace
