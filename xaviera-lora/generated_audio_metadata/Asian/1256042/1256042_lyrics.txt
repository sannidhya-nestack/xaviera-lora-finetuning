In this heating let it see eyes are mine
Underneath the stars our hearts intertwine
Lost in the music we found our eyes
Our love story begins
Measured in time
In this rhythm of Korean pop
In this melody our hearts won't stop
Catching our dreams and reaching the top
With the beat of our hearts we'll never drop
Through crowded streets or footsteps online
We both know that we shine
With each beat we're crossing the line
Your hand in mine makes everything fine
In this rhythm of Korean pop
In this cadence our hearts won't fall
Catching our dreams and reaching the top
With your melodic voice you make my heart pop
In this dead escape under the moon's glow
Our love story continues to grow
In this Korean pop tempo we sway and bop
Holding each other close we steal the show
In this rhythm of Korean pop
In this cadence our hearts won't flop
Catching our dreams and reaching the top
With your melodic voice you make my heart pop
In this cityscape under the moon's glow
Our love story continues to grow
In this Korean pop, tempo is swaying'bout
Holding each other close, we steal the show
