Found it in the town, yeah, yeah
Lost in the digital haze
In the crowd I found
Swipe through the faces
Searching for the profound
In the thick fog
Found among people
I swipe through the faces
Looking for something deep
In the sever and the scroll
Looking for a spark, spark, spark
The more I swipe
Feels like I'm stuck in the dark
In the meaningless screw
I try to find a ray of light
But the more I swipe
The more I'm trapped in darkness
Swipe right seeking the match for the night
In this digital game, I feel like I'm trapped
Swipe right seeking the match for the night
In this digital game where I stay quiet
To the right, swipe
Let's find the match for this night
In this digital game where my heart flies away
The more I search, the more it's out of sight
True connection lost in a slight smile
하지만 더 찾을수록 더 사라져
진정한 연결 수화의 배인 속에서
In this pixelated world
Where love's on command
Swipe through the options
Holdin' it in my hands
다소 많은 세계 속에서 사랑은 요구되고 있어
Option, this is what? 하면 내 손에 들고
In the virtual field looking for a sign, a spark
The more I swipe, it feels like I'm falling behind
In the sea of fantasy, I'm looking for a chance to shine
But the more I swipe, I feel like I'm being trapped
Swipe right, seeking the match for the night
It's digital gang, I feel like I'm trapped
Swipe right, seeking the match for the night
In this digital game where I stay flight
오른쪽으로 수화해
이 밤을 위한 매치를 찾아자
마음이 날아가는 디지털 게임 속에서
But the more I search, the more I set aside
True connection lost in the slight flight
하지만 더 자주 쓸
