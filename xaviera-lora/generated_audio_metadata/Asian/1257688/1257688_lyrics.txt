In the heart of Seoul, under the young glow
You and me holding hands, we're ready to go
Running through the night like a beautiful dream
In this city of lights, we're the biggest team
Living in the rhythm, the alpha song
In this K-Pop dream, it's where we belong
We're catching every note, we're singing all night long
In this K-Pop dream, we never felt so strong
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Shadows playing tricks in the light of the moon
In every alleyway we find a new tune
The echoes of our hearts beating in sync
In the canvas of the night and the city's pink
Living in the rhythm, the beat of our song
In this K-Pop dream is where we belong
Emotions running high love never felt so strong
In this K-Pop universe we just can't go wrong
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
So here's to us, to our love so bright
Underneath this old city lights
In this K-Pop dream we're taking flight
Into the endless story night
Living in the rhythm in the beat of our song
In this K-Pop dream is where we belong
We're catching every note, we're singing all night long
In this K-Pop dream we never felt so strong
In the beat of our song
In this K-Pop dream is where we belong
Emotions burnin' high love never felt so strong
In this K-Pop universe we just can't go wrong
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh just can't go wrong
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
So here's to us, to our love so bright
Underneath the Seoul city lights
In this K-pop dream we're taking flight
Into the endless starry night
