Walking down the streets of Seoul tonight
Underneath the neon city light
I see your face amidst the crowd
Hoping that you'd turn around
Our love story started on this lane
Tears are left with joy and pain
But now it's only me and the rain
Calling out your name in vain
Come back, bring back
Let's fall and stop
Our love is not distant, not very far
Give me a chance, I've been missing you
In this Korean pop, I sing this for you
Memories in this antique Korean air
Your soft whispers, your tender care
But as the music starts to play
You're gone, you're miles away
Come back, bring back
This fallen star
Our love is not distant, not very far
Give me a chance, I've been missing you
In this Korean park, I sing this for you
Memories in the scent of Korean air
Your soft whispers, your tender care
But as the music starts to play
You're gone, you're miles away
Come back, bring back
This moment and start
Our love is not distant, not very far
Give me a chance
I've been missing you in this Korean park
I sing this for you
So here I am in the soul's highlight
Missing you feeling every heart's light
In this Korean love I sing my heart out
Hoping my love you will know, darling
