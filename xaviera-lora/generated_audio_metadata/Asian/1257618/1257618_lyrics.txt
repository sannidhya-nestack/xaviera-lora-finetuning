기다리어는 night we found our way beneath the stars we chose to sway in the rhythm of the night and the music's played our hearts ignite
In this K-pop ballet
Dancing together as the beat drops
On this journey that never stops
In the pulsating art of the city that shops
We found our rhythm in K-pop
Your eyes, they twinkle with city lights
Our shared laughter taking us to new heights
In a world that's ours, defined by city nights
Love flourishing under the neon lights
Lost in the rhythm as the melody pops
Into a dance, our heartbeat stops
In the city of dreams as the rain drops
Underneath the sky, the K-pop non-stop
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
In the silence between the beat, there's a rhythm so discreet
A melody, pure and sweet, our love story in a K-pop beat
Caught in the music as the bassline hops in the city of dreams that never mops
Under the stars, the K-pop nonstop, our hearts all love in each K-pop top
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-Na, na-na-na-na-na, na
As the final note plays, the city sleeps
In the music, our memory weaves
Under the sky, love speaks
In the city, K-pop forever keeps
It taught me on the nights we flung away
Beneath the stars we chose to sway
In the rhythm of the night and the music's play
Our hearts ignite in this K-Pop ballet
