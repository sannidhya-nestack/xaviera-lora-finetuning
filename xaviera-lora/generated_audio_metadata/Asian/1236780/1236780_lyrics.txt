Another city where we roam
Underneath the neon lights that shine
Lost in time we found our glow
In the place we used to call our own
Moonlight dances on the streets
Whispers of the past we keep
Hearts beating to a rhythm sweet
In the place where memories meet
Me with me
Oh, the place where memories meet
Oh, in the city where the stars align
Where your hand felt perfectly mine
Every corner tells a story I know
Of the place we used to go
Of the place we used to go
Twilight falls
The world outgrew
Footsteps that go down the roads we know
Left the windows in the gentle breeze
In the place where we found peace
시간이 흘러도 우리 사이
영원히 이어지는 추억 속에
이 도시에서 우리 마음이
영원히 함께 하는 곳
Oh in the city where the stars align
Where your hands fit perfectly in mine
Every corner tells a story I know
Of the place we used to go
Of the place we used to go
