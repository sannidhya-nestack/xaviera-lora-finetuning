In shadows, we shine bright like diamonds (diamonds)
No fear, we rise above the silence
Passion in our souls, we stand tall (okay)
And power queens break free from a wall
In naman beorcheoreom, like a shining star
Realize the night
한 걸음 더 나아가 (One step further)
절대 포기하지 않아 (Never giving up)
In control, 강한 여자들
Strong women with fire in our soul
Diamond warriors, heroes more
강인한 여자 살들 (Oh)
빛나는 diamonds (And diamonds)
We're taught together, unbreakable
Within our mind
Courage as a long know we face the storm, Mercado and Cadillac (our blades)
The trials we remain fear (Gendarmes)
Resistance through the unity we persevere
Inalienable like a shining star, we light the night
한걸음 더 나가 (One step further)
절대 포기하지 않아 Never giving up in control
강한 여자들 Strong women with fire in our soul
Diamond warriors here as well
강인한 여자사람들 (For)
빛나는 diamond (Diamond)
We're together unbreakable
We're number one
Live it up more
바람 뚫고 걸어가 (breaking through the wind)
We'll never fall
희망의 노래를 부르면 (singing songs of hope)
Standing tall
강한 마음으로 (strong hearts)
We'll pave the way
세상을 변화시키며 (chew, work, work)
