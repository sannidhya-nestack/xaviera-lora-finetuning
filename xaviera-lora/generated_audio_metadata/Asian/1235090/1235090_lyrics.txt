In the battle of life, we stand tall
Facing struggles, we give our all
With courage in our hearts, we fight
Through the darkest of night
Marking all our souls
We rise, strength and honor in our eyes
In this war we face each day
Together, we'll find our way
In the war, we are together
We fight together with courage
Everyone remembers us
We are one on the battlefield
The war pattern on our skin
We face each other with a strong heart
If we are together, we can win
Like heroes buried in the battlefield
Through the fire, we merge strong
In the chaos, we'll right the wrong
With unity as our shield
Together we will never yield
We rise, strength and honor
In our eyes, in this war we face each day
Together, we'll find our way
In the war, we are together
Be brave and fight together
Everyone remembers us
We are one on the battlefield
The war pattern on our skin
We meet with a stronger heart
If we are together, we can win
Like a hero buried in the battlefield
