Your smile lights up the night, outshines the starry bliss
In the silent whispers of love, it's you I miss
Your laughter echoes in the wind
Sets my heart in a twist
In this dance of destiny
It's your love I can't resist
You're my love story painted in the sky
In the book of my heart, it's you I glorify
Through the rhythm of our dreams, you're my high
In the melody of love, it's us, you and I
Your touch sets my heart aflame
In this moment divine
With the echo of your name
Our love intertwines
Under the blanket of stars
Your light always shines
In this love song of ours
You're the perfect rhyme
You're my love story painted in the sky
In the book of my heart, it's you I glorify
Through the rhythm of our dreams, you're my high
In the melody of love, it's us, you and I
In the prism of love, our story beautifully unwinds
In the symphony of stars, it's your love that binds
