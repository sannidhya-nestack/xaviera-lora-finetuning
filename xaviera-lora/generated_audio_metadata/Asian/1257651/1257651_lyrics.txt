In the slashes of city lights we found our way
Feeling the pulse, we let the rhythm swing
Underneath the moonlight, illuminating the night
Young and free, we set our dreams to fly
So hold my hand as we chase the stars
In this K-Pop tour
We find who we are
Lost in music
Feeling the beat in the heart of soul
Where dreams and reality meet
In the rushing wave of neon signs
We dance, we laugh, lost in time
With every beat, every melody known
We ride in harmony
Sailing in same boat
Embracing the rhythm
Under the city glow
With our K-Pop tune, letting our emotions flow
Come escape with me in this dance so divine
Where love and music and dreams intertwine
As the city sleeps, the echo fades
Yet in our hearts, the K-Pop tune still plays
In every beat, in every line, we'll always find
