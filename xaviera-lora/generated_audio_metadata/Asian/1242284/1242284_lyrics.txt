On top of a silver moon, we tread
조심히 shadows 춤추는 in the darkness
In silence 속삭임 float 이스태프 조심스러 moving in the night
We 공유하다 두려움 희망 꿈은 night
보여주는 취약성 beneath our facade
Eyes wide open
Navigating the obsidian eye
답을 찾아서 in the unknown
In stillness
We are found in this chaos
우리를 둘러싼 us
A sliver of hope in the dark
A beacon cutting through darkness
With every breath heartbeat drawn closer
I'm wavering
It's going on and on
그림자 리어정
Turn into 착다 away
Away it come into 착다
Echoes of Guadalingo haunting reminders of trials faced yet in darkness
King found resilience, or just stacked against us
Rising spirits, unbroken determination
Bian haji annun annun
Eyes meet, silence, understanding
공유된 연결, transcending words
In darkness, 위로 found in presence, reminder we're
혼자가 아닌 united, standing against forces
우리를 떨어뜨리고 go
A sliver of hope, 빌만 때마다 go
A center of hope
