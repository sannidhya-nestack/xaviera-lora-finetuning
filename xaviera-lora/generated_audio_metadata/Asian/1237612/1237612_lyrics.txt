Stepping to the unknown, no take my hand
Mountains of dark are across the land
Whispers of the wind calling on my name
In this wild journey, no two paths are same
As sun shines, the sky's so bright
In each other, we find a good guy
Adventure awaits around each bend
In this story, together we're meant
Adventure, our hearts are like
Underneath the stars shining bright
Through valleys deep and forests grand
Hand in hand we'll make a good start
Sunrise painting the world anew
In the morning light
Dreams come true
Footprints left on sands
Attending this adventure
Your hand in mine I'll be the second saint
Lessons to cross bridges to
Lessons to learn at each turn of earth
Adventure beckons, to this we roam
In the wild unknown we find our home
Adventure, a high-told lie
Underneath the sky shining bright
To the valley's deep and far it's grand
Hand in hand, we'll make it through this day
In the toughest year of life we weave
Each moment an adventure to believe
With courage as our trusted thief
In this journey we'll find what we seek
Venture our hearts out of line
Underneath the sky shining bright
Through valleys deep and forests grand
Hand in hand we'll make it through the stand
