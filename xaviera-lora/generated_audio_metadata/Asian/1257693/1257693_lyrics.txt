Kick start my heart with your love
Sparkle in your eyes brighter than the stars above
Dancing in moonlight feeling so right with you
Every night turns into magical sound
We're young, we're free
Let's set our hearts ablaze
Walking together in life's beautiful maze
Chasing dreams
Wild as the sea
In this rhythm, we'll forever be
Underneath the city lights, stories untold
In your warmth, I find my stronghold
Whispered secrets, laughter in the air
In this moment, nothing can compare
We're young, we're free, let's capture the days
Chasing the sunset in its scarlet haze
