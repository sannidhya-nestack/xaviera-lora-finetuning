Raindrops tap on my rooftop, a soothing tune
Reminds me of late afternoons
Sitting with you under the same old tree
Where you and I felt so free
Our laughter echoed through the air
A connection beyond compare
In a world that moves so fast
With you, time always lasts
Even the rain couldn't wash away
The memories we crafted each day here
Your smile, a beacon in the storm
With you right here, I feel warm
Dancing in the rain without a care
Our hearts a love song so rare
We dream of places far and wide
A love that refuses to hide
Raindrops fall but we stand tall
Knowing in you I found it all
We'll face each ordeal come what may
Together forever come what may
