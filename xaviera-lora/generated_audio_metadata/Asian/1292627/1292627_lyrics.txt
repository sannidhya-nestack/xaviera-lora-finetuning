Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We can come seek you so long
At the shop there we all belong
By our numbers hope can strike
Dream big dreams maybe tonight
Chasing lucky numbers hope can win
Heart beating fast feel within
In this game we all the same
Sing together call our name
Ngong a ma they also try
Share old stories time passed by
We laugh together under the sun
In this moment all is one
Chasing lucky numbers hope can win
Heart beating fast feel within
In this game we all the same
Sing together call our name
Win or lose still we smile
Tomorrow come try new style
Not just money it's the fun
In this place we are one
Chasing lucky numbers
Hope can win
Heart beating fast
Feel within
In this game
We are the same
Sing together
Call our name
Some say waste time
We say no
Together we stand, let it show
Hopes and dreams we all share
In this journey, show we care
Chasing lucky numbers, hope can win
Heart beating fast, feel within
In this game, we are the same
Sing together, call our name
