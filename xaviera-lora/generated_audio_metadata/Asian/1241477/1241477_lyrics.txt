In the heat, flames ignite
너의 눈빛 burning bright
Blows first off hearts of flames
너와 함께 I'll embrace
I speak 너와 나
In this fire 우리 다시 태어나
손을 잡아 take the leap with you
너와 나 we'll keep it wave in the night
Mo wa hamuke ahojai
Every touch, every spark with you
Mo wa na ae bark
In your arms, passions rise
내 맘속 널 손잡아
Promises made, flames entwined
너와 함께 our love defies
Eyes locked, 너와 나
In this fire, 우리 다시 태어나
손을 잡아 take the lead with you
너와 나 we'll keep it brave in the night
너와 함께 I hold tight
Every touch and every spark with you
너와 나 I embark
Through the waves, through the haze
너와 함께 I will stay
In your warmth I'll find my peace
너만을 위해 our love won't cease
Heatwave in the night
너와 함께 all night
Every touch, every spark with you
너와 나 I embark
