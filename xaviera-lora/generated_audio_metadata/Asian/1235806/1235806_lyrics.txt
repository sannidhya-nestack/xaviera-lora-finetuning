Mud in the green field, sky so blue
Friends laughing, pure and true
Innocence in all we knew
Giggles echo in the breeze
Summer days and the seas
Rainbow memories, colors bright
Childhood dreams taking flight
In our hearts those memories thrive
Hide and seek in golden light
Imagination taking flight
Cotton candy skies above
In our hearts, endless love
Playgrounds filled with joy and cheer
Days of laughter oh so, so dear
In our hearts endless love
Playgrounds filled with joy and cheer
Days of laughter oh so dear
Rainbow memories colors bright
Tears may pass, but we'll hold tight to the magic of childhood light
In our hearts forevermore
