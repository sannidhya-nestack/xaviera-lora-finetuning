Underneath the starlight, there's a dream within my eyes
In the city of neon, we are brighter than the sky
Come and follow my heart, let it beat to the rhythm
In this love symphony, we ain't stopping'til midnight
Stars flying high, in this puzzle of destiny
Hear the whispers of the night, it's our shared fantasy
In this kaleidoscope world, we dance all through the night
Though the world is ending, our love is in full flight
Stop the rhythm, let's make this moment right
Let's chase the moon under this shining city light
Sailing through the twilight
Our echoes fill the air
Reflections in crystal dreams
Doesn't matter when or where
Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Is it the same love rhythm that makes you complete in me?
In this kaleidoscope world we dance all through the night
Though the world is ending our love isn't full flight
So don't stop the rhythm let's make
This moment right
Let's chase the moon
Under this shining city light
Now the sun's coming up
I'm dance fading into the light
But our love's a single promise
We'll keep going through the night
In this kaleidoscope world we found our perfect sight
Always remember this moment our love caught in moonlight
In this kaleidoscope world we dance all through the night
Though the world is spinning our love is in full flight
So don't stop the rhythm let's make
It's on the rise, let's chase the moon under this shining city light
