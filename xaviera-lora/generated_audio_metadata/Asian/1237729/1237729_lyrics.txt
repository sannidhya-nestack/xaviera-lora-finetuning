Into the room all eyes follow
My heart flutters, the light dims
His smile a radiant force in his arms
My fears dissolve
My boy, my anchor, my beacon
In his presence the world aligns
Through challenges and calm he remains
His love guides me
His laughter, a melody in chaos
His embrace, my sanctuary in adversity
He stands firm
I find stability in his affection
My boy, my strength, my compass
In his company, peace resides
In trials and triumph he endures
Love illuminates my path
Side by side, confront the darkness
In his gaze I discover clarity
Together we conquer the heights
And his affliction combines our foreign
My boy, my foundation, my light
In his presence tranquility reigns
Through thick and thin he stands by me in his love I never came
