Waking up in the city of dreams and lights
Heart beats fast ready to take flight
Can't explain but turn the music high
The rhythm takes over ready to fly
Feel the beat drop as we rise
In the swirl of all you know disguise
With the neon lights we ignite
This K-pop dream, star of the night
Confidence high, walk in a different light
Music is our language, passion like a flame
In a world where you create your path
With all the love shouts, enjoy the laugh
Feel the beat drop as we rise
In this world of all to know disguise
With the neon lights we ignite
This K-pop dream, star of the night
[Outro music]
This love for music's in our veins
As we dance and sing etting pains
Owning the stage creating our story
In the world of K-pop we bask in glory
Feel the beat drop as we rise
In this world of all to no disguise
With the neon lights we ignite
This K-pop dream, star of the night
As loveful music's in our veins
As we dance and sing etting hates
Owning the stage creating a story
In the world of K-Pop we bask in glory
Feel the beat drop as we rise
In this world of all to no disguise
With the neon lights we ignite
This K-Pop dream, star of the night
The music slowly fades away
In our hearts, the rhythms stay
In the city of dreams, under the neon lights
This K-pop dream, a star burning bright
