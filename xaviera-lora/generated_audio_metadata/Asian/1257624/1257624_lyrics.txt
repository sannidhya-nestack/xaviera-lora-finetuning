From living in the rhythm, feeling the beat
Running through the city with the world at our feet
Throw your hands up, let the music play
We can keep popping our hearts and we're here to slay
Cutting the spotlight, under the clear night
Moving to the melody, what a beautiful sight
Your eyes are shining like city lights
This moment with you feels just right
In this K-pop universe we're dancing free
Running down the dreaming streets just you and me
In the city lights under the starry sea
This is where we're meant to be
Your laughter is a melody in this crowded city
A symphony that makes my heart feel pretty
Your presence beside me is my clarity
In this world of K-pop you're my serenity
Together we run under the setting sun
In this K-pop world where fantasy has begun
Where dreams come alive in the city's hum
In the rhythm in the night we've become one
In this K-pop universe we're dancing free
Running down the dreamy streets just you and me
In the city lights under the starry sea
This K-pop anthem it's what our hearts have built
Under the universe, in the city-sea
In this rhythm, in this night we found our melody
In this K-pop dream, you and me are the key
In the city lights, we found our liberty
