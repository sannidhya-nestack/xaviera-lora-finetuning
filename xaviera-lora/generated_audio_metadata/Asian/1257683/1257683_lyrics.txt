Under, underneath the city lights, a world that's color bright
Stars are shimmering in your eyes
That should have felt so right
But we're alright
We're reaching out into the night
Following the vibe, oh
Nothing ever felt so alive
Makes us wanna dive
We're dancing through the hills
Hearts in sync over thrills
I'm the impossible that chills
In a flow that never spills
We are the melody
That's alive in every beat
With a rhythm that makes you move your feet
Streetlights over our heads as we take every stride
A melody that's in our heads, it's an endless ride, oh
An echo that's playing on repeat, it's a magical feat, oh
We're dancing to the beat, makes us feel so elite, oh
Shadows can't keep us away
We're the dawn in a fair day
Thunder can't drown our tune
We're an everlasting moon
We're the rhythm that's alive in every heart
We're the keyboards that will never part
An echo that won't fade away, lingering night and day
The rhythm that's here to stay, it's our K-pop way
We're the echo that becomes the sound
We're the rhythm that goes round and round
We're the K-pop that's breaking the ground
A symphony that's truly profound
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dancing through the hills
Hearts in sync over fills
Only it pops while it chills
In a flow that never spills
We are the melody
That's alive in every beat
We're the rhythm that makes you move your feet
