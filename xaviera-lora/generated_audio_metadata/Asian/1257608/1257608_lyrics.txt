Underneath the neon lights
We are dancing in soul tonight
Feeling the rhythm lost in the city's charm
Across the sleepy dreaming world
Our music is unfurled like a melody
I want to hold you in my arms
In this steady night
Let our hearts unite
This moment is fleeting like cherry blossoms in the breeze
Just catch my eye across the crowded room
And I'll know it's you
And oh with you I feel at ease
Across languages and time zones
No matter how far we roam
The beat of our hearts match the rhythm of this song
Through struggles, dreams and heartbreak
For our love's sake
You and I in this together forever strong
In this sea of dreams amidst the night gleams
Our love story's told in the rhythm of this dance
