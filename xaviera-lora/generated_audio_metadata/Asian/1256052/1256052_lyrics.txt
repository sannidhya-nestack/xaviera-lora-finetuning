Bungin' on the city lights, I'll burn to glamour
Two hearts collide, feel it simmering
Quiet whispers echo, promises to keep
In dreams so deep, where love is brimming
Let's sail through the night on a melody
Just you and me, in our own symphony
We will fly our tail in the stars up high
Under the Korean sky, love is our only decree
Lovers in the night, chasing fleeting hopes
Lost in a city of lights amongst the blossom flowers
Invisible ties, they bind us together
Any weather, we'll shine forever
So let's dance to the beat of our hearts
Carving our paths in a rhythm that never hurts
These moments are awesome, the moonlight we twined
In a K-pop song, a love divine
So let's dance to the beat of our hearts
Carve in our hearts in the rhythm that never parts
These moments are ours in the moonlight we twine
In our K-pop song our love divine
So here we stand against all odds
In this time our souls rhyme
In our shows of life in the rhythm of the night
In the neon glow in our Korean pop song
We let love show
Lovers in the night, chasing fading hours
Under the Korean sky
Love is our Caribbean villain
Lovers in the night, chasing fading hours, hours
Lovers in the night, chasing fading hours
Lost in a city of lights
On roads that blossom flowers
Invisible ties, they bind us together
In any weather, we'll shine forever
So let's dance to the beat of our hearts
Carving our parts in a rhythm that never pause
These moments are ours and the moonlight we twine
In our K-pop song our love divine
So here we stand against all odds in this time
