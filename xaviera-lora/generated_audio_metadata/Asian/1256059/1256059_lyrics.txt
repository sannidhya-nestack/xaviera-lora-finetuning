Beneath the city lights I'll find my pace
Your name engraved in every corner, every place
We're dancing on the edge in this space
In the rhythm of the night we embrace
K-pop melody, we'll take the stage
Our hearts on beat, feel the rage
In the city of dreams we engage
This is our moment, our golden age
Under a thousand stars I see your face
The music moves us in a lover's chase
Your laugh, a song in all its grace
This love story the universe will trace
Korean pop, a symphony so grand
With every beat together we make our stand
In this cityscape our destiny planned
Together in harmony we expand
Through souls, music, our hearts entwined
Your love in every verse, every line
Together we rise in this K-Pop shrine
This melody of love, forever mine
Under a thousand stars, I see your face
The music moves us in a lover's chase
You'll laugh a song in all its grace
This love story the universe will trace
Korean pop a symphony so grand
With every beat together we make our stand
In this city scaped by destiny planned
Together in harmony we expand
Through souls, music, our hearts entwine
Your love in every verse, every line
Together we rise in this K-pop shrine
This melody of love forevermore
