나는 버터지는 김치 (Oh, whoa)
Walking down the street
Color the city lights
Feeling the rhythm
The love of the sight
Seeing your shadow dance
In this bright moon
Won't you say hello
But it's too soon
Call me in love
And the heart won't stop
Falling in love
Skipping home
Least into the beat
Going non-stop
Call me in love
And the heart won't stop
Staring at you across the dance floor
Want to know you but you're just a faux pas
Captivated by the melody feeling so free
Each moment, it's where we should be
Cool me up, in the heart won't stop
Falling in love, sleep and call
Sweet melodies, like a rain drop
Cool me up, in the heart won't stop
So just tonight, under the neon lights
Korean pop playing, lifting our cries
Caught in this rhythm, feel so right
Korean pop, our love at first sight
Going non-stop, going non-stop
In the heart, won't stop falling in love
Skipping hop, listening to the beat
Going non-stop, going non-stop
In the heart, won't stop
