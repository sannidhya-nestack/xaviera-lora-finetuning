Sunday afternoon, we all come here
Marina Barrage, sky so clear
Colorful kites fly up so high
Kids all laugh
Touch the sky
Kites fly high
We let them go
Heart feel alive
Happiness flow
Under sun
Together we find
Simple joy
Peace of mind
Family, friends, share this place
Lay mat down, our own space
Picnic basket, story share
In this moment, nothing compared
Kites fly high, we let them go
Heart feel light, happiness flow
Under sun, together we find
Simple joy, peace of mind
City behind us, fade away
Watch the kites as they sway
Dreams and hopes tied to string
Here and now our hearts sing
Kites fly high, we let them go
Heart feel light, happiness flow
Under sun together we find
Simple joy
Peace of mind
Wind may change, kites may fall
But we stand strong through it all
Hand in hand, we lift them high
In our hearts, together fly
Kites fly high, we let them go
Heart feel light, happiness flow
Under sun, together we find
Simple joy, peace of mind
