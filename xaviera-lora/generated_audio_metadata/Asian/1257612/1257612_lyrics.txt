Walking down this endless road
Under the city's neon glow
Feeling the beat inside my soul
Where this leads nobody knows
Living in a world of dreams
Everything isn't what it seems
Reflections dance in shattered mirrors
Hiding all our silence fears
We are the stars in the midnight sky
Pushing through darkness we learn to fly
Changing the world with our melody
We are the voice of our generation
Can't you see?
In the rhythm of the night
Lost in the music feeling right
Dancing like no one's inside
Embracing the captivating light
We've got a feeling in our hearts
That this is only the start
The night is young let's spark the flame
In this universal game
We are the stars in the midnight sky
Rolling the dice it's our time to fly
Singing our dreams into reality
We are the voice of our generation
Just wait and see
In this city of waking dreams
Nothing is ever as it seems
With the music as our guide
On this incredible ride
Shining like diamonds in the sky
We are K-Pop
And we were born to fly
