Walking in the city lights
Caught between the day and night
Hey there, tell me what's your dream tonight
Dance with stars, let's ignite
In a world of black and white
For a moment, let's redefine
The colors of our life
Nostrils wandering in crowd
Voices whispering aloud
Eyes that speak without a word
In the rhythm we unite
For the love that's in our sight
In this moment let's ignite
The rhythm of our lives
Broken hearts yet we smile, walked alone for a million miles
