In the heart of Seoul under the city's glare
We found a rhythm, a melody so rare
Between us sparks just like a flare
In the days of love nothing can compare
With the beat of Korean pop we ignite
Underneath the neon in the moonlight
Joined by the rhythm, our hearts unite
In this tape our sins, it feels so right
Through the city's poles, dancing free and wild
Into our own world, like a mesmerized child
Our tune resonates, it's not reviled
Since I found you, I've always smiled
The melody of Korean pop, restored
Not bound by gravity anymore
Caught in the music, in fine folklore
In this K-pop dream, it's you I adore
In this melody of soul, we find peace
In this Korean pop, our worries cease
Underneath the skyline as the lights increase
In the K-pop beat, we find our release
Through the city's pulse, dancing free and wild
In a hollow world, like a mesmerized child
Our tune resonates, it's not reviled
Since I found you, I've felt so right
Through the city's pulse, dancing free and wild
In a hollow world, like a mesmerized child
Our tune resonates, it's not revival
Since I found you, I've always knew I adore
