Silent night, city's gone
Lost in thoughts, where to go?
어디로 갈까?
Neon signs, flashing bright
Chasing dreams, day and night
Streets of lies, words deep, chasing shadows cannot see
Tender so off, so upbeat, says words so wild
Words pass by my side, meantime
Miscondition, little condition, flawless sight
눈부신 빛, in the dark my light
내게 빛나는 night, every moment
모든 순간, every sign
모든 진저, we were feeling fine
너와 함께 느끼는
Pick up dreams faded in ink
Seeking truth, what do I think?
Echoes low, whispers high
In your case stars align
Steps uncertain, path unclear
Chasing shadows draw near
(Fly down the line)
Voices of truth unfold
Stories told, moments hold
(Tell me to fear)
Mint Condition
Mint Condition
Mint Condition
Mint Condition
Flawless night
눈부신 빛
In the dark of my life
내게 빛나는 night
Every moment
모든 순간
Every sign
모든 change of wind
I'm feeling fine
너와 함께 느끼는 moonlight
Being social is called love
