Underneath glowing city lights, our hearts aflame
Dancing free into the mystery of the night
One look, one touch and the sparkle of your eyes
In this world of K-pop beats, we soar the skies
Take my hand through the rhythm, let's convey
Beneath the stars of Seoul where dreams stray
In the heart of the rhythm, feeling the electric heat
Where the sync of our hearts and the K-pop beat meets
Immortal moments in the flesh of neon beams
Caught in the rhythm, weaving our dreams
Every melody, every enchanting tune
Carries us through time under the silent moon
With our K-pop sound, let your heart glow
Lose yourself in the melody, let your feelings show
Join me in this dance where love's design
In our K-pop echo, forever intertwined
As the song ends and the city sleeps
In our hearts the K-pop rhythm leaves
In every beat, in every chime
In the melody of soul, we're lost in time
