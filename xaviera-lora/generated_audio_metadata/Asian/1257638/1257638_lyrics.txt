In the city lights, dancing through the night
Feeling so alive under the neon signs
Caught in your eyes, just can't get enough
Lost in the rhythm, feel the music in my blood
It's like a dream, can't feel my feet
When you're here with me, can't beat this beat
Spinning like a cyclone, caught in your undertow
We're floating on the cloud nine, don't wanna let go
Out of sight in the middle of the night
Underneath the stars, hearts take flight
In a world that's ours, just you and I
Beneath the city lights we touch the sky
Can't keep it to myself got this burning desire
Every melody every beat takes us higher
Dancing with the shadows an electric dream
In this moment nothing is quite as it seems
In the ocean of love we dare to dive
Lost in the rhythm feeling so alive
In the starry night under the city lights
We dance to the beat in the heat of the night
In the symphony we find our harmony
In the rhythm, in the beat, in our melody
Under the city lights, no end in sight
Dancing'til the dawn, in the heart of the night
In the ocean of love
