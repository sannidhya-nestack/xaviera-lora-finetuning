In the heart of soul
Beneath the neon glow
We find a melody
Let our feelings flow
Each beat, each rhythm
Tells a tale of its own
In this city of dreams
We have grown
Through the crowded streets, beneath the night sky
Our voices rise in harmony as we let our spirits fly
In this moment of magic under the moon
In music we find our might
In the rhythm of the night
In the melody of the soul
We dance, we dream
In this city bored
Our hearts beating
In unison to the rhythm of the night
In this city of stars under the moonsoft light
Though we may wander far and wide
In the heart of the music, our dreams they reside
Underneath the sparkling skyline, in the need
In the rhythm of soul
We take flight
In the sea of dreams
Beneath the stars gleaming ray
In the heart of the music
We find our way
In the rhythm of soul
Under the moon's gentle sway
We dream, we dance
We lose ourselves in the melody of the day
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
