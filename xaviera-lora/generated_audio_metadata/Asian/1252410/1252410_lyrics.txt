You're my starlight, you shine in the night
Even in the darkest hour you make everything bright
Hold my hand through the storm, we'll be dancing'til dawn
Your love is my remedy and you are from my home
Oh baby your smile's my sun, together we run
In your embrace I find my grace, no need to chase
Our love's not a race, your voice my lullaby
With you I'm always high
We're a beautiful sight
Forever by your side
You're my skylight, you shine in the night
Even in the darkest hour, you make everything right
Hold my hand through the storm, we'll be dancing'til dawn
Your love is my remedy, in you I found my own
Oh baby, your smile's my sun, together we run in your embrace
I find my grace, no need to chase
Our love's not a race
Your voice my lullaby
With you I'm always high
We're a beautiful sight
Forever by your side
You're my sky
You shine in the night
Even in the darkest hour
You make everything right
Hold my hand through the storm
We'll be dancing'til dawn
Your love is my remedy
And you are from my home
Oh, oh, oh
