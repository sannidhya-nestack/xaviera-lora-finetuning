Lost in the rhythm
Lost in the beat
Underneath the neon of a Seoul city street
Life in Technicolor
Everything so bright
Living on a dream in the soft moonlight
When we're dancing, we're shining, breaking free
In the city of dreams where we're meant to be
Caught in the melody, feeling the flow
But this is our K-pop world, just lose control
Every heart beats like a drum
Feeling the rhythm becoming one
Stars flicker in the sky in a dazzling display
This is our K-pop dream, let's dance the night away
We're dreaming, we're gleaming, can't you see?
In the city of love, we're living free
Caught in harmony, feeling the glow
This is our K-Pop world, just let it show
Dance until the dawn
Feeling so alive
In our K-pop heaven
Where only we can thrive
Under the moonlight
With the city in view
This is our K-pop world, me and you
We're dancing, we're shining, breaking free
In the city of dreams where we're meant to be
Caught in the melody, feeling the flow
This is our K-Pop world, just lose control
Me and you
