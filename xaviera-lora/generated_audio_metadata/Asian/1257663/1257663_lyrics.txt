Flickering lights in the city tonight
Our hearts beat as one under the neon lights
In the mirror of your eyes my reflection's so bright
Through the noise your voice is my favorite sight
We're spinning in this K-pop melody
In the rhythm we find our unity
Our hearts echo in enchanting harmony
In this song our unspoken love story
Skylines paint the rushing heartbeat of soul
In this dance, you're the missing piece making me whole
The language of rhythm, the music's powerful control
You touch your words, they fill my soul
We're lost in this sweet K-pop symphony
And every note is encoded our journey
Exchanging smiles amidst the dance frenzy
In your arms is where I always want to be
Our two minutes, K-pop magic, a love unfurling
The song may be short but our emotions overwhelming
In the fading notes, a new story brewing
