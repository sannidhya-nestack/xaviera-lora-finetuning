In the night, stars align
너의 눈빛 like a sign
Whispers of hearts collide
너와 함께 I'll confide
Eyes meet, 너와 나
In this moment, 우리 다시 뛰어나
손을 잡아 take a leap
With you 너와
Will keep still for myself
너만을 위해 no one else
Every breath every sigh
With you no one I will fall
In your arms games unfold
내 맘속 너의 손잡아
Promises made future's told
너와 함 they will never grow old
Eyes locked, 너와 나 in this moment
우리 다시 뛰어나 손을 잡아
Take a leap with you, 너와
Will keep still you for myself
No matter we had no one else
Every breath every sigh with you
No one now will fall
Through the storms through the rain
No one hungered will remain
In your love I find my wealth
I'm not a millionaire
I'll steal you for myself
Through the storms and the rain
No, I won't give it away
In your love I find my wealth
I'm not a millionaire
I'll steal you for myself
Steal you for myself
