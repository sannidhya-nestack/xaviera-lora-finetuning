Clock ticking, but the work's not done
Sunset's wet, I'm still on the run
Burning the midnight oil, chasing dreams
In the silence, my ambitions freeze
Walker hours, heartache bright
Pushing boundaries, expanding the mind
Sacrifices made for the greater power
In the depths of night, I'll find my tower
Paper stacks, deadlines, zooming in near
No time for doubt, no room for fear
Striving for more, reaching for the sky
In the realm of hustle, I'll never say die
Longer hours, harder pride
Pushing boundaries, expanding my mind
Sacrifices made for the greater power
In the depths of night, I'll find my tower
Longer I was hurt, I'd find the tower
And longer I'll love her, so never say die
Longer hours, the past all night I've saved my time
Longer hours, the depths of night I found my tower
Longer hours, harder grind
Pushing boundaries expanding the mind
Sacrifices made for the greater power
In the depths of night I found my tower
I find myself lower
I find myself lower
