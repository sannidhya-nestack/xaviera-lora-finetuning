Flying high we touch the sky
Our dreams they are the light
Feeling fine, we're in our prime
Our hearts beating in time
We're K-Pop, we won't stop
Dancing'til the morning light
We're K-Pop, reach the top
Living every single night
Colors bright under the night
Together we ignite
Friendships bond forever strong
This is where we belong
We're K-Pop, we're non-stop
Dining brighter than the stars
We're K-Pop, at the top
See us sparkle near and far
Moving to the rhythm, feeling the beat
Living for the moment, life's so sweet
We're K-Pop, we won't drop
Dance until we see the light
We're K-Pop, hear the pop
Living every single night
K-Pop, we're on the spot
No matter what, we're never gonna stop
Colors bright under the night
Giving every giving and we're gonna stop
Living every single night
NFL with the more and we're never gonna stop
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Living every single night
NFL with the more and we're never gonna stop
Colors bright under the night
Colors bright under the night
Together we ignite
Friendship's bond forever strong
This is where we belong
We're K-Pop, we're nonstop
Shining brighter than the stars
We're K-Pop, at the top
See us sparkle near and far
Moving to the rhythm, feeling the beat
Living for the moment, life's so sweet
