You're so cute
You're so cute
Another time another place another smile another face
Another room with too much smoke another love becomes a joke
You're so cute
You're so cute
We can't deny the thoughts and such
That brought us here to risk so much
I gave my heart and you'll agree
You gave that same heart back to me
You're so cute
You're so cute
But I can't fathom how that night
Everything felt so right
We can't erase our wandering hearts
And minds that followed it right from the start
You're so cute
You're so cute
I've been around enough to know
When it's love and when it's a show
And so have you, you'll never say
You'd have it any other way
You're so cute
You're so cute
You're so cute
You're so cute
You're so cute
You're so cute
You're so cute
