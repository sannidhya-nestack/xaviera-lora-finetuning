There's a rhythm pounding in my heart
Leads me to you
Let's conquer the night like the city lights do
Our dreams untangle in the neon hue
In a world in chaos I found my peace in you
With the moonlight as our guide, we dance'til dawn
Underneath the stars feels like a dream drawn
The music flows and our hearts follow along
To this K-Pop beat we definitely belong
Through the highs, the lows, and everything in between
With you by my side, I'm living my dream with your love
I feel invincible, powerful enough to reign supreme
In the gatherings one night we'd continue to glow
All of me, I went in the city alone
Winning over trials letting our colors show
To this cave heart where the moon continue to grow, grow
In the gathering twilight, we continue to glow
Our love mirrored in the city below
Winning over trials, letting our colors show
To this K-pop rhythm, we continue to grow
As day turns into the night
It's you I choose
With every beat, every lyric
I have nothing to lose
Forever in this K-pop song
I'll find my muse
With the lights, the music, the love
It's you I'll forever choose
For the highs, the lows, and everything in between
With you by my side, I'm having my dream joined
As the music flows, and our hearts follow along
To this K-Pop beat, we definitely belong
Gigaboolong
We definitely belong
We may continue to grow
