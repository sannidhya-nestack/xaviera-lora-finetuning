And the sig of the neon lights I watch you shouted in twilight
In your eyes I saw my own reflection, a silent connection
Running through busy crowds, under the sky of soul
We listen to the music of life, let the rhythm take control
Rain storms and monochrome
Our colors still shown under the same moonlight
Our souls took flight
The soul city's skyline
Our lives intertwined love advancing, twined
Love advancing like a perfect dance time
The shimmering hot river told tales of a love so pure
The flickering street lights whispered secrets we endure
In pursuit of our dreams across guidelines, puzzling scenes
In this K-pop melody our hearts found serene
In the heart of Korea
We were like a familiar era
Through pain and laughter
We chased after
Tales of cities shining the night
Tales of passion courage and fight
Through every lonely storm
Through every deep reward
As dawn breaks with the morning's grace
We bid farewell in this city's embrace
Though our song ends in song again
In another love story our hearts will ring
