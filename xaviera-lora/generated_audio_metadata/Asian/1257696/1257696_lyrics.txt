Underneath the galaxy stars, we share this moment apart
Feels like our hearts are beating in rhythm
Shining like the northern lights
Words we whisper in the dark, they become the skyline's arc
If you're the city never sleeps
You're the pulse that gives it life
We're dancing on the edge of dreams
Under the neon lights
In a world that's drawn at seams
We're the symphony in the night
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold it tight in your sight
Just promise me you'll stay, everything will be alright
In the sea of monochrome, your color is all I own
With every breath, with every step, I feel your love resonate
Reflections dancing in your eyes like the city skyline's guise
In this tale of love and truth
Our story will culminate
We're dancing on the edge of dreams
Under the neon lights
In a world that's torn at sea
Spread the symphony in the night
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold it tight in your sight
Just promise me you'll stay
Everything will be alright
Tonight in the city of dreams
Let's make our melody
With the rhythm of our hearts
This song will set us free
From the first beat until the end
We'll dance to our symphony
In the story of you and me
Our love will always be
