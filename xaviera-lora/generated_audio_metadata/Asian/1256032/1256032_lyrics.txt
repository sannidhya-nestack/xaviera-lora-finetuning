In this midnight city where the stars don't sleep
And your sparkling eyes hide our soul deep
Between the neon signs are secrets we keep
In our K-pop melody we make the hearts leap
We're still the spotlight as we walk through the crowds
Your laugh is the music breaking all bounds
With the city as our stage and night as the shroud
In this K-Pop serenade love astoundingly resounds
Your whispers are lyrics in the city's hum
Under the street lights we sway to the strum
In our shared dreams a symphony we strum
In our K-pop saga together we succumb
In the dance of shadows, under the city light
Our rhythm binds us, lighting up the night
K-pop ballad, our love and city lights
In this urban lullaby, love ignites
In the silent whispers of the starlight
Our love story continues, it's never gone
In this K-Pop song, we are drawn
Two souls serenading until the break of dawn
In the dust of shadows, under the sandy heights
Under the sad nights, with me
