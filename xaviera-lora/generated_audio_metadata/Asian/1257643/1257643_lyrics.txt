Put a game underneath your lies
Solve the directives in shadows of the night
Feel the rhythm in heart, let's take flight
We're painting the town, not a care in sight
Let loose, feel the beat and hold on tight
In the world of colors we ignite
Feel the music, feel our hearts collide
In this moment we leave world behind
Together dancing, souls intertwined
In time with the cities, where it may be
Underneath the stars on this busy street
And the rhythm of our hearts will repeat
Beyond the skyline, dreams are inside
Let's hold on to this un ettable night
In the city that never sleeps
Where love and dreams run deep
Tonight our memories will keep
On this luminous city street
I've been there, I've done it, it's all fine
Put pain in the town, not a care at its side
Let loose, feel the beat and hold on tight
In the world of love colors we ignite
In the school, in the city streets
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Beings hung at the city's rhythmic beat
Underneath the stars
On this busy street
In the rhythm of night
Feel a pity that never repeats
