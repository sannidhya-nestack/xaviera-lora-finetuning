Walking in the neon skies, in the city alive
Heartbeat sinks with city vibes, feeling the high
Faces pass by in the buzz, each with a tale
In the rhythm of soul, we set the sail
Turn it up, let the music play
In the heart of soul, we sway
To the rhythm, to the beat
In the city that never hits the retreat
Every corner, every street has a rhythm, a beat
In the dance of life, every heart beats at feet
Strangers, smiles, lovers, eyes, no reason told
In the rhythm of soul, we're brave and bold
Turn it up, let the music play
In the heart of soul we sway
To the rhythm, to the beat
In the city that never hits the retreat
Every corner, every street has a rhythm beat
In the dance of life, every heartbeat's a feelin'
Ninja smiles, mother's eyes, stories untold
In the rhythm of soul, we're brave and bold
Turn it up, let the music play
In the heart of soul we sway
To the rhythm, to the beat
In the city that never takes defeat
As the sun sets under the neon lights array
In the heart of soul we dance the night away
