Tell me I'm the city
Brighter than neon lights
Blue yet to be pretty
You're perfect in my sight
Reaches the skyline
Faster than the flight
In this beautiful chaos
On my bright night
A dance and a rhythm
Following the city beat
A reflection in the glass of industry
Just like a K-pop song
A story oh so sweet
In this music of the night
You make me complete
In the arcade of love you were my high score
Every look each touch always leaves me wanting more
You feel like home in a city I adore
With you by my side there's a world to explore
Under the moonlight, we're coloring the town
Skipping in the rhythm of an electric drum
Your presence is the lyric, your smile's my clone
Our love's the best key, I'm making a renowned sound
And in the city of dreams, the love we found
Will echo in every street, every underground
With you my love, my heart beats, the only sound
In our K-pop love story
Forever we are bound
Into the moonlight, we're coloring the town
Skipping in the rhythm now, letting the night to drown
To feel like home in inner city, oh so sweet
This music of the night, you make me complete
And we are bound, the love heat of love, you are my high score
Everyone keeps touch, almost leaves me wanting more
I feel like home in a city all absorbed
You are the night, you make me complete
In the arcade of love you are my high score
Every look each touch always leaves me wanting more
You feel like home in the city I adore
With you by my side
There's a world to explore
Another moment of color in the town
Skipping in the rhythm now in the night to drown
Your presence is the limit your smile's my crown
I love the best K-pop making a renowned sound
In the arcade of love, you are my high score
Every look, each touch always leaves me wanting more
Not letting the night to drown
