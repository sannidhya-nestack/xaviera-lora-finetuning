I bought me an accordion just the other day
I paid $10 ,000 so I could learn to play
I sat right down to play it, it didn't sound so nice
I called up Diccontino to ask him his advice
Oh yeah, oh my goodness
He said, "I know the problem, it sounds like it's brand new
It needs some marinara sauce, I'll pour some in for you"
He played me Tico Tico, it sounded like I should
But when I tried to play it, it didn't sound so good
Oh no
Oh my goodness
I didn't get discouraged
I called up Bard Van Dam
He told me what it needed was a quart of chocolate man
I tried to play a bop tune
And all I got was blues
He said you're on the right track but get rid of those red shoes
Can you imagine an accordion player without red shoes? Uh, no.
I got a third opinion from my friend Gary Siebert
He said to me, "Hey listen, Schlick, here's what you need to do"
He opened up my bellows and when he looked inside he shook his head
And then he said, "Your accordion is fried !" Too bad
There is one thing that you can do, I've seen it done before (where?)
He took a pitcher full of beer and he began to pour (no) and pour (and pour) (oh)
I went to play a polka and all I got was this
A wheezing, squeezing melody that sounded just like this
The indigestion polka, the acid reflex march
There's a burning in my bellows, a regurgitating wall
My rock and roll is roiling, my zydeco is sick
My classical is gassical, my tango is bestock
Uh, no more strudel for me, please
With friends like these accordions, I should have had a clue
The next brand new accordion, I'll know just what to do
I'll open up the bellows before I make the call
I'll pour some Pepto-Bismol in and sit down in the stall
Oh, and wait, oh no, and wait
For the indigestion polka, the acid reflex march
The burning in my bellows, regurgitating waltzes
My rock and roll is roiling, my zydeco is sick
My classical is gassical, my tango is gestuck
I knew it
I know you may not like it
But I am proud to say
I wrote this song with all the pros who taught me how to play
I owe it all to Art Van Damme and Dick Cantino too
And best of all it's Siebert's fault I'm playing again for you
(Aww get in the act) The indigestion polka
The acid reflex march
The burning in my bellows regurgitating waltzes
My rock and roll is roiling, my zydeco is sick
I guess my Pepto-Bismol will have to do the trick
Oh boy, I feel so much better
Bye Pepto-Bismol
