It's show time!
Hey look they're putting up the circus tent
Let's watch
Hey look at this
All the trucks and the wheels and the poles in the field
Everyone around says it's coming to town
Say, look at all this stuff
This must be the show like a long time ago
It's a magical event under a big top ten
We need a whole lot of help from each and every friend
there's a whole lot to do before the show begins
The circus is finally here
It's an old fashioned show with clowns and cannons too
And it's played every place from here to Timbuktu
The circus is finally here
We gotta pull, pull, pull out the cables
Yank, yank, yank on the tent
Roll, roll, roll out the cages
And pound, pound, pound the stakes in
To keep the tent from tumbling down
The big top is just too heavy for eight, nine or even ten men
We need elephants to raise the tent so we can pack the people in
The circus is finally here
We gotta build up the risers and set up all the seats
Lions and tigers and high wire flyers and clowns with funny feet
The circus is finally here
We gotta pull, pull, pull out the cables
Yank, yank, yank on the tin
Roll, roll, roll out the cages
And pound, pound, pound the stakes in
To keep the tin from tumbling down
Now we're just about there
Before folks come in and the fun can begin
Climb way up there
On the top of it all
Careful don't fall
Put the flag in
Now the show can begin
