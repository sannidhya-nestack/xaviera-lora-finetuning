Australians, oh let us rejoice
For we are young and free
With gold and soil and wealth for toil
Our home is God by sea
Our land abounds in nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare
In history's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia Fair
Beneath the radiant Southern Cross
We'll toy with hearts and hands
To make this commonwealth of ours
Renowned above all the lands
For those who come across the seas
With boundless plains to share
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair
