Oh flower of Scotland, when will we see your like again?
That fought and died for
Euibit hill and land
And stood against him
Proud Edward's army
And sent him homeward
To think again
The hills are bare now, and autumn leaves lie thick and still
O land that is lost now, which those so dearly held that stood against him
Proud Edward's army
And sent him homeward to think again
Those days are past now
And in the past they must remain
But we can still rise now
And be the nation again that stood against it
Proud Edward's army
And sent him homeward to think again
