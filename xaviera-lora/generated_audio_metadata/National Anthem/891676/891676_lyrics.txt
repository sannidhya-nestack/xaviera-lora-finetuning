We'll sing a song, a soldier's song
With cheering rows in chorus
As round our blazing fires we throng
The starry heavens soar us
Impatient for the coming fight
And as we wait the morning's light
Here in the silence of the night
We'll chant a soldier's song
Soldiers are we
Whose lives are pledged to Ireland
Some have come from a land beyond the sea
Sworn to be free
No more our ancient silent
Shall shelter the best fought or the slain
Tonight, we man the dub of danger in Erin's coast
A war will meet cannons roar and rifles peel
We'll chant a soldier's song
