Yeah man, you know, it's like sometimes I'm heading towards this bright white light, you know
Yeah man, it's like just calling me
Like heading towards me man
That shit's heavy
Yeah yeah it's like that knee dip experience or whatever they call it man
It's like a bright white light you know
That shit's heavy, man
It's like a bright white light man
Keeps calling you know
When I go to sleep man
I'm like trying to get my head down you know
Turning this way turning that way
That shit's heavy man
Like a bright white light
It's like a bright white light
It's like a bright white light
