Shake it, wake it
Feel the ground, don't fake it
Oh, spin it, burn it
Lose your name, return it
Drums are bleeding, gods are loud
We raise the dirt, we feed the crowd
In swelling color, bones and base
We turn this place to outer space
No control, no plan, no sin
Just the animal deep within
Close your eyes, let thunder crawl
This is how we lose it all
Electric mojo ritual
We burn the night in spiritual
Electric mojo, body and soul
Freak it out, lose control
La la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la, what?
La la la la la la, la la la, la la la, la la, la, la, la
Hands on fire, tongues collide
Faith and fever amplify
Guitar screamin', floors alive
We don't pray, we just survive
Sound like venom, sound like skin
Let the chaos pull you in
Every nerve's a living drum
Every mind a kingdom come
Electric mojo, ritual
We burn the night in spiritual
Electric mojo, body and soul
Freak it out, lose control
Call it madness (madness)
Call it grace (grace)
Feed the thunder (thunder)
Erase the face (face)
We don't end (no end)
We just begin (again)
Electric Mojo, let it in
Electric mojo ritual
Voices rising physical
Noise and faith identical
Electric Mojo Primal Core
