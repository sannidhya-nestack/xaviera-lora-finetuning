Soul is worn, I bleed inside
Deceptions kill, deceptions blind
Selfless thoughts, breach my mind
The more you give, the more you die
The sun is gone and I'm bleeding out
A star is lost and I'm bleeding out
All my friends, all my life
All my love is yours tonight
Tempting fate, tempting spite
As the prey on the darkest night
But I'm not afraid, I see light
Can't reach me now, tonight I die
The sun is gone and I'm bleeding out
A star is lost and I'm bleeding out
All my friends, all my life
All my love is yours tonight
The sun is gone and I'm bleeding out
My star is lost and I'm bleeding out
All my friends, all my life, all my love
The sun is gone and I'm bleeding out
My story's lost and I'm bleeding out
All my friends, all my life
All my love is yours tonight
