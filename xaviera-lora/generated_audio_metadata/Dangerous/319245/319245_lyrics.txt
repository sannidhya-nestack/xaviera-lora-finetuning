In the twilight of her years
All the beauty is starting to fade
Nowhere to escape
And panic is starting to show
She's not much of a mentor
'Cause it's always been about keeping score
Behind the scenes is all that's left to adore
Bitterness is starting to grow
And loneliness is starting to show
What will she do?
Where will she go?
The fear of being invisible
Is too much to bear
The thought of being your own
Paralyzes to the core
The fear of being in the dark
Is too much to bear
The thought of being no one
Paralyzes to the core
Mourning the loss of her youth
Lacking the wisdom to see
She's free to be free from surface reality
Hard to find any sympathy
it's always been about duplicity
Now loneliness is all that's left of her
Knowing she could be so much more
But how it fits is not really sure
In the grand scheme to move on
The fear of being invisible
Is to much a bad
The thought of being no one
Paralyzes to the core
The fear of being invisible
Is too much a bad act
The thought of being no one
Paralyzes to the core
The fear of being invincible is too much a bad
The thought of being no one paralyzes to the core
