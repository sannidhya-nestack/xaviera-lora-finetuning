I love a lock, I love a lock, ah
Don't even think that you'll die
Don't even think that you'll die
Don't even think
You must die, you must die, you must die, you must die (die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
Die, die, die, die, die, die (die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
(laughing)
You must die, you must die, you must die, you must die
You must die, you must die, you must die
(Maniacal Laughter)
(Evil laughter)
