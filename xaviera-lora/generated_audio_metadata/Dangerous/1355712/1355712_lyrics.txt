No rules, no leakage
Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye
The fingers itch for the prize tonight (yeah)
Shadows creep where the lights ignite (night)
Heartbeats pounding like a drum in flight (why me?)
Who's afraid of the dark? Not I
Feel the bass thump deep in your chest
(Yeah, yeah)
808's hit like a lion possessed (yeah, yeah)
Roll the high hats fast, no rest (yeah, yeah)
Shadow stomp, shadow stomp, no contest (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Knuckles crack when the silence speaks (whoo)
Echo scream from the floorboards' creaks (whoo)
Chasing dreams with a jagged streak
No rules, no leash, no peak
It's a dance with the dark dark back
It's a fire with no spark (dark, dark, dark, dark, dark)
It's a dance with the dark (dark, dark, dark, dark)
It's a fire with no spark (spark, spark, spark, spark, yeah)
Feel the bass stomp deep in your chest
It awaits it like a lion possessed (yeah, yeah)
Roll the high hats fast, no rest (yeah, yeah)
Shadow stomp, shadow stomp, no contest (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Every step's a war, every breath's a fight (fight)
Every move's a howl cutting through the night (night, night)
A kingdom built on chaos and spite
Shadow stomp, shadow stomp, take flight
