(audience laughing)
Your shadow crossed my sacred ground
I felt the silence break its sound
A silver flame behind your eyes
It burned the truth, revealed the lies
You spoke my name like ancient sin
And pulled the darkness from within
No mercy left
No light between, I knelt before my blood queen
Your kiss, a curse I can't revoke
A vow sealed in smoke
I drank the pain and lost my sight
Now love becomes the endless night
Blood queens, my heart's your blade
You rule the dreams that never fade
Through crimson tears I call your name
And burn in beauty lost in flame
Blood queens, the crown of scars
You wear the night, you steal the stars
No mortal soul can intervene
I'd die again for my blood queen
The moonlight dances on your skin
A hymn to every deadly sin
You whisper soft, I fade away
A ghost that love refused to stay
Your eyes command, I can't deny
The storm that blooms when angels die
I give my breath, I give my sheen
To rise once more, your blood queen
Your kiss, a curse I can't revoke
A vow sealed in the smoke I drink your fire it feels divine My veins now sing with serpentine
Blood Queens, my heart's your blade
You rule the dreams that never fade
Through crimson tears I call your name
And burn in beauty lost in flame
Blood Queen, the crown of scars
You wear the night, you steal the stars
No mortal soul can intervene
I die again for my black queen
In your arms, the daylight falls
The heavens echo empty calls
No god can break the spell I've seen
The endless reign of the Blood Queen
Blood Queen
My fate, my fire
You feed the dark, my one desire
Your crimson lips, my sacred sin
Let night begin, let night begin
Blood Queen
The eternal reign
Your love's a wound I crave again
No mercy left, no in between
I live and die for my blood, why?
My heart still bleeds for you
