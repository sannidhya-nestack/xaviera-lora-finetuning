They invade, our hopes are invade
They invade, our hopes are invade
I'm going to go to bed now. Good night, and have a good night.
Go far, go far and go far, go far, go far, go far and go far
Do you think I can't resist? It's so somber alone without you
Vain, in vain
All hopes are in vain
Vain, in vain
All hopes are in vain
They invade, our hopes are in vain
They invade, our hopes are in vain
