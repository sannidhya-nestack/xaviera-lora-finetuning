I'm not taking life for granted, if I did I would be a fool
But I'm getting almost anything that I set my mind to
I'm standing in the front line baby, where all of the action is
I spit into the eyes of danger and going with all the changes
Ain't nothing worth it really, just follow after me
I took it step by step and then I found they like my music
You have to keep on trying whatever's on your mind
They take us where they want but basically they like my music
I'm heading on a ship out to sea sailing across the border
Weathering what comes my way but I can't walk on water
I've played every game I could think of
And somehow managing always to win
And when it comes time to stand up and fight
You can always count me in
I stand up in a crowd
I'm speaking kinda loud
And though some people still might disagree
They like my music
I could've been a lawyer
Or maybe a destroyer
But this is what I choose to be
They like my music
