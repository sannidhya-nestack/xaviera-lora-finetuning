I've been down many roads
Mostly in the dead of night
You never know what you're gonna see
That just might change your life
Oh, to surprise me
To surprise me
Would be a surprise
Surprise me
Would be a surprise
Many years I lived underground
I've danced on the darker side
Got a call from the devil for a deal
But we could not agree on price, oh
To surprise me
To surprise me
Would be a surprise
To surprise me
Would be a surprise
Would be a surprise
It could be a surprise
Could be a surprise
