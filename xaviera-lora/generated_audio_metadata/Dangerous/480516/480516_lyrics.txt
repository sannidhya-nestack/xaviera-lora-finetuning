I was going like a lover when the secrets died
Only live for today and I choose to abide
Drinking life's perfume like it was wine
If wine is your passion, the gentry is mine
Shrouded by the rose and opium smoke
There's a vodka that's about to die
To evoke all the enemies with their intellects
Velvet limbs with no wristband
You have been blinded, death haunts your dreams (stare into the light)
Charlie, don't just waste the gold of your days now
The meaning of love, or at least the trivial side
Is seen by those souls with nothing to hide
Faithless scandal and poisonous deed
Are taken by souls that tragedy bleeds
Surrounded by the rose and ivory clothes
There's a feeling of sin that's about to provoke
Such triumph in love with a meaningless sex
Self-advice is a sin with romantic years
You gotta live like death on your dreams
Such love, surely you don't just waste the gold of your days now
The colors of love are with the colors of strife
Bleed out the canvas and into my light
Those who hate will never be free
There's no love in our hands, too dead to see
