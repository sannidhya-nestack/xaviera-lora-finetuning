There's a killer in the corner and she won't let me be
Making eyes in disguise while she's smiling at me
There's a killer in the corner but you must understand
I'm hypnotized, paralyzed by her sleight of hand
(I'm not afraid)
I'm hypnotized, paralyzed by her sleight of hand
There's a killer in the corner and she won't let me be
Making eyes in disguise while she's smiling at me
There's a killer in the corner but you must understand
I'm hypnotized, paralyzed by her sleight of hand
There's a killer in the corner and she won't let me be
Making eyes in disguise while she's smiling at me
There's a killer in the corner but you must understand
I'm hypnotized, paralyzed by her sleight of hand
I'm hypnotized, paralyzed by her sleight of hand
Wow!
