The shadows are where I find
The meaning I've left behind
They whisper to my mind
Keep searching, duh-duh-duh
The border between night and day
Shows me a different way
I always hear it say
Keep searching till you find your dream
Night time is mystery
Night time's romance
Walk where the glow of neon is low and danger tingles
Dispel all the madness
Relinquish the fear
Listen to your heart keep saying
The shadows are where you'll find
The meaning you'll leave behind
They'll whisper to your mind
Keep searching
