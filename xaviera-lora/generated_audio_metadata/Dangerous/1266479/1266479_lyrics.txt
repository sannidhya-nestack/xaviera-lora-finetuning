I killed Bonnie, I killed Lou
I killed Ed and I killed Sue
I killed Mo, I killed Bob
I killed his cat, I killed his dog
I killed Bo, I killed Sam
I watched him squeal like a lamb
I strangled him with a wire
And I set his whole damn house on fire
I killed Mo, I killed Brad
I stole his dough and killed his dad
I killed Ned, I killed Ted
And I think I did kill Fred
I killed Kim, I killed Jack
I killed Jim and I killed Zack
I killed Dawn, I killed John
And I killed him just for fun
I killed Bert, I killed Lily
I killed Kurt and I killed Billy
I killed Ken, I killed Phil
I killed Ben and I killed Jill
I killed Don, I killed Rick
I killed Ron and I killed Vic
I killed a guy named Sly
And I can't remember why
Yes, your honor
I do confess, but I think I ot to mention
Joe and Tess, I am the one who killed them all
Including Mark and Willie, Stan, Dan and Paul
