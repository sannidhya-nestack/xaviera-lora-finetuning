Yes, yes, my intellect moves, who's beside me now?
I found myself a belt, a mask and cloud of room
The television is what leaves me
Ooh, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'll lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie, I'l lie,
(Ohhh)
Collecting, inheriting these times for real
(Ohhh)
Under the rose climbed the zephyr
Turning clockwise that ring spread
Buddha's embrace and the skin I tattooed
Gathered in the street of the roof of the moon
Now that her staff didn't lose feel
Felt team with grounds of abstract ordeal
I'm a Nile
I'll find my isle
Might this be the carriage in my time for sleep
Black Jim Lee inherited these rhymes real slow
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Forever
