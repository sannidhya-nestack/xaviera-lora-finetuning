Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Who will always love?
(I am the light of the world)
We're calling to you from afar
The closer you get to our shore
Will mean the end of your time
Hear our voices calling to you
Come a little closer, meet our kiss
Don't wait, we'll make you meet your fate
Here the rocks are singing to you
No one step closer, don't feel it
We're coming to you from afar
The closer you get to our shore
Will mean the end of your time
Hear our voices calling to you
Come a little closer, need our kiss
Don't wait, we'll make you meet your fate
Hear the rocks are singing to you
You're one step closer
Don't be late
Tie yourself with your voice
Plug your ears for your fear
'Cause if you need all the sweetness
You'll certainly need some care
Tie yourself to the ship, boys
Love your ears so you'll dare
(Hey, my party of boys)
Tie yourself to the ship, boys
Love your ears so you'll dare
As a beauty and a sweetness, you'll certainly miss your death
Tie yourself to the suit of voice, love your insignia
Yon-ra-za-ya-yi-zu-ri-ya-ya-u-ri-li-ya-de-ya
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
