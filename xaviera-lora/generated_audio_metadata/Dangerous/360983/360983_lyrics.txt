Get me out of the ghost of this
Like a bullet through the head
I feel okay, I feel okay
Just my head turns away
Move in
I was only a killer
(Get me out of this place)
I feel okay, I feel okay
Just my head turns away
Move in
I'm lonely again now
Get me out of the ghost of this suffering
I feel the pain, I feel the weight of my life on the ground
