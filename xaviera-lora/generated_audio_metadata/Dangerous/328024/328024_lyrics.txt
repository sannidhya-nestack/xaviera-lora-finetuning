Are you on that computer again?
Get off of that thing
Why don't you go outside and play with your friends?
Get away from that thing
And go do something constructive
Teenage born and children too
Making bombs in your bathroom
Free iPods and computer ink
Hook up meth in the kitchen sink
Techniques from Smith and gasoline
How to put food without being seen
Catch yourself and hide the scars
Buy and deal with fake ID cards
Clicks and words are the seeds
In search is the water you need
Clothes are cropped even you can dream
I've got it available on your computer screen
I've got it
And I'll leave a little computer screen
Suicide packs and murder trials
Buy any drug you desire
Find the data on the computer scene
No harm done, it's all free
Chat in a room, tellin' lies
Take a trip on a virtual high
Lose some cash, Vegas style
Escaped from life for a little while
Clicks and words are the seeds
It will search the water you need
Grows a crop even you can dream
A garden of evil your computer screen
A garden of evil your computer screen
It's free speech, that's good I guess
Some stuff's okay, some's a mess
We need to clean it up, I know that's true
Soon your kids'll be surfing too
(Licks and words are the seeds)
(If it was such is the war you need)
(Rose of crop even you can dream)
(A gun and a view of your computer screen)
(A gun and a view of your computer screen, yeah)
Blicks of words are the seeds
It searches the water you need
Bows across even you can dream
A god in a view of your computer screen
A god in a view of your computer screen
