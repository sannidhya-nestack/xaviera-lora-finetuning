All the visions in my mind are inside of heaven's armory
The sense of trust is no excuse
This is just a dream that I have been pursuing with a little hope to come true
I don't know what else to say but I have to go
(I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the light)
I've got a lot to say, but I'm gonna do what I need to do to get out of here
I'm sorry if I'm not a good person to you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
