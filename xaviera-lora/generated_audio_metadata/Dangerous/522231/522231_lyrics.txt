We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time
As the system awakes it takes into my mind
A pill to side to my fate
Is this really alive or shall I look outside
And take back what's mine
I see the demons inside your eyes
I see the demons inside your mind
Can you let them grow inside
Light a soul, is this really a song
As it shadows my sight
Everyone looking down at me
As I'm tearing up my life
I hear the guns firing down
I see the sight of your frown
I see the lights of desire
I see the lights of desire
I see the lights of desire
I see the lights of desire
How you feel it, do you feel it too?
