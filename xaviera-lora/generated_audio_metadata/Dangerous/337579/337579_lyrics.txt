For you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So I live it
Oh, so beautiful you are
Half a year goes by without us
Got this bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling, bad feeling
I know it's sick, I know it's sick, you see? I know it's sick, I realize I'm sick, you know?
Breathe me in
Hold me close
I need you
How you want something
For you, oh, so I live in rest
