A quiet city street
People afraid to meet
The victims rarely seen
What could it all mean
With love on her face
The mother holds his hand
The pastor stands in place
The son is lost to grace
For since he has no care, but mother strokes his hair
His eyes are filled with hate, he's sealed his fate
It's getting late, hell is in wait
Closed goes the gate
Where do we go from here?
What happened to our cheer?
Our hometown boy is gone
Where did he go wrong?
When times are hard and long
We try to do our best
For our family's needs
Will fall upon our knees
When sanctity and pride are lost
Our lives are the cost
When sanctity and pride are lost
Our lives are the cost
It's getting late
Hell is in wait
Close goes the gate
He's sealed his fate
It's getting late
Hell is in wait
Close goes the gate
Close goes the gate
The so-called human race
We're lost without a trace
Damnation's state of mind
Has made us all go blind
When sanctity and primord lost
Our lives are the cost
When sanctity and prayer are lost
Our lives are the cost
It's getting late
Hell is in wait
Lost goes the gate
He sealed his fate
It's getting late
Hell is in wait
Close goes the gate
Close goes the gate
When sanctity and breath are lost, our lives are the cost
When sanctity and breath are lost, our lives are the cost
Our lives are the cost
Our lives are the cost
Our lives are the cost of fear
