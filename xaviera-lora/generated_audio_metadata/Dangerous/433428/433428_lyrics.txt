Feast on me, you know that you're ready
Come on dear, dinner is served
Ding ding ding
I'm yours for the taking
Yeah
To be somewhere
I am there
Yeah
You love my suicide
Your love's like suicide
Based on me
And I know that you're living
Come on dear
Dinner is suicide
Ding ding ding
I'm yours for the taking
Yeah
Feel love like suicide
You'll love my suicide
You'll love my suicide
Feel love like suicide
Feel love like suicide
Your love's like suicide
Your love's like suicide
Your love's like suicide
You lose my suicide
You lose my suicide
