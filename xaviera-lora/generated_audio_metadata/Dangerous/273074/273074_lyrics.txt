You will only know me when it's time to go
My beloved, you've never met me
Not apart from fleeting moments of intuition
Yet through your choices, your experiences and your fears
And determination, your aspirations
It's you who has shaped me and made me what I am
I know you well, sometimes through filters of nostalgia
And sometimes with painful clarity
I know everything you will go through, every choice you'll make
Every hurdle you will stumble across
And every triumph you will celebrate
I know the true triumphs
Though they will seem dark to you with no way forward
I know which events will pose as moments of delirious joy
But prove to be the paths to disillusionment
I know what informs your choices
I see through your justifications
Sometimes I make harsh judgements upon you
And curse you for your lack of insight
Do you feel my wrath?
Perhaps a part of you does
Then there are times when I want nothing more
Than to embrace you, hold you close to me
And whisper consolation and encouragement to your fragile soul
You will never meet me
You will always wonder who and what I am
Fear for my predicament and expect great things of me
That after all is what drives you
I will constantly call to you
Try to warn you though it seems too late
Chastise you though you will not listen
And comfort you, though you will not feel it
I will see you in photographs
And laugh or cringe
Talk of you to others
Hear others talk of you to me
And remember the words you have spoken to others.
As time dictates, you will only know me when it is time to go.
You will only know me when it's time to go
You will only know me when it's time to go
You will only know me
When it's time to go
