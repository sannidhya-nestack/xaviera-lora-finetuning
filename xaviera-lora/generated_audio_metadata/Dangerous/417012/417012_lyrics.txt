Surrender, surrender, surrender, Dorothy
Surrender, surrender, surrender, Dorothy
For you can't go home again
Surrender, surrender
Surrender to the beat
We'll give you diamonds to take away your tears
You'll be rewarded with sunshine on your ear
But you can't go home again
Surrender, surrender, surrender, darling
Bright like the day today or tomorrow
Sweet like the music in the sun
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender
For you can't go on again
Surrender, surrender, surrender, Laura, leave me now
I'm not alone, not at all
We'll make it through the summer
I never meant to be alone, alone
Sweet girl, you're there in my heart all the time
La, la, la, la, la, la, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Sweet body swaying in the summer sun
