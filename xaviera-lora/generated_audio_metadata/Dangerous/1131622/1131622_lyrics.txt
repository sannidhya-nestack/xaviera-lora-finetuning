Gotta work, gotta work, gotta work, work, work, work

I was young (I was young)
But now I'm old (now I'm old)
And I did (and I did)
What I was told (what I was told)
I was strong (I was strong)
And now I'm weak (now I'm weak)
But I did what I did
For the booze and the meat
I gotta work all day
Of a hoe
Gotta work all night
Gotta work for my pay
Gotta work till I die
Gotta work
Gotta work
Gotta work
