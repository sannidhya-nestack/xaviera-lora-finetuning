The jungle whispers tales untold
Secrets buried deep in folds
A drumbeat sways the endless trees
Calling spirits on the breeze
Echoes rise through the heavy air
Chants awaken stripped and bare
Ancient rivers carve the stone
In their rhythm we're not alone
The eight winged cries a tale forlorn
Leaves like feathers at the morn
Footsteps dance in mossy shade
To a song the ancients made
Echoes rise through the heavy air
Chants awake in stripped and bare
Ancient rivers carve the stone
In their rhythm we're not alone
A fire flickers in the eyes of night
Shadows twist in the pale moonlight
Drums call hearts to join the sea
Of a timeless pulse infinity
Echoes rise through the heavy air
Chants awake and stripped and bare
Ancient rivers carved with stone
In their rhythm we're not alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm vulnerable
I'm vulnerable
