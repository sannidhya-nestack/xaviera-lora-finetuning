She's a star, she has her name in lights
Living in the tights, by her poolside mansion
While I'm alone, just sat here by the phone
I wait until she's home, to call to leave her crying
It's in my head you see
This fantasy of you and me
I have to make you my life
You are my only sweet
Now I'm here swimming in your tears
There's no place to hide
I am deep inside you
Just when you think you're safe
In a darkened place you'll see my face
I have to make you my life
You are my only sweet vice
Just show me how you can cry
I'll have you
Or you will die
Are you mine
Are you mine
So now we're one, just where we belong
In my darkest dream, love's a stranger crying
It's down in history, your love for me will never be
I have to make you my life
I have to make you my life
You are my only sweet vice
Just show me how you can cry
I'll have you or you will die
Are you mad?
Are you mine, are you mine, are you mine
