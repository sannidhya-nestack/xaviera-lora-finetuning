Encloded, my brain's corroded
Too much pollution in my mind
Confusion, there's no solution
To the problems that I find
Pressure, growing pressure
Won't you help me?
Read the signs, why have you gone mad?
Crying, screaming, sad
Help me, won't you help me
I'm hearing voices all the time
Possession in my regression
It's eating through me in desperate times
All the people you've ever loved
The beauty in the sky and the stars above look the same
When they ask you why
Why have you gone mad
Crying, screaming, sad
All that I need is the sound of your voice
Into me
Just look into me
Just look into me
Just look into me
You never told me, I can't help you
This is all too much, hear me
How much longer can you tell me?
Please help me, please help me, call at me
Don't do it, no one can
Into me you cry in my mind now
No more
Why have you gone?
Why have you gone?
Bad, bad, bad, bad
