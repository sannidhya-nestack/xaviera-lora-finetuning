You know you can't keep me here
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
You're not the only thing that's wrong with me
Must be, must be, must be, must be, must be
Must be, must be, must be, must be, must be
Must be, must be, must be, must be, must be
You are the only one I see
I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want to let you go, I don't want
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see (let's see, let's see, let's see)
