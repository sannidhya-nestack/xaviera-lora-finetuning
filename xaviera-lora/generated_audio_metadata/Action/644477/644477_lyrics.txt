Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

Noo, I don't know why I laugh
Hey
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
To the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind, to the wind
So, so, so, so, so, so, so I could go on
