Love
I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the light
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
You can do anything you want, anything, anything
I'm the moon and you're the stars
I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark
Te ge et rohaf a yeme, ay re-e-e-e-e-e-e
Te ge et rohaf a yeme, te ge et rohaf a yeme
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
