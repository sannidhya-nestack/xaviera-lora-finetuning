The world we feel
There's someone watching us
The roulette wheel
What has fate in store for us
When you're thinking and your eyes glaze over
Someone's talking and the words are nowhere
Life is
But I dreamed and said
Life is the part in a movie play
You feel alone in a crowded room today
The search for love and comfort
Just never fades away
When you're walking in the rain and thunder
When the hell is never time you wonder
Life is but a dream they say
Life is a part in a movie play
You want to believe that somebody's there for you
But you cannot decide
Is this the life for us?
Is this the life for us?
And the world it still turns
The fires will burn
When will we learn?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Life is but a dream they say, yeah
Life is a part in a movie play, yeah
Life is (you have to believe)
Life is (you cannot conceive)
Life is (until you've made it with someone you need)
Life is (which way you turn, how much you love)
Life is, life is
