I'm the only one.
I'm the only one.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No need to calm down
Reaching out in silence
Only gonna do you more harm
Craving for some violence
Look around
There's nobody who dares to take this place apart
End of the motherfucking rage
(Growling)
But I know that
I will be free when I'm old
And when I'm six
When I'm fifty
Take another look at my face
And you'll see that we could still be on our way
I think it's better to burn into phrases
Fuck system, fuck science
I go to the moon and I made it from dust
Fuck system, the whole world is at us
But you are tired
I run the emptiness turning surprises
You are nothing
I think it's better to burn enterprises
Fuck system, fuck sizes
You're not moving
I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
You're moving to another space
You're moving to another space, to another space, to another space
No need to calm down, reaching out in silence
Only gonna do you more harm, craving for some violence
Look around, there's nobody who dares to set this place apart
And out of their motherfucking range!
Faster
Don't overthink it
Don't overthink, you're ready
Instant replay
Instant replay
I think it's better to burn into crisis
For existence
I go to the moon and I made it fantastic
Foxy Tom, the only sadness
You are a tire
I ruin the emptiness turning surprises
You are nothing, stop crying
I think it's better to burn into prices
Fuck sizes
