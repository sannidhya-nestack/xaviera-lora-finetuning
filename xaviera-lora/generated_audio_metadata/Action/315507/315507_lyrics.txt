Once thought to rule for all time
Now set to fall like dominoes
Once thought to rule for all time
Now set to fall like dominoes
Once thought to rule for all time
Now set to fall like dominoes
Oh, oh, oh
Once thought to rule for all time
Now set to fall like dominoes
Once thought to rule for all time
Now set to fall like dominoes
Once thought to do it for all time
Now set to fall like diamonds
Once thought to do it for all time
Now set to fall like diamonds
Once thought to do it for all time
Tell her safe to fall like guns in walls
I'm all in.
