The odds are against us, they like to make a fuss
Not buying this negative tea
Noise growing loud, misguided hungry crowd
Propaganda born out of jealousy
But when spirit saw my friends and take their flight
Until the end with all our might
We'll fight, fight, fight
We will triumph, we will be victorious (Victorious)
Wouldn't have it any other way
No other word can be heard victorious (Victorious)
Forever remembering this day
Here we will make a stand
Finally they'll understand
Passion and ferocity
What do they really know
Keep them guessing, let them make a show
The future is ours, our destiny
Let's win spirits
So all my friends and take their flight
Until the end with all our might
We'll fight, fight, fight
We will triumph, we will be victorious (victorious)
Wouldn't have it any other way
No other word can be heard victorious (victorious)
Forever remembering this day
We will triumph, we will be victorious (Victorious)
Wouldn't have it any other way
No other word can be heard
Victorious (Victorious)
Forever remembering this day
Forever remembering victorious (victorious)
Forever remembering victorious (victorious)
Forever remembering victorious (victorious)
Forever remembering this day
