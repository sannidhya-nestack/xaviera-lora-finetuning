When the wind is wild with shouting
And the waves mount ever higher
Anxious eyes turn
Ever see world
To see us home, boys
To mingulate
Oh hail your home, boys
And let her go, boys
Oh bring her back
And all together
Oh hail your old boys
And let her go boys
Say behold
To Zamingha-lei
[Silence]
Heal your whole voice
And let her go boys
Oh bring your head round
And all together
Oh heal your whole voice
Unlet her go boys
Sailing home to Mingulay
Oh, sailing home to Mingulay
Oh, sailing home to Mingulay
Hail Yahweh, oh voice
Hail Yahweh, oh voice
Hail Yahweh, oh voice
