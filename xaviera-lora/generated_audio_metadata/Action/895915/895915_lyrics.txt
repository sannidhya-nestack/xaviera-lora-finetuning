It's the question of all time, never answered
But still we try for understanding
Are we alone? Just live your life now
And never know
Burning through me
Nature's fire
Evolution
World's desire
Why have we come so far
With so much left to learn
We are our children's eyes forever now
Desperate in our domain
Instinct will prevail
The reasons why we're here
No clearer future here
Aging as we turn the pages
Lightly stumble through the ages
Why have we come so far
With so much left to learn
We are our children's eyes forever now
Steal into me a world you'll never see
Just open your mind and you'll find
Tell me
Tell me
What's the answer?
What's the answer?
What's the answer?
What's the answer?
Why?
Have we come so far
With so much left to learn
We are our children's eyes
Forever now
Why have we come so far
With so much left to learn
We are our children's eyes
Forever now
