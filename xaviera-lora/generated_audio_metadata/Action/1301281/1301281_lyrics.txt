We can be heroes
We can save everyone
This is where dreams go
Stars shine for everyone
This is where smiles grow
Angels sing as one
We can be heroes
We have saved everyone
When I last saw you, you said
When I last breathed you, you told me I could not save anyone
We can be heroes, we have saved everyone
This is where dreams go
Stars shine for everyone
This is where smiles go
Angels sing as one
When I last saw you
You said I was done
When I last breathed you
You told me I could not
Be anyone now, I'm up with the skies and voices
In my mind a void has broken
Now I'm one
With the wills of people
For you can't stop our joys and heroes tonight
Is life really your choice and dangers?
When we sing our minds are equal
Trees are made from stolen people
For you can't stop our choice and heroes tonight
We can be heroes
We can save everyone
This is where dreams go
Stars shine for everyone
We can be heroes
We can save everyone
This is where dreams go
This is where smiles glow
Angels sing as one
We can be heroes
We have saved everyone
We can be heroes
We can save everyone
This is where dreams go
Stars shine for everyone
This is where smiles go
Angels sing as one
We can be heroes
We have saved everyone
