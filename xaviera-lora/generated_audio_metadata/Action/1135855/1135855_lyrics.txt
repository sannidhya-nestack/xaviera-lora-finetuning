No adult can see, he loves you visibly
Ever closer as you run out of breath
At midnight hour, from his keen-shaved tower
He comes for you dead
(howling)
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d) (D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d) (D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d) (D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d) (Demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons, demons)
I'll ask myself, how did I get here?
I'll ask myself, how did I get here?
Miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles
In return for all that's true
You know, you can't be sure how and how
You thought in the morning
There's a short-circuiting down the edge of the car
I mean, just walk up your window
And don't think of doing a thing
I'm just a human in this car
And leave the function to continue until you have the beautiful you
Hi everybody
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-b)

Dream about my dream
Dream about my dream
You have to take it easy
Try or you will not succeed
I've been waiting for the love, I've been waiting for the love, I've missed it all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Don't you ever look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back, look back
Don't you ever look back, look back, look back for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love, for the love
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You can't buy the stuff that I'm buying for you, can you?
Hides myself, ah-ha!
Hides myself, ah-ha!
You're a corpse, you're a corpse
You're a corpse, you're a corpse
[MUSIC PLAYING]
And reach out for this too
Even how you can't reach out, and how you get in the middle of them
Or does it show that anything has become?
I would just want apparently a blunt and clear crystal
I want this too anyway, do what you can now
Believe it comes from up there, continually
