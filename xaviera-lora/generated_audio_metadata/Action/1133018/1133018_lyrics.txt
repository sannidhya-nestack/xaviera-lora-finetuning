It feels like I just can't win
Around and around we go
I gave you everything but it wasn't enough
How did we get so far from where we are?
Have we lost control? Will we ever know?
Woah, woah
It feels like I just can't win
I gave you everything but it wasn't enough
Close but yet so far away, away
Know who you love
Just remember to breathe, breathe
Whoa, whoa
I gave you everything but it wasn't enough
How did we get so far from where we are
Have we lost control, will we ever know
Like the way that you move, I just wanna be free
Spitting in circles, trapped in the cycle again
I know, I know, I know
Spitting in circles, trapped in the cycle again
Woah, woah
It feels like I just can't win
It feels like I just can't win
