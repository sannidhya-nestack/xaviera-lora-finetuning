There's a battery, there's a battery, there's a battery
The people that I love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Yes, yes, yes, yes
I watch you from the shadows
House
I hate all the people who are victims of my lies
There's betteries, there's betteries, there's betteries
(There's batteries in your mattress)
