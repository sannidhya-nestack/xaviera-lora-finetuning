No one can see through me
No emotions will I show
I'm living for myself
In a world that no one knows
I've been here for a very long time
Have I lost my way?
I was hurt
And it closed me inside
Would you help me escape myself
ive me, I tried to explain
The way I feel inside
So scared of what you'd think
If the pain destroyed my pride
If you'd please spend a little time
I could open to you, share a thought
A gentle whisper if you could only see
Pass my heart
There's still a man inside, I know
He cries to you
In the silence of his mind
Love and war
He can't decide who wins the fight
If you believe in me
I'll show you worlds beyond your sight
So come to me
And share my life
I will build a love inside
If you'd awaken me
This is the place where I have lived
Since I was broken hearted
It left me cold, so locked inside
But now you're here for me
I know you'll pass my hate
There's still a man inside, I know
He cries to you
In the silence of his mind, as my eyes
There's still a man, there's still a man, there's still a man inside I know
Still a man, yeah
That's still a man, yeah
