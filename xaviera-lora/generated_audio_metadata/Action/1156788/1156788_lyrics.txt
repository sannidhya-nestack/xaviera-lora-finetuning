I realize our potential
I realize our potential
I was a boy and got good
And I know that you must die
Or die like a beast
You still live in this world
Kill all the dead
And save all that's left of you
Oh don't kill me
Oh don't kill me
Oh don't kill me
I don't give a damn
I don't believe, I don't believe, I don't believe, I don't believe
I don't need me, I don't need me
