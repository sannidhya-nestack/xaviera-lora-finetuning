There's tension in the air, I can feel it
There's raging storms inside my bones
There's no turning back from this conflict
I'm ready, and I'm willing to go
This is my battle cry
This is my battle cry
Hey, mama I'm sorry
Rise and fight
Rise and fight
Bronson, Bronson, Bronson fight, Bronson fight, Bronson
Rise and fight
Get ready for the damage
Prepare for defeat
Cause you never faced anyone as ready as me
I was made for this
Trained for this
Don't back down
Gonna stand up, stand up
Hold my ground
I don't surrender
I'm bringing everything
I got em on fire
Yeah I'm coming in hot
I only got one speed
And it's full tilt
Consider this your warning
Cause I shoot to kill
Roshin fight, Roshin fight
Roshin, Roshin, Roshin fight
Roshin fight, Roshin, Roshin fight
