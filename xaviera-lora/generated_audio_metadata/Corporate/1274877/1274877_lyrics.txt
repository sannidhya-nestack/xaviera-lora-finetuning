Yo yo yo, we'bout to blast off
Strapping tight, no turning back, nah
Lift up, we're headed to the top, never drop
Rocket fuel in the tank, we can't stop, nah
Speeding past the haters, leave'em all in shock
Lift off, lift off,'bout to break the lock
See'em seeing music came from the ground
But we climb like a beast
The limits on the hustle I'm unleashed in the streets
Throwing through the barriers the chains get deceased
Where the pressure and the power hold me at the increase
Energy kinetic going straight through the roof
Ain't no slowing down when you step into the booth
Heavy on the grind man I speak the raw truth
In this game too long yeah I got the proof
Hands on the throttle I'm pushing it to a max
Never hold back never cutting no slack
Eyes on the prize stay sharp stay intact
It's a rocket life now ain't no looking back
Lift off or hit it to the top, never drop
Bucket fuel in the tank, we can't stop, nah
Speed up, that's the haters, leave'em all in shock
Lift off, lift off,'bout to break the lock
DMC music is in hardcore mode
Everything's in overdrive
We taking over lanes like a rocket in a ride
Look me in the eye, you can see the fire alive
Ain't no doubts in my mind, I'm built to survive
I ain't come this far just to fade away
I'm a trucker not moving get up out the way
Lifting off from the blocks how we ever on the day
While the fakes on the sidelines watching me play
Skies not the limit I'm shooting past the moon
Enclosing all the weak when I come up soon
Banging on the stars while they hum my tune
I'm in this fast lane living I ain't leaving no room
From the ground up, I built it from scratch
Now we lightin' flames, ain't no holdin' back
Power through the clouds, my rocket's intact
Lift off time, no cap, that's a fact
Lift off, we're headed to the top, never drop
Rocket fuel in the tank, we can't stop, nah
Speedin' past the haters, leave'em on the shop
Lift off, lift off,'bout to break the lock
Blastin' through the stratosphere, we ain't comin' down
From the streets to the stars, we own this crowd
Lift off, lift off, TMC is outta bounds
The takeover is here, yo, pass it around
