I came out right on day
I came out right on day
I can't move, but I can't stay
Going to the places that I love
Under a blue devon sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
And every time I leave
A part of me stays here
Again a brighter day
And you know it feels so good
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea
Out in sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in sunshine
Is it living by the sea
Under a blue sky
Under a blue and white sky
I can't know a brighter day
Than on my feet
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
