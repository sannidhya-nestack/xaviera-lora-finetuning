(I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark)
(I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark)
If knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up, knees up
But I'm a dog, but I'm a dog, but I'm a dog
He's not a robot, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
