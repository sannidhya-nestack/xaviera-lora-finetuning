In the stillness of the night when the stars ignite
I close my eyes and dream away
To a world where I'll find my way
With every beat of my heart
I'm reaching for the stars
I'll never let go
I'll never give up
This dream's who we are
We're chasing after dreams
With fire in our eyes
We'll climb the highest mountains
Underneath the endless skies
We'll never lose sight
Of what we're meant to be
In the pursuit of success
Set our spirits free
Through the ups and downs we face
In this human race
We'll stumble and we'll fall
But we'll rise above it all
With every step we take
We'll learn from our mistakes
We'll keep pushing forward
No matter what it takes
We're chasing after dreams
With fire in our eyes
We'll climb the highest mountains
Underneath the endless skies
We'll never lose sight
Of what we're meant to be
In the pursuit of success
Set our spirits free
There's a fire burning deep inside
Guiding us through the darkest night
We'll follow where it leads
And make our dreams reality
We're chasing after dreams
With fire in our eyes
We'll climb the highest mountains
Underneath the endless skies
We'll never lose sight
Of what we're meant to be
In the pursuit of success to set the spirits free
There's a fire burning deep inside
Guiding us through the darkness night
We'll follow where it leads
And make our dreams reality
We'll chase it after dreams
We're far in our eyes
We'll climb the highest mountains
Underneath the endless skies
We'll never lose sight
Of what we're meant to be
In the pursuit of success, success, be
We'll never lose sight of what we're meant to be
In the pursuit of sight, sight
