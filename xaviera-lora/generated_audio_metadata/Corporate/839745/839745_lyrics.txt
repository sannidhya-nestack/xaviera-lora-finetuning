Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don’t you wanna be free
It’s right, leave us all behind
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free?
I'm going out of my mind
Wake me up when I can't go outside
I spent so long here
I don't know if I
I'm going out of my mind
You lock me up I can't break out of here
One day they'll find me
I don't know if I can see the light
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free, free, free
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
I'm going out of my mind
