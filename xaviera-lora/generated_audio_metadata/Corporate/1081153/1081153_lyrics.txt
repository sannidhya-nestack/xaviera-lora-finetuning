Keep it moving today
I can't wait for you today
Let the time go by
I can't stop the time flow
Burning my heart again
I can never know
Thinking of you again
Sailing away from distant shores
Sailing away from mistakes
Sailing away to the future stars
Sailing away from bad days
I can make no mistake
I can play the game
That I'm taking no risk
I can just play it fast
Crying out of my chest
I could never know
Thinking of a new day
Sailing away from distant shores
Sailing away from mistakes
Sailing away to the future stars
Staying awake from bad days
