Running low, it's getting late
Working hard, the pressure's rising
Feeling high, pushing past
All the people, get out of my way
In this crazy world you're gonna get nowhere
In this toxic city you're gonna get nothing
Swear, swear, swear, swear, swear
Swear, swear, swear, swear, baby
Swear, swear
You're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nothing
Oh, oh, oh
Oh people
You're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nothing
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, baby
