At what point did you think this was gonna be easy?
At what point did you think this was gonna be handed to you?
This is life
Every moment
Every second
As precious as the next
I don't care if you've lost
I don't care if you've failed
I don't care if you've hit bottom
As long as that hunger still lies inside
As long as that light still flickers
You fight
We fight for the people that believe in us
We fight for the moments
We fight for the seconds
We fight for the pride
We fight for the dreams
We fight
We always fight
