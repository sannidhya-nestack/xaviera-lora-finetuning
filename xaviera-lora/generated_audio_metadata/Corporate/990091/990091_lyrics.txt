To the sounds of birds in the sky
Sunny Earth, you love me now
When you're breaking up
And you've lost the spark
Has no inspiration at all
And if you're on your own
Or just heading out
Somewhere out there there's a friend to find
Welcome the sun that shines for you
Sunnier (just give me sunny weather)
Sunnier than before
Waking up (just wake me up with laughter)
To the sounds of birds in the sky
Like everywhere (the birds will sing for me)
These happy faces'round you
They're turning round (just wake me up)
With laughter
Giving you the smile
Sunny earth
To say you love me now
Every day is new
And offer something true
With open arms happiness would come
Life will turn
Get ready to fly
Sunnier (just give me sunny weather)
Sunnier than before
And waking up (just wake me up with laughter)
To the sounds of birds in the sky
Sunnier (the birds will sing for me)
Sunnier than before
And waking up (just wake me up)
With laughter
To the sounds of birds in the sky
And everywhere the birds will sing for me
Just happy faces'round you
They're turning'round so you'll love me now
Giving you the smile, it's on you
