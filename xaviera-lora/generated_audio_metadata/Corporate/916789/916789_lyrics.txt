What does it take to be perfect?
What does it take to exceed greatness?
I have spent a lifetime searching for a formula that doesn't exist
Because when it's all said and done
It comes down to the 24 hours you're given
And what you're prepared to do with it
In this life, there are people who hustle
And there are people who watch
You simply need to choose who you are
I don't care if you want to be the next bodybuilder
The next CEO, the next entertainer
Because it all comes down to a work ethic
You can have all the talent in the world
But if you're not willing to sacrifice for your dream
Then you don't have a dream
I refuse to sit back and watch another man
Go after the same dream I have had since I was a child
I refuse to sleep tonight knowing I didn't give 100 % in the 24 hours I was given
Because nothing in this life is guaranteed, nothing
So the next time that alarm goes off, I want you to think about this moment
You've got 24 hours to find a way to grind harder, to live harder, to fight harder
Because without that progression is failure
And understanding that is a step towards perfection
