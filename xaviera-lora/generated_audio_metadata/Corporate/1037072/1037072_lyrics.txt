Running low, it's getting late
Working hard, the pressure's rising
Feeling high, pushing past
All the people, get out of my way
In this crazy world you're gonna get nowhere
In this selfish city you're gonna get nothing
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, baby
Sweat, sweat
You're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nothing
Oh oh oh
Oh, people
You're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nothing
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, baby
