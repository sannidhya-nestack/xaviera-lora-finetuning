I can't help but feel what you've been feeling
What you've been dreaming, you color outside the lines
I just want to see what time's been dealing
What life's been stealing, you color outside the lines
I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-Q-Q-Q-Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q
I can't help but feel what you've been feeling
What you've been dreaming, you color outside the lines
I just want to see what time's been dealing
What life's been stealing, you color outside the lines
You, you, you, you color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color, color
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
