Free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Your love could fill the ocean
The waves are crashing down
But oh, all your loving
Oh, when I need it most it can't be found
And I receive a message in a bottle
That told me I should be
That I should be free
Your love could fill the ocean
The waves are crashing down
But oh, all your loving
Oh, when I need it most it can't be found
And I receive a message in a bottle
Told me I should be
That I should be free
Your love could fill the ocean
With waves all crashing down
But oh, all your loving
Oh, when I need it most it can't be found
And I received a message in a bottle
That told me I should be
That I should be free
