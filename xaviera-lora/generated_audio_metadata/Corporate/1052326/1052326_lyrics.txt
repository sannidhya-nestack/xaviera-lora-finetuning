This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
Tell me all your fantasies, I'll make them come to life
Right from the get-go, I'm you when you ask for mine
This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
Tell me all your fantasies, I'll make them come to life
This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
Tell me all your fantasies, I'll make them come to life
Right from the get-go, I'm you when you ask for mine
This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
This ain't a cheap thrill, I'ma ride or die
Tell me all your fantasies, I'll make them come to life
Ride from the get go on you when your eyes are mine
The things that you need babe I can supply
I'll do all I can to bring your fantasies to life
Hide any secrets you gotta be a front
I'm willing and ready to give you what you want
Feeling cold babe I'll warm you up right
