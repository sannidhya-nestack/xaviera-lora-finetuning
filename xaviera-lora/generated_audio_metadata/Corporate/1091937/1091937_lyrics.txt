There's always a rainbow somewhere
There's always a rainbow, this I believe
Just a tear from your eye, a ray of light
God's beautiful creation spreading glory across the sky
There's always a rainbow somewhere
There's always a rainbow on the other side
Believe up above the clouds
The sun still shines
And we will have to find it might take some time
We've all felt the sadness
But you know someday it'll all be done
The shadows will be lifted
When the clouds will feel the power of
Of the sun
There's always a rainbow somewhere
Search for that rainbow you have to believe
So look to the sky with hope in your heart
I know we can find it, the healing will start
The pain will fade, it'll take some time
God's beautiful creation spreading glory in the sky
I promise you rainbows, endless rainbows
I promise you rainbows
Always, always
