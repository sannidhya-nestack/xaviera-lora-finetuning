Want to stay by your side'til the night ends
Want to escape every time to another place
But I'm still here every night, every Sunday morning
You could be here, but you're gone and my heart is growin'
You say don't worry but my heart is
Ringin' and beggin' for your heartbeat
You say don't worry but I'm fallin', yeah
Just give me more love
Want to stay by your side'til the night ends
Want to escape every time to another place
But I'm still here every night, every Sunday morning
You could be here but you're gone and my heart is growin'
You say don't worry but my heart is
Praying and begging for your heartbeat
You say don't worry but I'm falling
Yeah, just give me more love
