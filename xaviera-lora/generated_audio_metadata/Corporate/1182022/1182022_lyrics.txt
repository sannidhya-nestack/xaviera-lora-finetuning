Live your life
Live your life
Leave you now, now
Leave you now, now
Leave you now, now
Dream, dream
It's my dream I have to face it
Dream, dream
It's my dream I have to chase it
Is my dream I have to face it? (Dream it, fight)
Is my dream I have to chase it? (Fight)
Dreamy old, dreamy, dreamy old, dreamy, dreamy old
