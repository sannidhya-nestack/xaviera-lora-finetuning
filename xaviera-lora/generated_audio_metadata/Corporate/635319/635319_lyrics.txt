All of us maybe waiting so long
We wonder when you'll be here
Looking for signs that you are near
And the cold wind blows
Across the desolate plains
And the grip of winter
Stirs a flame which burns
Evermore so brightly
And you take our hand
And hold it tightly
Waiting so long
We wonder when you'll be here
Waiting so long
Can have its rewards
Yeah, waiting so long
It's hard to remember
That waiting so long
Can have its rewards
Still we know
That you are always listening
Not to worry about what tomorrow brings
Our future is beyond our control
Waiting so long
It's hard to remember
That waiting so long
Can have its rewards
Yeah, waiting so long
It's hard to remember (it's hard to remember)
That waiting so long can have its rewards (have its rewards)
Waiting so long (waiting so long)
It's hard to remember
