I swear it, couldn't bear it
If I knew that you were telling me a lie
I think that I would die
I swear it, couldn't bear it
If I thought that there was someone else but me
I think I'd set you free
The wild horses couldn't drag us apart
Though there are forces that would like to pull us apart
I'm never gonna let up
I swear it, couldn't bear it
If I found that you were with another girl
I think that I'd unfurl
I swear it, couldn't bear it
If I knew that it was all about to end
I think I'd phone a friend
The wild horses couldn't drag us apart
Though there are forces that would like to pull us apart
I'm never gonna let'em
Ain't gonna let them break my heart
Ain't gonna let them even start
Ain't gonna be that kind of fool
Ain't gonna be somebody's tool
The wild horses couldn't drag us apart
Though there are forces that would like to pull us apart
I'm never gonna let'em
They won't bring her down
They won't bring her down
Ain't gonna let them break my heart
Ain't gonna let them even start
Ain't gonna be that kind of fool
Ain't gonna be somebody's tool
Ain't gonna let them break my heart
Ain't gonna let them even start
Ain't gonna make you feel a lot of hurt
Ain't gonna be somebody's tool
I swear it, couldn't bear it
If I knew that you were telling me a lie
