What can you do when the sky falls in on you
Around your feet
You take a chance and try to make it through
Rewind repeat
Again we keep driving through the night
I hope we are headed for the light
Only your dreams to lead the way out here
So bring it back and start again
Just start again
Work it out'til only love remains
Just start again
Another day and you're closer to the sun
And time is out
Line up the hours and you count them every one
So scream and shout
And still we keep driving through the day
Planning the games we need to play
Only the rules will stay the same out here
So bring it back and start again
Just start again
Work it out'til only love remains
Just start again
So bring it back and start again
Just start again
Work it out'til only love remains
Just start again
So bring it back and start again
