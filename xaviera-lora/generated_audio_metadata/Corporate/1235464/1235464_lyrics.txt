Yo, check it, listen close, let me paint the scene
I'm Black Queen, Wall Street's new regime
With a stride so fierce and a mind so keen
She's breaking barriers, living her dream
From the concrete jungle, she rose to the top
The world's her stage, she ain't never gonna stop
She be hustling, grinding, making her own way
Inspiring others every single day
She's the black queen taking control
Rising above the stereotypes that they told
She's powerful, resilient, ain't afraid to be seen
She's the black queen living out her dream
