Let me drive
I'll drive down this road
I'll, I'll drive down these roads
I'll walk low back and forth
Won't tell you where I go
Though I won't come back for you
I'll go down these roads
I won't tell you where I'm going
No, no, no
I'll, I'll drive down these roads
Let me drive
Let me drive
I won't look back anymore
Won't tell you where I go
Though I would come back for you
Won't tell you where I go
Though I would come back for you
Drive away
I'll go down these roads
I won't tell you where I'm going
No, no, no
Let me drive
More
I'll, I'll drive down these roads
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
