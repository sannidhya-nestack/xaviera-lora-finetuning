Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining now
I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I'm above the clouds
It's perfect timing
The way it all works out
Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining now
High expectations, very high stakes
Higher power knows best, we only get what we can take
My own records to break, it's not a competition
Want all my people to be great, no matter what your vision
And if you in the kitchen, better be the best chef
Live another 24, recognize that you're blessed
Tomorrow isn't promised, some people don't get
Get it while it's good, don't let ideas just sit
Pressure makes diamonds, baby keep shining
Complaining don't help, get to work and stop whining
Don't become a victim of your climate
Mountains in your path just climb it
You wasting time, keep hiking, ain't wasting mine
I got checks to sign
Working on my craft, drafts of my next design
Creative genius, I'm the best that you'll ever find
I'm just getting started, you don't see anything ever mind
You see me shining now
I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I'm above the clouds
It's perfect timing
The way it all works out
Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining now
I don't sing the blues, I get green
Power is the root, of all greed
Money is the root, of all ease
I don't need the fruits, of those seeds
Rather buy my pop, some new trees
Take'em out to cop, a two seat
Let'em drop the top
My OG, anything you want, it's on me
Bought my mama house, she wants
Start a business up, with no cuts
Everything you see, it's top notch
Stayin' on the grind, it don't stop
Whip it gotta shine, with my watch
Always stay on time, with my profits
If you in the way, get dropped
If you in the way, push up
You see me shining now
I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I'm above the clouds
It's perfect timing
The way it all works out
Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining now
I've been working on maneuvers to create my own shot
It's not a one man game but I'm nice with the rock
And I'm nice with the fade
Yeah I'm nice with the J
But at night I always pray for a team I could play
Aye thanks for the assist
I promise I won't miss
Lay it up with the kits
The roll is all risks
My roll is all gifts
So stay the 25th
Open up and see everything we wanna get
Open up and be everyday a new attempt
Be a boss gotta pay that you think you were exempt
Hit with a little hate but I don't walk with a limp
I proceed with a smile more green by the mile
Fresh shirt makes dodge
You see me shining now
I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I'm above the clouds
It's perfect timing
The way it all works out
Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining now
Pressure makes diamonds
You see me shining
Now I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I'm above the clouds
It's perfect timing
The way it all works out
Fresher makes diamonds
You see me shining now
