Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
If it's silent in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquered this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor
Resolution is the sun
I believe in love
I believe in love
Who is the one you can't find?
I believe in love
You are it
How?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
I'm right
I'm right
If it's sight and dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I can't put this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor
As the ocean is the sun
