Well, you know that you're free to come along
Yeah, together maybe write a better song
Can we make all the way? I still wonder what to say
When all I know is that now I'm glad you're here with me
But if it's how this is, we're back and forth
Why don't you say something?
Your hands would feel much better on my heart
But for now, all we have is this moment
Oh, come raise me up
Oh, come raise me up tonight
Turn it on, got something that makes my heart beat
And alarms are going off inside my head
Maybe it's our history got you standing here with me
I remember everything but for now
We're starting over here tonight
But if it's how this is, we're back and forth
Why don't you say something?
Your hands would feel much better on my heart
But for now, all we have is this moment
Come raise me up
Come and raise me up
Oh, come and raise me up
Oh come raise me up tonight
