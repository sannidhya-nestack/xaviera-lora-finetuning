Look out the window, there you are
Walking slowly from your car
You don't see, see me watching
I make excuses once again
And go and visit with a friend
There you are, predictable I am
But I can't help it
I am drawn in
My heart rises when I see you again
So I keep watching
I keep waiting for you to see
You are my island
I am running on your sands and in your seas
And I am floating in your ocean deep
You're my island, you're my sun
Call to me and I will come
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah
I make my plans, I play my cards
I drink my drinks in your favourite bars
Ooh, corruptible I am, but I can't
Drown in my heart
Rises when I see you again
So I keep watching
I keep waiting for you
To see that you are
You're my island, I am running on your sands and in your seas
And I am floating in your ocean deep
You're my island, you're my sun
Call to me and I will come home
Time moves us on, finds where we belong
Our sanctuary
But I keep you inside my island
Hide away, you're waiting there patiently
You're my island, you're my sun
Call to me and I will come, oh
You are my island, I am running on your sand and in your seas and I am floating in your ocean deep
You're my island, you're my sun, call to me and I will come
You are my island
I am running on your sand and in your seas
And I am floating on your ocean breeze
