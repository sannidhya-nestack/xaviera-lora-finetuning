(Crying)
There's a ray of sunlight breaking through the clouds
Illuminating darkness pulling back the shroud
A million rain drops dance across the sky
A single bolt of lightning cuts a jagged line
This earth turns another revolution
Everything I see leads me to one conclusion
This ain't no accident
This ain't some game of chance
This life, this love, this deep red blood that runs through all of us
It's no coincidence
We're together here
Upon this living canvas
The hand of God is clear
This ain't no accident
I can hear the spirit in my new born baby's cry
The oxygen we breathe fills his lungs and gives him life
To say it is a miracle doesn't say enough
I think about what he'll become and all his hands will touch
A star above the midnight sky is falling
It doesn't make a sound but you can hear it calling
This ain't no accident
This ain't some game of chance
This life, this love, this deep red blood that runs through all of us
It's no coincidence
We're together here
Upon this living canvas
The hand of God is clear
This ain't no accident
This ain't no accident
No accident, this ain't no accident
No accident, this ain't no accident
This ain't no accident, some random game of chance
This life, this love, this deep red blood that runs through all of us
It's no coincidence, we're together here
Upon the master's canvas, the artist's hand is clear
This ain't no accident, this ain't some game of chance
This world, this life, this love, this deep red blood
It's no coincidence we're together here
Upon this living canvas
The hand of God is clear, this ain't no accident
