I'm here in the space you made
Flickering lights that begin to fade
Just fold back the page
And watch the words tumble out
So who can I blame?
When I know that it runs the same
I singled you out
It's a feeling I can't explain
Broken glass lays under my feet and I can't come home
Broken glass as I plan my retreat so I can't come home
The needle picks up and goes
Back to the start it knows
That familiar tone
That spirals out here alone
Broken glass lays under my feet and I can't come home
