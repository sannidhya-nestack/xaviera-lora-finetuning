I'll be there soon
To wake you so discreet
Windows gap the sun
Doors invite us through
Footsteps in the sand
Sleep'til I come home
Dream of something sweet
I'll be there soon
To wake you so discreet
Windows got the sun
Sleep'til I come home
Dream of something sweet
I'll be there soon
To wake you so discreet
Windows got a sun
