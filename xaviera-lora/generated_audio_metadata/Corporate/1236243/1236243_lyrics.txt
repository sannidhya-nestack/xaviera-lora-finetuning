In the morning light, the world begins to wake
A brand new day, a chance to celebrate
With every step we take, we're riding our own fate
So let's make it great, let's make it resonate
On this journey we'll find our way
Through the ups and downs come what may
With love and hope we'll light the day
In every moment we'll find a way to stay
We'll dance along with every beat
We'll sing our song with laughter in our hearts
We'll carry on together but we're strong
Together we belong
More than strong, together we belong
On this journey we'll find a way
Through the ups and downs come what may
With love and hope we'll light the day
In every moment we'll find a way to stay
