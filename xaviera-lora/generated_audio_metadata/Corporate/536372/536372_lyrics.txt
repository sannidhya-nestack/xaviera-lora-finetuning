It never worked out fine, I watched it fall away
It slipped right through my fingers as I heard you say
We're still the same, you know
I feel the stillness
Feel the stillness now
With all the days we learned
We're always one
We're always one somehow
You said never let me go
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
Remember then
In the lines of my face
Would you know me now?
Not here in my place
Just when you think it's done
It comes right back at you
And you can't find the light
They said would guide you through
We're still the same you say and
I can't hear your voice, I hear your voice
It's no good answering if this is not your choice, it's not your choice
You said never let me go
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
You said never let me go (you said never let me go)
You said never let me go (you said never)
Remember then, in the lines of my face
Would you know me now, not here in my place
