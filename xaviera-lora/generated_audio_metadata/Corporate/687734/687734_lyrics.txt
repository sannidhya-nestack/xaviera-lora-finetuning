The wind has returned everything you've learned
But now I have a place
Now I have a name
Once you find it
What will you do with it?
You may find that nothing's broken yet
'Cause you only have this life
To love or be in love
And now all you left
Shine a little light
Just try to do what's right
And this laugh will beat you down
Make you feel like you lost your crown
But it's up to you to find your way
Find the light and make it stay
Once you're fine, don't you lose your head
you only have this life
To love be life
A new one you'll live
Shine a little light
You don't have to fight to make you win
You have it all inside
Open up your heart and you make it happen
You only have, only have this life
To love and be alive
And now I want you to live
Shine a little light, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
