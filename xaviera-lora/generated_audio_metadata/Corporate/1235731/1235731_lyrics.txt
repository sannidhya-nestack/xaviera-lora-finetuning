Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hit it up now
I, I, I, I, I, I, hey, hey, hey, hey
I, I, I, I, I, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ten
Lipstick ruby red and nine
Wear my black eyeliner
Eight
Put on the war paint
Seven
Wear my lucky blouse
Six, bet my milk chocolate fever's five
Find my high heel sneakers
Four, see me walk the floor
And three, my ripped blue jeans
Two, switch to my Daisy Dukes
One, all systems go
Countdown to love
Countdown to love (countdown to love)
Countdown to love (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Countdown to love (countdown)
Countdown
That boy doesn't stand half a chance
If I give him even half a glance
I'll let him catch me then rock his world
A woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do
Don't judge me, I won't judge you
I'll spare your love and war
That don't make me a horrible girl (no no no no)
Ten, lipstick ruby red and nine
Wear my black eyeliner
Eight, put on the war paint
Seven, wear my lucky blouse
Six, bet my milk chocolate deepers
Five, find my high heel sneakers
Four, see me walk the floor in
Three, my ripped blue jeans
To switch to my Daisy Dukes
One all systems go
Countdown to love (countdown to love)
Countdown to love (countdown to love)
Countdown to love (countdown to love)
Countdown to love
Count down to love
Count down to love, count down
Count down to love, count down
Count down to love, count down
Count down to love, baby
