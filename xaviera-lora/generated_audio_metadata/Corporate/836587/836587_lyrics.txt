Came a long way, can't believe I made it this far
Riding round in this car, transformed into this star
Having to work this hard was worth it, found my purpose
Went from the abyss to the surface, the reward of constantly working
Aye, and now I'm finally eating
Aye, the mission's been completed (been completed)
Yah, can't y'all see I can't be beaten (I can't be beaten)
Infinity and oh, I will never be defeated
Several years in my twenties I never took a day off
Used to stay up all night hustling till I'd finally days off
Rookie of the rap game man made the playoffs
Made it through the recession and layoffs
Didn't get prison time like Bernie made up
It was money or the girl so I made the trade off
Toast to the underpaid I'm paid off
Took a fast break now the whole team getting fast cake
Hundred dollar bills fill the ashtray
Inspiration never reached, so no passing
Hairdo's a topping on my parents' gas tanks
J .K. promoter's work, brush off the shoulders
Question those opposed to my reign since they were older
Salute to the real dudes who were standing behind me
Before I had just a peel through, uh
Ooh, a piece of candy, ooh, a piece of candy
Ladies make it clap, cheeks sandy
Put out my handy-dandy notebook
About to change the light with a prize
Oprah, brain blast never held Laura Poultra
But your chicken's so easy in comparison
Clear through competitions on claritins
Roll around in a whip that you're staring in
You know so dark don't know on who that you're appearing in
Concentrate on the mission that I'm giving
Consistent in the rap game get your plenty
Nobody deserves anything from me except my mother
And if I died today wouldn't change this life or name
Came a long way can't believe I made it this far
Riding around in this car transformed into this
Stopped having to work this hard was worth it found my purpose
Went from the abyss to the surface the reward of constantly working
Ayy, and now I'm finally eatin'
Ayy, the mix has been completed
Yah, can't y'all see I can't be beaten
Infinity and oh, I will never be defeated
If I change the world, what's next?
That's a bonus, every other rapper helps these people sleep melatonin
Man, I done made it to the promised land
Seems yesterday I was sittin' in my momma's van
Movin' me up the chain, yeah, it took a lotta hands
Invested in my future and it took a lotta grand
Fam gave me everything they had, took'em all to get a tan
On Miami Beach, where the sun mesmerized and put you to sleep
Now I can't even speak
See how I've been blessed
Can't even think of this journey being any more perfect
And we barely opened the curtains
Two thumbs up reviews coming soon
That I am certain
It was we walking the earth without a purpose
It was continuous
Soul searching kept my head high
But I tried to put my hands to the sky
Promised that I would fly
I died and I failed attempt
Competition wanted me to quit but I ain't give no consent
Pray one day we no longer have to worry about paying the rent
And those prayers were well spent
Came a long way
Can't believe I made it this far
Riding around in this car
Transformed into this star
Having to work this hard was worth it
Found my purpose
Went from the abyss to the surface
The reward of constantly working
Aye, and now I'm finally eating
Aye, the mission's been completed
Yah, can't y'all see I can't be beaten
And better than you know I will never be defeated
