I've got here alone and I'll be gone soon enough
See the blurring time, disillusioned by the truth of it
I'm writing this line out loud, out loud, out loud
Out loud
Grief about something that still exists
Morning of hopes that could be simply leaves
Joy of God spread all around the day
Bitter taste that can't keep me from crying
I know you can see the need to run but wait
I know perfectly well you feel this way
But remember, I'll burn through a day
Fire that will be knocked out by your shame
