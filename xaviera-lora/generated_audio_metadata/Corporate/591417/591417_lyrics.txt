Here alone again on this special day
This year love never found its way
Wish life would finally explain
Why my loneliness feels such pain
All alone again on this special day
Alone again on this special day
Here I stand so invisible
As people scurry around me
Trying to matter, can't they see
I wanna belong to somebody
Just need someone with me
Here alone again on Christmas day
This here love never found its way
Wish life would finally explain
Why my loneliness feels such pain
All alone again on Christmas day
Alone again on Christmas day
Can I feel much more all alone
Watching couples all around me
Wish I could have what they have
Just wanna be somebody's baby
It's Christmas day all by myself
It's Christmas day all by myself
Here alone again on Valentine's Day
This here love never found its way
Wish life would finally explain
Why my loneliness feels such pain
All alone again on St. Valentine's Day
Alone again on St. Valentine's Day
The love you feel is in the air
A sea of red hanging everywhere
Watching couples all around me
Why can't I have what they have?
Just wanna be somebody's baby
Another Valentine's day in despair
Another Valentine's day in despair
Here alone again on Valentine's Day
This year love never found its way
Wish life would finally explain
Why my loneliness feels such pain
All alone again on Saint Valentine's Day
Alone again on Saint Valentine's Day
Alone again on this special day
