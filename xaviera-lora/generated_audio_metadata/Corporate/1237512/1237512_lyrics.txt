I'm the firmest now, the same today
To make our moves, no time to delay
Clock's ticking fast, can't slow it down
But we're ready to take on any town
From the break of dawn'til the setting sun
We'll hustle hard until the job is done
(B .I .Job is done)
The time has come, so let's make ways
Break through barriers, don't decays
No eyes up high, reach for the sky
The time is now, let's amplify
Let's amplify
Got dreams to chase, goals to meet
No room for doubt, just pure heat
With passion burning deep inside
We'll push the limits, let it be our guide
No looking back, no regrets
We're on a journey, placing our bets
The time has come to stake our claim
To leave our mark and build our name
The time has come, so let's make ways
Break through barriers, conquer caves
Look wise up high, reach for the sky
The time is now, let's set the fire
Let's light the fire
Samplify
