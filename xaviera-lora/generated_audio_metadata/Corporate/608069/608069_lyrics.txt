Every moment here to stay
Breaking ground and now living for today
The light is shining beneath my eyes
Everything is clearer now
I can reach for the stars again and I say now
The world is in my arms
Now I can say just what I want
Even if time slips away
I can see better things are headed my way
I can be anything that I want
Dreams no longer hold me back
I got the powers to keep moving on and I say now
The world is in my arms
Now I can say just what I want
No obstacles in my way
A burning flame that will never go away
And I see it shining bright
Every single star aligned
I can reach for the sky again
I say now
The world is in my arms
Now
I can say just what I want
Now, the world is in my arms
Now, I can say just what I want
