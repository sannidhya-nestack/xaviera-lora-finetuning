Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Where's the kid at?
I can't lie
I used to care about
I used to care about
I used to care about
I used to care about
I used to care about
I used to care about
Going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
Positive mind, positive mind, positive mind, oh
Positive mind, positive mind, positive mind
I'm going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
Lost in the night
I just can't find it (I just can't find it)
(Must check out)
Going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you, going to leave you there
Going to leave you, going to leave you there
