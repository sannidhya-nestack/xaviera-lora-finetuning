Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
If it's silent in dismay
It won't break this feeling down
If I conquered this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor
Resolution is the sun
I believe in love
I believe in love
Tell me I'm your love
Tell me I am your love
Ooh, if you can't fall
I believe in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It hits silent in dismay
It would break this feeling down
If I could put this my way
I'd devour, I'd surround
If it hurts you just a little
Then it heals you when it's done
Disappointment is the anchor of gasoline
The ocean is the sun
