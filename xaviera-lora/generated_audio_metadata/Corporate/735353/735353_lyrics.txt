There's a lot that she's asking for
There's a lot that she's asking for
And our silence is too much
And our silence is too much
Who is it? Who is it in?
Why did you do it in?
What is there to it in?
Maybe I blew it in
Who is it? Who is it in?
Why did you do it in?
Maybe I blew it in
Lights are out and you're just left in your embrace
Just another thing I dare
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces
Believe in me
There is another tear
There's one other thing I dare
There is another tear
There is another tear
