Running low, it's getting late
Working hard, the pressure's rising
I'm feeling hot, pushing past
All the people, get out of my way
Got it now, there's nothing left
I'm burnin' out, I keep on drivin'
Burnin' up a muscle ache
Never show any pain
In this crazy world, you're gonna get nowhere
You're gonna get nowhere
In this selfish city, you're gonna get nothing
You're gonna get nothing
These white-colored flames have broken glass
And this song's on the phone, we've done it all before
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Feeling like you're gonna break
Never show any weakness
Push it down
The pressure's on
Start to feel you're gonna fail
Gotta know there's nothing left
I'm burning out
I keep on trying baby
So I'm burning out
But muscle ache, never show any pain
In this crazy world you're gonna get nowhere (you're gonna get nowhere)
In this selfish city you're gonna get nothing
So you walk through the flames and broken glass (oh)
And listen to the vocal, done it all before
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, baby
