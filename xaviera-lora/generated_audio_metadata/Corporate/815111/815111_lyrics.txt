California stays forever on my mind
California where I've got nothing left but time
I go running down a dream I couldn't be anything in California
I'm heading for the sunshine in a new life in LA
No matter what it takes, yeah, I'm gonna do it my way
These streets of gold were paved before me
Just wait and see
California stays forever on my mind
California
Where I've got nothing left but time
I go running down a dream I could be anything
In California
Walking down sunset wind blowing through my hair
Feels warmer than that small town where I was going nowhere
I finally found a place where I can be wild and free
California stays forever on my mind
California
Where I've got nothing left but time
I go running down a dream I could be anything
In California
I'm chasing down a dream I could be anything
I'm running so fast the neon lights are all I see
And they're all for me
In California
California
Stays forever on my mind
California
Where I've got nothing left but time
I go running down a dream I could be anything
In California
I go running down a dream, I could be anything
I'm running so fast in neon lights, you're all I see
Oh, I can be, I can be anything
In California
In California
