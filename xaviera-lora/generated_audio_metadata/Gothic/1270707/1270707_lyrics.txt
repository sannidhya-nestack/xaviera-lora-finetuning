Digit screens light up our eyes
But connection fades in hopes of signs
We scroll through lives we'll never leave
Chasing dreams we cannot feed
Lost in the recesses of a broken age
Running programs in a gilded cage
We are the voices, we are the cries
Seeking meaning in an oceanic sky
Learned with debts we cannot pay
Building futures built on clay
Promises fade like falling stars
We're led to here, it's hidden scars
Lost in the recesses of a broken age
Running programs in a gilded cage
We are the voices, we are the cries
Seeking meaning in an ocean of time
Digital screens light up our eyes
Our connection fades in hopes of size
We scroll through lives we'll never leave
Chasing dreams we cannot feed
Lost in the recesses of a broken age
Running programs in a gilded cage
We are the voices, we are the crowds
Seeking meaning in an oceanic skull
Is there a way to break these chains?
To find the sun beyond the rain
We'll rise above, we'll find our way
Tomorrow brings a brand new day
Lost in the recesses of a broken age
Running programs in a gilded cage
We are the voices, we are the cries
Seeking meaning in an oceanic sky
