Hate, her masquerade is hiding her rage
Hate, she needs revenge, projection to cleanse the soul
She walks on water (walks on water) walking on water now (walking on water)
She walks on water (walks on water) walking on water now (walking on water now)
She's living a masquerade, leading a hate parade
Hate, discriminate, deception, the game
Hate, his knowledge feeds (Back to the memory, back through it all)
His righteous crusades (Back to the memory, back through it all
He walks on water (walks on water)
Walking on water now (walking on water)
He walks on water (walks on water)
Walking on water now (walking on water)
He's living a masquerade
This ain't for Rick
They walk on water (walk on water) walking on water now (walking on water)
They walk on water (walk on water) walking on water now (walking on water)
They're living a masquerade leading this hate parade
