(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
You must face him (you must face him, you must face him)
You must face it
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on dreams
You must face it
You must face it
We born, we fed, we raised on dread
We born, we fed, we raised on dread
We born, we fed, we raised on dread
We're racing on drag, we're going fast, we're racing on drag
