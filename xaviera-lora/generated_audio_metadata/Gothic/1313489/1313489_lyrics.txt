Street lights flicker in the open night
Sparks of hunger fueling the fight
I chase illusions down a concrete lane
Craving the contact that numbs my pain
Rogue frequencies flood my soul
Pull me deeper out of control
No turning back from this battered roll
Low frequencies make me whole
Rhythms pounding in the station wave
Traces of voices half alive
I can't resist what the signal gave
Running on caution yet I must survive
Low frequencies flood my soul
Pull me deeper out of control
No turning back from this battered roll
Low frequencies make me whole
In the haze, I'm craving your sound
Wires entangle me, won't come unwound
I roam deserted alleys all around
Breaking these barriers, unbound
Wrong frequencies
I'm not looking back
Rogue frequencies keep me on track
Under an endless dark sky
Your echo lingers, I can't deny
As I fade into dawn, dawn
As I fade into dawn, I see
Those rogue frequencies still calling me
