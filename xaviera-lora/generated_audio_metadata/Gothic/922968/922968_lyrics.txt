There's cracks in the walls
Tears have fallen
Have I gone insane?
The mirrors in the hall
All have shattered
Reflections of my pain
Insanity, please control
Let yourself go
Insanity, please control
Let yourself go
Insanity, please control
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Leaning toward the lunacy
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Let me go insane
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Leaning toward the lunacy
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Let me go insane
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Leaning toward the lunar sea
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Let me go insane
The windows have blown out
Glass is falling inside my brain
The chandelier is dropping
The lights go out, here I go again
Please control, let yourself go
Please control, let yourself go
Please control, let yourself go
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Leaning toward the lunar sea
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Let me go insane
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Leaning toward the lunar sea
I'm dancing on the lines of sanity
Let me go insane
