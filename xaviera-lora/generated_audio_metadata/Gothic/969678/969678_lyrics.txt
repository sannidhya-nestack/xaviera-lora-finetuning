I'm your doll, unleash my charm
I'm your doll, I've come to do you harm
Suffocating in a suitcase
After all these years
I'll never be like Cindy
I'm just a tiny tears
Still hiding in a suitcase
I wanted to escape
Now running wild
This plastic child
I'm your doll, unleash my charm
I'm your doll, I'm come to do you harm
Suffocating in a suitcase
After all these years
I'll never be like Cindy
I'm just a tiny tears
Still hiding in a suitcase
I wanted to escape
Now running wild
This plastic child
I'm coming to get you
I'm coming to get you
I'm dying to get you
I'm your doll, unleash my charm
I'm your doll, I've come to do you harm
Suffocating in a suitcase
After all these years
I'll never be like Cindy
I'm just a tiny tears
Still hiding in a suitcase
I wanted to escape
Now running wild
This plastic child
