I never thought I'd hear you call that name
All across the walk of hair
There's bleeding in my chest, it makes me scream
And I don't think we'll ever be the same
Long regrets, so long to live
With hating him, but I accept that
You opened the door
Look at the way we lie awake, defying for the truth
You got to make me light as if the ones were scared to lose
You know I'd do anything but not everything
I won't avenge my heart
No who would do that to you
All right
I can't sleep to save my life
And I'd do anything to help you through the night
I can't believe you turned the page so fast
I can't believe you walked away
So pick me up, this innocence won't last
So cut me down
Look at the way we lie awake if only for the truth
We've got the way we are to save the ones we're scared to lose
You know I'd do anything but not everything
I won't avenge my heart
No, who wants that to you?
Give it up and give in and get out cause it's over
Give it up and give in and get out cause it's over (give up, give up, give up now)
Give it up and give in and get out cause it's over (give up, give up, give up now)
Give it up and give in and get out cause its over (give up, give up)
Look at the way we lie, we're waking for it, for the truth
Look at the way we lie, to save the ones we're scared to lose
You know I'd do anything but not everything (I wanna fix my heart)
No, who wants that to you?
Look at the way we lie, we're waking for it, for the truth
Look at the way we lie to save the ones we're scared to lose
