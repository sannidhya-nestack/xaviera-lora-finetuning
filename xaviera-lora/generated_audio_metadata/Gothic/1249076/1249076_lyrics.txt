Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire a 10 ,000 year fetch of how a hot desire will let me introduce you, please, to a girl who fits the bill, I think she's a velvet pill
She's a sight to see, a mess in my head, and a smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's sluts in her high heel shoes, life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion so fly, a hatchet and an airplane seat at one cost
Lots of pretty penny, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Telling hacks everywhere, trust me they're all fair in memory
Maybe she's a little more than something rich, what talk bitch, welcome to the sweet mess
Oh Miss Molly, you're the one sexy sweet on me
It's the same as you, it's more than it's money
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
More than it's money
Sweet little homie, I can see that you want facts
Take'em in and check'em open, get'em
Tell me if you got my texts
Life's not well finessed and I can see that she's been messing with some things I think you've seen that you never seen before
She's got a wallet that's quite a little fatty
Generous, she's very very very catty
Buying up the love is something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
One card, like a play-doh pie
Crashing it very hard in the market floor of hearts
All this money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Nice love but it's never ever jummy
With a trade call with greedy and high
She's a fiscal fairy for the ring buy
She's got a stockpile of suited buyers
They're all just the assets that are suited her
Just some cash that she trades her
Kiss me on the towel, don't want it
Her love's an investment, not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash registration
A loss of currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hard sold, what a portfolio
But to hit the tenth of luck she'll never really know
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
A marquee of romance, she maneuvers with ease
While assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend two seas
She's a petty bitch, sure with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss money, oh
The army's not lost, can't budge it's a loss
It's an endless cost, just bankruptin'
The market hearts of fiscal failure torn apart
But all this money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
All this money, you're one sexy sweet honey
They should save you a torrent of this money
Now you got a little wood you like a little wood what?
I care for them that seem to lose their fees
But her assets are gold, they'll never please
The gallant tone of her heart is empty, freeze
But oh how she'll spend two seas
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Rushed bankrupt in the market heart
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still sight
In the old hard cash of the night
Miss Money
She's not Johnny, wife, love, but it's never Johnny
With twin holes, great in her eyes
She's a physical fairy fluttering by
So handsome, that's funny
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend two seas!
So here's to Mes Maridah!
So here's to Mes Maridah!
The colds in the pines, the scourge of ice
