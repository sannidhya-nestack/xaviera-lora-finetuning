Oh, how sad it is that
We'll see the face of beauty and death
As golden days soon turn grey
These senses fail and run away
Revealing truths that are always high
Live inside our secrets
Earthly pain stays pure and hard where youth remains
For on this day, lovely June, I wish my soul would be immune
To fate from deadly ancient time, just let this youth be always mine
