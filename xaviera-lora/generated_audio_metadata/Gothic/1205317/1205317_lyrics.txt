I am lost
My hands begin to shake
And I want you out of my head
The ground beneath me breaks
And I'm barely containing myself
The walls begin to move
I wish this were over real soon
My hands begin to shake
And I want you out of my head
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I am lost
My hands begin to shake
And I want you out of my head
The ground beneath me breaks
And I'm barely containing myself
The walls begin to move
I wish this were over real soon
My hands begin to shake
And I want you out of my head
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
I don't care what you want
[Silence]
