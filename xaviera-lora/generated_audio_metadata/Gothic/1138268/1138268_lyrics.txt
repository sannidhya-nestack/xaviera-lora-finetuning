Here in this church, but in the silence
Earthen and flesh, which are all to remain
Fathers and sons, they are all together
Laying here, above the moon and dying
Yet behind this wall
Our enemies lying in wait
We did through
The fearless ones are
Our switch exploded
On two ways straight
A son of flesh will fight this night
Crowns down, raise your guns for if they call
Remember we also said
We'll fight to our last breath
It's a cryptic story
Words are turning
Fingers snapping
Power is ripping
Our voices we never taking
The end of two ways
Smoke, don't be enemy
For the feeling lives my life
It's cool, I'll be killed
You know to waste
Smoke, don't be enemy
For the feeling lives my life
It's cool, I'll be killed
But it's up to me
My brain is slipping
Baby you're rich
Leave your, leave your soul
Live a full, full life
