Under the blood red light they met
Stars aligned on a creepy set
Heart beats loud like a spooky drum
Chains and ghosts but love has come
Monsters lurk and shadows fall
She found love behind a haunted wall
Eyes so dark yet full of dreams
Love brings light in a horror scene
Monsters lurk and shadows fall
She found love behind a haunted wall
Eyes so dark yet full of dreams
Love brings light in a horror scene
Fall for real on a set of screens
Love is more than what it seems
Through the fake and through the fright
Hearts entwine in the dead of night
In the script where zombies roam
They found a place they could call home
Laughs that echo in the night
Love blooms in the pale moonlight
Through the masks and shadows deep
Kisses stolen, waffles sweet
In the place where nightmares thrive
She brought love back to life
Full for real on the set of screams
Love is more than what it seems
Through the fake and through the fright
Hearts entwine in the dead of night
Fall for real on the set of screams
Love is more than what it seems
Through the fake and through the fright
Hearts entwine in the dead of night
