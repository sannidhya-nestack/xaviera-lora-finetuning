In a world draped in murky hue
I sense your presence shining through
Your silent call floods all I am
A solemn vow, a cryptic sham
Oh these dreams pull me higher
Where gloom collides with dire
I chase the hushed blood burnt like fire
Bound within this eclipse desire
In the ruins of a broken shrine
I trace the symbols left behind
Your essence leads me to the core
Where longing grows I crave it more
Oh these dreams pull me higher
Where gloom collides with dire
I chase the hush but burn like fire
Bound within this eclipsed desire
Whisper, swirl in fractured air
Secrets bloom, though none may care
We dance on edges, souls unspun
Holding on until we're undone
Eclipse desire, I can't resist
Eclipse desire, I still persist
When the final dawn appears
I clutch the echoes of your tears
Through haunted worlds I wander on
Eclipse desire never gone
