White straps and buckles, our tender embrace
French kissing tablets that make you fake
Electroshoticles, boudoirs with padding
Undying love, my imagining
Roses are red, kisses blue
Love is crazy, and I am too
Crazy, crazy for you
Crazy, crazy for you
In this world you love me
Warm limbs entwined
Your orders don't restrain
My name not reviled
There's no hurt
And big boys don't cry
The only debts are little
And you're still alive
Roses are red, kisses blue
Love is crazy, and I am too
Crazy, crazy for you
Crazy, crazy for you
Your yum-yum body they'll never find
The only remains in my mind
Your heart at last mine
In a pastry puff with a glass of wine
Delicious
Roses are red, kisses blue
Love is crazy, and I am too
Crazy, crazy for you
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
