Hear the words that no one wants to hear
Words that they fear dare hate for me serious
They think that with my death
What the words represent will perish with my final breath
Hate me, berate me
That stuff can't be desecrated
Like your real guilty messenger
Hate me
Horate me
Massacrate me
Dissecrate my
Bureal purity messenger
