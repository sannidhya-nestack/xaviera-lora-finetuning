It's all just a matter of time before we fall, before we fall and shatter in line
Even though the bar is so high it's hard to reach and it's hard to see the other side
And so, we've done it all before
And all my friends, and all my friends have kept the score
It's 1-0, not like it mattered before
I can feel your breath chasing me through every door
And all my friends, they all, they all, they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all They all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all They all, they all wanna know
Standing low, we're standards making free with the ground
It's overgrown, so all the rest are climbing around
Dinosaur, over and out
Time to fly, if it can fly we're standing in south
And all my friends, they all, they all, they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends, they all, they all They all, they all wanna know
This is the last time, I swear that this is over
This is the last time, I swear that this is over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time, I swear that this over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time I'm straight if this over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time I'm straight if this is over
This is the last time
This is the last time
And all my friends, they all, they all
They all, they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends
They all, they all, they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends
They all, they all, they all, they all wanna know
And all my friends
They all, they all, they all, they all wanna know
