All I know is wrong
I wish I knew where I belong
It's a new house, it's a new street, it's a new town, it's a new school, it's a new church
This is new ground for you to sit in
Again it's overwhelming, I'm just a simple man
Fell in love with a narcissist
All I know is wrong
I wish I knew where I belong
It's a new taste, it's a new smell
It's a new sight, it's a new sound
It's a new pain, it's a new sense for your loneliness
It gets overwhelming, I'm just a simple man
Without tasteful creating disease
All I know is wrong
I wish I knew where I belong
It's a new queue, it's a new life, it's a new fraud, it's a new cheat, it's a new crime
The minds lost in a recklessness
It gets overwhelming, I'm just a simple man who has no time for division
All I know is wrong
I wish I knew where I belong
No matter what I say
It gets overwhelming, I'm just a simple man
I'm just a simple man
