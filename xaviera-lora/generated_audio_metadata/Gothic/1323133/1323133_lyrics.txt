In the chapel of your sins I'll add a flame
Burning prayers with every whispered name
Your kiss a blade divine profane
Still I beg to feel that ache again
You are my poison and devotion
My sweetest brew, my blackest ocean
Drown me deep in velvet night
Rough me wrong and kill me right
You wear despair like a wedding dress
A requiem sewn in tenderness
My heart, a grave you softly tread
I live for you, though love is dead
You are my poison and devotion
My sweetest fool, my blackest ocean
Drown me deep in velvet night
Love me wrong and kill me right
Please slowly take your time
Every scar a sacred sign
I'll smile beneath the roses red
If I can die where you once bled
You are my poison and devotion
My sweetest fool, my last emotion
Bury me in your twilight
Love me, romantic rides
