You're wicked, worth blackmail and arrest
Suckers, reels from murdered sins
Brainwashed of human beings
An obsession of lust
The need of your flesh
The smell of your skin
I shot you with my dream
An obsession of lust
The need of your flesh
The smell of your skin
I shot you with my dream
I'll come in the trap
Don't be extreme
I'll come in the trap
Don't be extreme
I'll come in the trap
Don't be extreme
I'll come in the trap
Solitude inside yourself
A empty heart left in the shelf
Seeking an object of pleasure and obsession
Billions of moons are passing by
Secret door left open wide
Showing terror and destruction
Go big dream, I'll go big dream
Go big dream, I'll go big dream
Go big dream, I'll go big dream
Go big dream, I'll go big dream
An obsession of lust
The need of your flesh
The smell of your skin
I shocked you with my dream
An obsession of lust
The need of your flesh
The smell of your skin
I shocked you with my dream
