She sees you walking outside
She reaches out, are you ready?
She's got nothing left to hide
Is your soul still?
I got what you need
Won't you take me home?
I got what you really want
Better hear what she said
They won't tear me up
They won't bring me down
That won't pick me up
On my broken bones
On my broken bones
She sees you walking outside
She reaches out, are you ready?
She's got nothing left to hide
You better hear what she said
They won't tear me up
They won't break me down
They won't beat me up
On my broken bones
