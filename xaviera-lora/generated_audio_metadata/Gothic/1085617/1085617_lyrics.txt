They're closing down the clubs
They're closing down the cities
It's a golden era shopping mall
So they'll keep us dumb with them news icons
As we buy stupid things we don't need
Reality shows making famous everyday become a deal of celebrity
The emptiness of our hopeless dreams
This all we ever want to be
So we all feel at home
And we pray for the west to our false god democracy
They pretend our opinions really count
We pretend that we're really free
Now it's time to turn the television on
And if darkness falls we won't go out again
There's a media blackout on the voices of dissent
That they lead us to another war
There's a pokey man bearing arms in the west
They deny that it's all about oil
There is a real war, it's not the one we think
It's the one which brought the rich upon the poor
When it takes them all greed they've taken everything
And now they're coming back for more
So we all stay at home and we pray to the west
To a false god democracy
They pretend our opinions really count
We pretend that we're really free
Now it's time to turn the television on
As darkness falls we won't go out again
They're wiring every town, they're wiring every street so they can monitor us everywhere we go
We've seen CTV and satellite spikes, know we could never be alone
MR5 are being desolated and they say our roads are civil liberties
But what do we care if we've lost our rights, time is the television time
So we all say long pray to the west, to a false god democracy
They pretend their opinions really count
We pretend that we're really free
Now it's time to turn the television on
This darkness falls, we won't go out again
Now it's time to turn the television on
This darkness falls, we won't go out again
We'll never take the streets again
Wake up, look around, we're under heavy manners
We'll never take the streets again
More water can and wedding, pay more by our taxes
We'll never take the streets again
Stare it all down, it's the only solution
We'll never take the streets again
The goal is freedom but it doesn't apply to us
