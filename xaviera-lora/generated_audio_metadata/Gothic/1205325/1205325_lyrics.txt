It's cold outside
It's a dead of night
I'm not afraid
I'll put up a fight
I'll run away
I'll hide
You won't end this night
But through tried
How could I know
It was always you
You've been exposed
Now seek the truth
You'll run away
You have
For this I'll end your life
With delight
Go, go, go, go, go, go, run, run, go, go, run away, run away, run away
Go run away, go run away, go, run away, go, run away, go, run away, go
So see to your life
Have put the feet in your right
It won't be long till you're fine
It won't be long till you're alive
And now run, run, run, run
Go, go, go, go, go
Run, run, go, go
Run away, run away, run away
Gotta run away, gotta run away, gotta run away, gotta run away
Gotta run away, gotta run away, gotta run away, gotta run away
First seen in your life
Have put the seed in your eyes
It won't be long'til you're mine
It won't be long'til you're mine
