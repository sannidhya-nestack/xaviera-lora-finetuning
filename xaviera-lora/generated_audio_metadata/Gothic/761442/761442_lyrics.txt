Holy temple that I am bowing to
Such a mystery
I'll drink of your blood
I'll taste your flesh
Enter me
Got their own God
Why can't I have mine?
Take me
I'll pray for you to conquer me
Give me a sign
My soul, full of sin without your touch
Is now divine
Everyone's gone
They're all God
Why can't I have mine?
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Get up off your knees if you wanna be free
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Here's to what you mean to me
Get up off your knees if you wanna be free
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Everyone's got their own God
I want you to be mine
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Get up off your knees if you wanna be free, yeah
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Save me, save mine, save my soul
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Get up off your knees if you wanna be free, yeah

Can't you see what you mean to me?
