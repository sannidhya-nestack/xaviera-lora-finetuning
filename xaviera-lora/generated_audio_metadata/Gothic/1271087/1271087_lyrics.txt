Friday night, Manhattan, I'm feeling electric
I hit the sleepy jeep and it sure wants to come tight
Gonna lose myself in the cities tonight
The heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, the heat, The Heat!
You can tell me what you think
Studio 64, Disco's on the air
And the world has watched you
With your intellectual glare
I'm sick and I can't hear you, oh
I take the night, but I'm so right
I'm deep, I'm deep, I don't heed
When you are gone, you can't consume me
But I know that it's me, I see you
It's just a mirage, a bunch of pain
Then I see you in the city
Through the noise and broken glass
We find our steps, let's make it really last
The city's pulse is louder than our doubt
We're hearing this together, we can work it out
Every face holds stories never told
We're strangers now, I see you're growing bolder
Colder in the chaos, something very real
Connections lasting moments, a New York City feel
So I didn't mind standin' high
I feel more like a guy who's sick and jitties
The rhymes are playin' tight
Gonna lose myself in the city, that's alright
The city said they'll be, like he's
City loves me, I think they're coming
The moonlight is a pity
I didn't mean to send her back
Let's meet and have a drink
You can tell me what you think
I love my heaven, I'm pure electric
Footprint through the chasm of night
It's loose and raw
It's chasing every moment
Living fast and free
Underneath these streetlights
It's just you and me
In the quiet homes of early dawn
When the city's night is almost gone
We'll walk the streets, you and me
In this chamber made for three
In the quiet of the early dawn
And when the city's nasty, almost gone
Don't watch this shit, it's just you and me
And this table makes more sense
