Baselines blooming concrete too
Fog rolls slow through vinyl glue
Footsteps circle breath and sink
Chalice rays no time to think
Walls remember every tone
Calling strays to flesh and bone
Batcave communion, hearts collide
Sing the promise we can't hide
Every pulse becomes a sign
Batcave communion, cross the line
Hymns of reverb climb the stair
Painted dreams dissolve the air
Spirals form where spirits sway
Louder than the light of day
Walls remember every toll
Calling strays to flesh and bone
Batcave communion, hearts collide
Sing the promise we can't hide
Every pulse becomes a sign
Batcave communion, cross the line
Let the tempo carve the night
Ancient drums ignite the right
Hands entwine, the room ascends
Rapture where the darkness bends
Bad cave communion, hearts collide
Sing the promise we can't hide
Every pulse becomes a sign
Bad cave communion, cross the line
That gave communion across the line
