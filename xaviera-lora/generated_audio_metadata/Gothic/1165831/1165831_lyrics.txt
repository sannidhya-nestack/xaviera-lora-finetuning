(I'm not gonna die)
(I'm not gonna die)
Follow me, I'll make you pray
I promise that I won't let you down
If only they all begged this way
Oh, you'll scream but you won't make a sound
Wonder why no one's around
They're forsaken, forsaken through
You just met the end of days
And nothing will ever be the same
Promise you won't run away
Oh, you'll scream but you won't make a sound
Wonder why no one's around
The forsaken, forsaken you
No, you're the creature in the cell
Back to when the world turned around
It's taking, taking you
