Don't you humor me
Will you send me a bluff?
Egotistical
I'll have the last laugh
Talk behind my back
See if I care
You better not face me
Don't even dare
I, I, I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ah
Don't you say those things
When all I want to hear
Is larger than life
They're running in fear
You're a yes man
I wanna say no
You better not disagree
Before you know more
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
And if I don't like you, I'll say it to your face
Honest in the end, it's not a disgrace
Lower your defenses
I'll be your god
Experimental
With total disregard
Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy
Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy
I, I, I, I, I, I,
