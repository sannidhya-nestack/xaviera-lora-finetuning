The melody is sound asleep and all the lights are gone
My heartbeat is faster than a train and words turn
To worthless nothing songs and the lights are turned on
All I see is them until my feet hit the ground again
One, two, three, four
And I won't breathe another breath until the air is better
Until my love starts decaying in
I want nothing else but to love this
I'd rather burn it out than surrender
I want nothing else but to love this
I'd rather burn it out than surrender
The melody is sound asleep and all the lights are gone
My heartbeat is faster than a train and words turn to worthless nothing songs
And my lights are turned on
All I see is them until my feet hit the ground again
One, two, three, four
I won't breathe another breath until the air is better
Until my lungs start their caving in
I want nothing else but to love this and I'd rather burn in hell than surrender
I want nothing else but to love this and I rather burn in hell than surrender
