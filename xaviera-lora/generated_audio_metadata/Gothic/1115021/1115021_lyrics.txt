While the kids are messing with the man
Shell game, master plan
Can't stop, can't stop moving
Can't stop, oh my my my curse
Stomping in the street
Colors, they are rising to our feet
Oh my, oh cow, oh wicked wolf, ah ha
Na na na na na na na na na
And while the pawns are playing left and right
Slide the truth out of sight
Can't stop, can't stop chilling, can't stop
Oh my my my colors, good God
Stompin' the street, colors
We are rising to our feet
I can't say it like it was, how?
Na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na na
