The architecture of my own well-being
Ashes of grace over the ocean deep
That's all one, two, two, one
Shallow death of feeling
We're blessed with a modern ease
We're all ingested, peeled through teeth
These are the wives
These are the ruffies
Below heaven's Christmas
I will rise below the sky
Lead all your troops
And we'll wave through the wreckage
And anchor myself to you
Anchor myself to you, breathe
I'm always here to help you calm
But I'm like a poster boy for burning candles by the dawn
You're as well
You're as well
Take yourself back
Breathe and dive back in again
Trade an eye
For an eye
With our lives we sacrifice
And we dance among the stars
And we left it all behind
And the black spot on your navel jaw
And I'll anchor myself to you, anchor myself
When they all jump ship, I dive in with them
When they all jump ship, I dive in with them
When they all jump ship, I dive in with them
When they all jump ship, I dive in with them
Black homes are in this block you said painted
Black homes are in this block you said painted
Black homes are in this block you said painted
Black homes are in this block you said painted
When they own your ship
When they own your ship
When they own your ship
When they own your ship
