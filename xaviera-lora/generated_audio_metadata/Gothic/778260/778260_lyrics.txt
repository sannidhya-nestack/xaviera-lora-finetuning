Sirens in the back, chopper at my top
Cruising down the 405 and I won't be stopped
I got the wind in my hair and the two midget loud
Better get out of my way so you don't get wowed
Hey everybody
Try and catch my ass
Hey everybody
Watch me hit the gas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, you alright, you alright, alright
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and me, baby, gonna fly and die
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Come with me now to the other side
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, you alright, you alright, alright
Headin' past the border, back in T .I .J.
I got a 40 in my hand, and a girl on the way
She finally shows up to my room, and she says we're late
We got a donkey show to catch, there's no time to waste
I said, "Hey, little mama, we gonna watch that from the car"
She said, "Hey, little papa, boy, I am the star"
Ooh, ooh
Honey you a ride, you a ride, you a ride, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You and me baby gonna fly and die, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come with me now to the other side, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Honey you a ride, you a ride, you ride, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
If you're a bad girl, you make my head twirl
Full throttle I stick it in
Yeah from the first time
I saw you in that parking lot
I knew you were the one for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, you're a ride, you're a ride, you're a ride
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and me, baby, gonna fly and die
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh
Come with me now to the other side
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby you a ride, you a ride, you a ride
Baby you a ride, you a ride, you ride
You and me baby gonna fly away
Come with me now to the other side
Baby you a ride, you a ride, you ride
