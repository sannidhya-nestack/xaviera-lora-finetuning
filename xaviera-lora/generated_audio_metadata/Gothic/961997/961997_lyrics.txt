Ready like gold, we're on the road
Can't take my freedom, everyone knows
Swimming through the city with the feet
All chilled up, no retreat
Noise, noise, skew the boy
Noise, noise, skew the boy
Noise, noise, skew the boy
Noisy noise, skinny boy
Simon says, leave the press
Cheers in my head, the oppressed
To offer a lot, tearing through
Lungs we stick, with our crew
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noisey noise, scooter boy
Noise and I, student boy
Noise and I, student boy
Noise and I, student boy
Noise and I, student boy
