She's a femme fatale, a bit of a mystery
I'd really like to know her history
She's got a recent fury, and a crime to wage
She's got a mind and a like to engage
She got in your car and drove out west
She wants to get away from what she detests
She can keep on running and trying to hide
But she'll never escape from what's inside
Everywhere she goes she hears her voices
She feels the effects of memories and choices
And she's so toxic, I think this girl should wise up
Wise up, wise up, wise up, wise up
She's like the names I've known, the supplements she's known
She's like a time bomb, it's gonna explode
I can't keep her calm when I'm intoxicated
I wanna be her man
I'm so typical, wanna be loved if I could stand for madness
You and her trust, I could give her the things she's never had
She's so exhausting, she's driving me mad
Everywhere she goes she hears low voices
She feels the effects of her regrets and choices
she's so flexible, I think this girl should wise up
Would it be so that she took a chance on me?
I could help her to be what she wants to be
She's laughing like, "Hmm, I never get it"
If I was to lose her now, it would be a sin
Everywhere she goes she hears her voices
She feels the effect of every break of choices
But she's so toxic, I think this girl should wise up
Everywhere she goes she hears low voices
She feels defective and regrets her choices
And she's so toxic, I think this girl should wise up
