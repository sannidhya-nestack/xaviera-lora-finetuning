You said you liked making girls cry
Well, I don't cry, I just write
And when I write, I do it to describe
I saw the blemish under your right eye
I saw you mirror check your beard and style it
I heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
His first instruction
Worked well to preface the rest
Don't have a breakdown
They won't believe you
Authority gets respect
Comply or suffer
Comply or suffer
Comply or suffer
Comply or suffer
Comply or suffer
You said you liked making ghosts cry
Well, I don't cry, I just write
And when I write, I do it to describe
I saw the blemish under your right eye
I saw you mirror check your beard and style it
I heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
You've a way with words, it's a shame you can't use'em right
Just leave it with me
Sorry I just can't, I'm not gonna tell you why
Enjoy the silence
You said you liked making girls cry
Well, I don't cry, I just write
And when I write, I do it to describe
I saw the blemish under your eyes
I, I saw you mirror check your beard and style it
I've heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
You're such a woman
Trust me it's the oestrogen making you crazy
Self doubt is normal
And nice in women I think are you sure you're okay
Are you sure you're okay
Are you sure you're okay
Are you sure you're okay
Are you sure you're okay
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Don't have a breakdown
You said you liked making girls cry
Well, I don't cry, I just write
And when I write, I do it to describe
I saw the blemish under your right eye
I saw you mirror check your beard and style it out
The echo in your substance-lacking smile
You said you liked making girls cry
Well, I don't cry, I just write
And when I write I do it to describe
I saw the blemish under your right eye
I saw you mirror check your beard and style it out
The echo in your substance lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance-lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance lacking smile
I heard the echo in your substance lacking smile
You sure you're okay
