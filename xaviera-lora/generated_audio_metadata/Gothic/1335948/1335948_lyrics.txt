Black satin and angel eyes
Leave me spellbound, mesmerized
Let it happen, the oceans rise
'Cause the night leaves even the moon paralyzed
If compelling is what you intend
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
There's no telling where this will end
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
Are you real? Are you real? Or a disguise?
Black satin and angel eyes
Black satin
An angel eyes (an angel eyes)
At first I was a slave in your paradise (never even overwhelmed you)
But the thirst I cook made me realize (never even overwhelmed you)
I'm addicted
Hypnotized
To black satin
And angel eyes
Black satin
And angel eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Black satin
