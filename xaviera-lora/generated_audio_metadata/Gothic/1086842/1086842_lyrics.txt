(Oh yeah)
20th birthday, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But make you pay
Hiding from sunlight
Hiding from pain
But it's alright
To have the pain
That pain
I, I, I, I, I feel so strange
That pain
I, I, I, I, I, I feel so strange
Straight to the surface
What I tell the boys
I will not give them any memory
They think they'll see you
And that's how it's done
People are so animals
I thought that I, I, I
I feel so strange
Better pay
I, I, I, I feel so strange
I feel so strange
Might make disaster
Better have you high
Making me shiver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all alone, like you're dying
It feels so strange, strange
I don't want to explain it, but I am
I feel so strange
That I, I, I, I, I, I,
I feel so strange
I feel so strange
I feel so strange
