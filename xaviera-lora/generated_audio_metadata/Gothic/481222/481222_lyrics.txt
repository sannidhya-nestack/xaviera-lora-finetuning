Upstage by how the old star would shine
I'd look all my love for I knew she was mine
Deep in my star just faded and died
I leave my face in my hands and just started to cry
You once turned up my imagination
And made me feel like nobody else
Now that love is deep intoxication
Is over and gone when I say to you
Just a pretty face with a foolish pride
Why should I shade a life with a burden so tragic and scared?
Backstage after the curtain fell
I found her with cupids still under his spell
Beckoning to me with love in her eyes
I'd greet her with hate and romantic doom
You walked out of my imagination
You made me feel like nobody else
Now that love's deep intoxication
Why should I love just a pretty face with a foolish pride?
Why should I share life with a burden so tragic and scared?
We're all looking for something
Something just so divine
Life ain't like your little love stories, no
Prince Charming's gonna make you cry
