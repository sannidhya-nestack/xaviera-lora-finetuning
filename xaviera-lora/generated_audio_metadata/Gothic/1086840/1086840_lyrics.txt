Serpentine moves in for the kill
Sucking your mind, stalling your will
Sexual memories in her womb
A worthless memento fill her tomb
A forked arm hits and sets her down
But you're full of flesh and now you're stone
A forked arm hits and sets her down
You're full of flesh now you're stone
And now it's over, you move no more
Reality figure or just folklore
She's had her fill, she lost for another
Never satisfied, she's had her own brother
In a church sit you stand alone
The concrete slabs that once were bones
In a church sit you stand alone
Concrete slabs once were bones
Medusa, Medusa, she's never gonna lose her
Medusa, Medusa, I'm falling to spare her
Medusa, Medusa, she's going nowhere
Medusa, Medusa, she just don't care now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
She just don't care now and now
