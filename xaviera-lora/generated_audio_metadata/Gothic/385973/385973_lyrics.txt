You've been there, you've seen it, you've done it all
You'll do it again
Please believe me, it's not my intention to get caught
I can't pretend I'm not attracted to your scent
So when now does this leave me well?
I know where you are
I know where you sleep
Got to cut you down
Before you cut me
Am I coming on too strong?
It has been known
Please don't talk to anyone else or I'll lock the door again
The light bulbs come out
The light bulbs come out
Please don't talk to anyone else or I'll lock the door
I know where you are
I know where you sleep
Got to cut you down
Before you cut me
Do not think that I will not hurt you through this
I see everything you do
I listen through all day
You know when you hear something but there's nothing there
Well that's me
I disappear easily
Ah c'est la plus forte
I know where you are
I know where you sleep
Got to cut you down
Before you cut me
Do not think that I will not hurt you through this
I see everything you do
I listen through walls
You know when you hear something but there's nothing there
Well that's me
I disappear easily
I set up your false care
I know where you are
I disappear
I know where you stay
I disappear
Gotta cut this out
I disappear
Before you kill me
I know where you are
I know where you sleep (I disappear, I disappear)
Gotta cut you down (I disappear, I disappear)
Before you cut me
