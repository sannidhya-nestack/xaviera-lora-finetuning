Wake up and say something
Wake up and say something
Wake up and say something (say something)
Wake up and say something
Wake up and say something
Wake up and say something (say something)
I'm gonna burn you down
I'm gonna burn you down
'Bout to spin and every second we're awake
Getting the best of us is so much we can take
Opportunities can slap us in the face
Just like a wake up call that puts us in our place
Clock is precious, hesitation is no friend
And facing choices is an option not an end
But we as dreamers can't afford to set aside
Every vision, every moment, an idea that is dying
And say something wake up and say something wake up and say something say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something wake up and say something
Taking all the hands not a moment passes by
Have you ever gone to places without right?
Only if you have the will to overcome
Then you'll imagine all that can have come undone
Every soul has got a meaning deep inside
And every meaning has a way to come alive
Bring your vision to the table and you'll see
That you can make a difference in this present ecstasy
Wake up and say something (wake up and say something)
Wake up and say something (wake up and say something)
Wake up and say something (wake up and says something)
Wake up and say something (wake up and says something)
Say something
Wake up
