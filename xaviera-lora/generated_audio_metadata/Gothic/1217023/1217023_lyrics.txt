Gazing at a diamond star
Makes me wonder where you are
Gazing at the silver moon
Makes me wonder why you left so soon
Ooh
Giant, giant, giant
Then you felt a velvet butterfly
Gazing at a diamond star
Makes me wonder where you are
Gazing at a silver moon
Makes me wonder why you left so soon
Ah, then you've touched a velvet butterfly
Butterfly
