Doctor, I've a feeling that I'm quite unwell
I've got to speak to somebody, it feels like hell
I've lots of friends and family but they say tell the doctor
Doctor, doctor, doctor
What do you mean that you can't prescribe?
And doctor, why did you just carefully describe me
As locked up before telling me to do my time?
Doctor, doctor
Doctor, I've been feeling quite unreal of late
I thought you had a demon alter ego
Caitlin Frost and she's a female and she masters a lot
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, it's ridiculous, I know that well
But you know when you responded saying what the hell
Well, I added in a comma and my comfort fell
What the hell, the hell, the hell
Pray, Doctor, tell
Have you ever been to heaven or just the dark side?
Don't tell me you've not done either, that'd quite collide
With your previous anecdotes about your rough ride, rough ride
Here we go again, another other side, Doctor
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me
