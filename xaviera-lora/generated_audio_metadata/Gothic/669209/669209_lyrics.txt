Interview with the beast
Dark one, have a seat
Lord, lust and fear
Honored, you're here
From good oceans of time
Wine with you'bout the rest of
Iron maiden dreams
Touch me, make them real
Make me burn, bleed what you need just
Give me you, my fantasy
Burn, bleed, what you need to just
Bite me, bite me, my fantasy
From dusk till dawn, stink me
There's wicked game, baby
Mustard lishes, leather kisses
Bruised bones, bleeding wrists
The rotting erotic
True death I wanted, oh
What a sad world
To love is to hurt
So make'em burn
Live to what you need just
Give me you, my fantasy
Burn me to what you need
Just bite me, bite me, my fantasy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And in the morning run, run
The lovers find hell and sing with the sun
And there is no love when there's a price
Oh, lonely virtue breeds the coldest vice
Oh, oh
Make'em burn, bleed, what you need, just give me you, my fantasy
Burn, bleed, what you need, just fight me, fight me, my fantasy
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, burn, bleed what you need
Just bite me, bite me, my fantasy
