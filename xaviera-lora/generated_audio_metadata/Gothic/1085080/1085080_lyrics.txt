You tell me to talk
As if the words are easy when you couldn't say
The problem in the first place I never found out
For myself in the worst sleep if I had it
You wouldn't hear this from me
My lips are shaking, body's aching
Stomach's swirling, my head is hurting
Eyes are crying, face is hiding
Heart's aching and drowning
You tell me to let it go
You tell me to et about it
You tell me to drop it all
But I can't stop thinking about it
At least good would happen
Something great
Is it too late to change all that?
All I ever knew
Can't stop thinking about it
Yeah, tell me to walk
now my mouth is running, if I leave
Will you come after me to sit down?
Walk into the door, you make a scene
And this is what you said to me
You tell me to let it go
You tell me to et about it
You tell me to drop it off
But I can't stop thinking about it
This could have been something great
But it's too late to change all that
All you ever knew
Can't stop thinking about it
You tell me to talk, I ive you
As if the words are easy
You tell me I won't, I won't et
So now my mouth is running
You tell me to talk, I ive you
As if the words are easy
You tell me I won't, I won't et
Snail my mouth is running you tell me to talk (talk)
I ive you you tell me to walk (walk)
Yeah yeah I tell me to talk (talk)
I ive you you tell me to walk (walk)
Yeah yeah I tell me to talk (talk)

You tell me to let it go

But I can't stop thinking about it
But this could have been something great
it's too late to change over it
All you ever knew
Can't stop thinking about it
Won't stop thinking about it
Can't stop thinking about it
Won't stop thinking about it
Can't stop thinking about it
