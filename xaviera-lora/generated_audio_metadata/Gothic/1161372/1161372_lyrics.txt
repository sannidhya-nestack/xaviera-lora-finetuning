Now, you're leaving it all behind
Throwing it all away, your love has died
You say, it's too late to change your mind
Too late to turn back now, you crossed the line
It's time to take a ride
Deep into your dark side
Find what you fear the most
And exercise this ghost
You're leaving it all behind
Throwing it all away
Your love is time
And you say
It's too late to change your mind
Too late to turn back now
You've crossed the line
So now, you're leaving it all behind
Throwing it all away, you're learning to fly
Today, it's too late to change your mind
Too late to turn back now, at least that's you
Won't tell you lies
