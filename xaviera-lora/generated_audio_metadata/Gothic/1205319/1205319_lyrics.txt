I lie awake at night wondering if she sees me
Only to realize she's in my dream
Why can't I see her eyes, I'm so ashamed
I'm feeling like a rat, trapped and amazed
Come on with me to the great unknown
Don't be scared we'll take it slow
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Don't be scared, we'll take it slow
I lie awake at night wondering if she sees me
Oh, but to realize she's in my dream
Why can't I see her eyes? I'm so ashamed
I feel like a ride, trapped in a maze
Come on with me to the great unknown
Don't be scared we'll take it slow
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Don't be scared but take it slow
