Darkest of encircles time
Takes the echoes of the light
Faces fading, distant rays
Lost within this endless maze
Time slips through my fingers like sand
Dreams are rolling to bare land
Standing where the moments die
Watching all the days go by
Silent walls closed in a din
Echoes of what might have been
Reflections in a broken glass
Fragments of a shattered past
Time slips through my fingers like sand
Dreams erode into barren land
Standing where the moments die
Watching all the days go by
