Hinges croon beneath the weight
Dusty floorboards mark the gate
Incense climbs in silent rings
Old phonograph begins to sing
Every breath becomes a note
Pulling anchors from the throne
Raven parlor, breathe me in
Silence folds beneath the din
We collide then crystallize
Raven parlor, close my eyes
Hold me steady, let us sway
Never apart till dreamers stray
Walls are lined with tattered tomes
Stories search for newer homes
Laughter drips in sugar tone
Fills the cracks in broken stone
Every pulse aligns the room
Writing hymns upon the gloom
Vinyl ghosts revolve in pine
Carving paths through mortal time
Stay until the final turn
Ash to ash we twist and yearn
Raven parlour, breathe me in
Silence falls beneath the din
We collide then crystallise
Raven parlour, close my eyes
Hold me steady, let us sway
Never part till dreamers stray
