Come on
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Why don't you see me me me me me me
Me me me me me me
Why don't you see me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I see your face looking at me
Between a place and a hard place
It's never easy for me, me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, come on
Come on, come on
Why don't you see me, me, me, me, me, me, me, come on
Why don't you, why don't you see me
Me, me, me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay ay ay ay
Why don't you see me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
You look around but you don't see me
I see your face looking at me
But I don't understand why you can't see me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I see you're looking but you don't see me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you come on
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay
Ay ay ay
Ay ay
Ay ay
Come on
Come on
Why don't you see me?
