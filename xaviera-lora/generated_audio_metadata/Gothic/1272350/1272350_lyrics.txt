Caught in the fire of your gaze like a moth that's lost in the blaze
Pulled to the edge of reason's line, surrendered sense and crossed the signs
Your voice it cuts through the fog, a siren's call that I can't ignore
Drowning deep in the pull of your sway, every thought just drifts away
Do you feel it too, this endless dive?
Losing ourselves, barely alive
Spellbound, I'm falling down
Wrapped in a charm that I can't disavow
You draw me in, I'm a monster you see in
Caught in the web that you spin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm spellbound
In your hands, the threads unwind
Twisted fate, no peace of mind
Eyes like fire, a burning sea
You've cast your spell and I'm not free
Like a phantom wrapped around my veins
You call my name and I feel the chains
Bound to you with invisible ties
Every answer's wrapped in lies
Do you feel it? Do this endless dive
Losing ourselves, barely alive
Spellbound, I'm falling down
Wrapped in a charm that I can't disavow
You draw me in, I'm a hundred years in
Caught in the web that you've been
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm spellbound
And in this dance of push and pull
You take me high, then leave me dull
A puppet strung on your desires
A game of gods, a kiss of fires
Spellbound, I'm falling down
Wrapped in a charm that I can't disavow
You draw me in, I'm under your skin
Caught in the web that you've been
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm spellbound
Spellbound, your grip's so tight
Lost in your magic, lost in your light
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, spellbound
Never to be found, spellbound
