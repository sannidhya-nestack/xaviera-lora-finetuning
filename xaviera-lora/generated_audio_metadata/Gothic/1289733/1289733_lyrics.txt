September, you and you
It's all that I can do
I give you everything you want
But you, you want more
This is war
This is war, this is all we ever do
Every time we cry, we cried with dry eyes
Silence from my phone
A death sent by the rage
Do I stop a brand new birth
Or do I, do I turn the page
This is war, this is war
This is everything to you
Everyone's alone and I, I am too
Sitting here with you
Is everything to me
I give you everything I have
But you want more
This is war
This is your
This is wrong
This is all we ever do
Every time we cry we cry with dry eyes
This is wrong
This is war
This is everything to you
Everyone's alone and I am too
This is war
