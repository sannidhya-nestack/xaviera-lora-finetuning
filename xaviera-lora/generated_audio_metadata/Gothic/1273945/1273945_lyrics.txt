New shows of face I know
Eyes that hide the underdone
Drowning in nuance or song
Seeds of sins begin to grow
Diving sins are calling me
Chains that won't set me free
Walking lines I cannot see
Seven sins surrounding me
Neither shows a face unknown
Eyes that hide the undertow
Drowning in the warmth I've sworn
Seeds of sins begin to grow
Seven sins are calling me
Chains that hold set me free
Walking lines I cannot see
Seven sins surrounding me
Lead is taking hold of me
Gluttony's my company
Sloth has kept me on the ground
Pride's the tallest wall around
Seven sins a colony
Chains that won't set me free
Walking lines I cannot see
Seven sins surrounding me
Envy paints the world in green
Wrath ignites the in between
Lust is singing out its plea
Can't escape what's deep in me
Seven sins are calling me
Chase them all, set me free
Walking lines I cannot see
Seven sins surrounding me
Can't foam, rose and green
Rapid nights, the in between
Bosses in and out, it's flea
Can't escape what's deep in me
