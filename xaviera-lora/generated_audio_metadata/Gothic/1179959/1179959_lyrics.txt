Smoked a cigarette to pass the time away
The same one I swore would be my last just yesterday
And I still think about the good times that we shared
And how suddenly it vanished in thin air
You can look all you want
And then one day you'll find
That what you're searching for's gone and left you behind
Nothing I wouldn't do
Just to hear you say
Oh that you changed your mind
And in time you will learn to ive
I've learned how seldom chances come
How could I know?
You were the one
But don't you see that it's so wrong
To just let go
Love so strong, so strong, yeah
Then we drifted apart
Didn't notice a change
One match lit a fire
Sent our world up in flames
Can we make a new start
Can we turn a new page
Or say you changed your mind
Turn back time instead
But you can't ive
If the time has come to say our last goodbye
Then at last I turn away
Knowing I tried
You could look all you want
And then one day you'll find
That what you're searching for's gonna left you behind
Nothing I wouldn't give
Just to hear you say
Oh that you'd change your mind
And if I could turn back
Well then maybe I'd turn back time
To when I could sit right next to you
When you'd tell me you were mine
And together we'd say
Forever we'd live
Then you would tell me you'll ive
