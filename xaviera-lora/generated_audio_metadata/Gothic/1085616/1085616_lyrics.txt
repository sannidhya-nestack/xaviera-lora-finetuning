So you think you're radical
So you think you know it all
Do you live life on the edge
That your conscience never rests
You're just playing a game
With those foolish words that swell me name
But you'll only know
A life that's been from the television studio
I'm Chad Revolution
Well I ain't superbia
I'm Chad Revolution
Said I know it's God and fences
I'm Chad Revolution
Smashing all his televisions
I'm Chad Revolution
So you always want and ride
The infinity crane
'Cause your blood pressure goes high
And you're gonna play real life
You just born all day and there's got to be another way
Never do anything
You're too busy chokin' at the windmills in your mind
On track revolution
Riding for Birmingham
On track revolution
Touchin' all the stars in front of us
On track revolution
Smashin' all the televisions
On track revolution
You're an armchair warrior
Magnetium weight class war
Sit at home and smash mistakes
Man imagine barricades
No one's listening just follow words no one believes in
Don't you realise you're a Walter Milly for domestic paranoid
I'm Jack Revolution
Riding to Columbia
I'm Jack Revolution
Catching all the sky defenses
I'm Jack Revolution
Smashing all the televisions
I'm Jack Revolution
I'm Jack Revolution
I'm Jack Revolution
I'm Jack Revolution
Armchair revolution
Armchair revolution
Armchair revolution
Tear down those garden fences
Smash in those televisions
Tear down those garden fences
Smash in those televisions
