Past the iron gate we glide
Pedal, sleep yet never die
Cemetery perfume drip so slow
Breathing stories stones don't know
When the city turns away
Marble saints will let us stay
Hand in hand with history
We are the furloughed
Midnight picnic, hearts collide
Sit forever on the other side
Stone companions guide our sway
Memory sings and love decay
Pour the wine on quiet ground
Laughing soft without a sound
Raven circle overhead
Blessing vows we never said
When the city turns away
Marble saints will let us stay
Hand in hand with history
We unfurl the revelry
Midnight picnic, hearts collide
Sitting forever on the other side
Stone companions guide our sway
Memory sings and love decay
Granite tongues recite our tune
Spirits hum a distant rune
Time may wander, we remain
Carved together, marked by name
Midnight picnic, hearts collide
Set forever on the other side
Stone companions guide our sway
Memory sings and won't decay
Midnight picnic, hearts collide
Sit forever on the other side
Stone companions guide our sway
Memory sings and won't decay
