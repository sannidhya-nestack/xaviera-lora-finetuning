I think the world's looking for spirituality, spirituality, spirituality
(Eighty feet in diameter, thousand and seventy miles high)
(Circling the earth at sixty-eight thousand miles an hour)
We get our kicks marching, people falling in line
You feel the pigs, and make'em sick
Amazing what they're calling, a simple way of life
They're looking face down at you, their radio shutdown surge
You're crazy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Shut down, stay down)
(Eureka, Eureka)
Stop all your preaching cause your government has failed
Those hypocrites, they make us sick
One will lead another and the rest will watch in time
Your radio shutdown heard you
Our generation says fuck you
Your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down, your radio sits down
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
The US government is playing the role of God
Don't want to be called a sex minority
We won't break or fade away
We're not a category in your ecological file
Not looking face down at you
Your radio shutdown says
Your radio sits down, sits down, your radio sits down
