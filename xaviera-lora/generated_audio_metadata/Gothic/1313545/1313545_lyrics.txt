Crystal breath slipping slow
Whispers chilling as they go
Silver threads wrap around
In silence now I'm tightly bound
Mirror glass reflections break
Frozen tears, emotions ache
Velvet numbness, lost control
The pulse concealed within my soul
Silent wires, hidden fear
Echoes whisper, drawing near
Ice in my veins, it pulls me under
Cold sensations, quiet thunder
Frozen heartbeat, trapped within
Ice in my veins, it starts again
Silent rooms, distant calls
Faded secrets, empty halls
Whispered lies, tangled blue
Dreaming softly, losing you
Breathing frost, eyes unclear
Touch so distant yet so near
Feelings fade, heart unsure
Wrapped in cold without a cure
Ice in my veins, I'm sinking deep
Promises freeze that I can't keep
Ice in my veins, it pulls me under
Cold sensations, quiet thunder
Frozen heartbeat, trapped within
Ice in my veins, it starts again
Ice in my veins, now all that's left
Feelings locked, emotions left
Fading softly, heart undone
Ice in my veins, forever numb
