Silent whispers trace my skin
Echoes breathing softly in
Twisted wire, silver breath
Dancing closer, sweet as death
Eyes so cold, a whispered threat
Promises we both et
Silver lining fades to black
Lost my mind not coming back
Words dissolve I'm pulled below
Your gravity won't let me go
Feel your midnight pulse
Pulling me on the slow
Haunted rhythms taking hold
Sinking deeper, letting go
Midnight pulse, I'm caught within
Secrets spin beneath my skin
Fragile dreams lost to the chill
Frozen moments standing still
Whispers break but I can't hear
Drowning softly disappear
Breathless touch, illusion sweet
Cold surrender, incomplete
Eyes wide shut, I'm hypnotized
Bound forever by your lies
Midnight pulse, I feel the call
Caught in whispers, bound to fall
I've got your midnight pulse
Pulling deeper out of sight
Losing feeling, lost the fight
Wholesome spoken, taking hold
Secrets whispered, dark and bold
Midnight pulse, I sink again
Wrapped in whispers without end
Silence binds me, pulls me near
Fading, softly disappear
