Awaken, now do your time, silently
Destroy your own world, be safe
Cross the sphere of critical mass
Just for night
It's getting alright
A post-traumatic state of being blamed
Exploding your torment into devastation
More violent than a thousand slugs
Fletching off the touch of death
The eternity
Is in your hands
Destroy you
Destroy your world
Psychiatric ball of fire
Soaring across a wave
Single point in time
Thousands free to rise
But a mix of waves
Screaming waves of all our cause
Will these mountains rest
Must it get to blame?
Set to reduce to my life
Black magic
Silently pervading
Deathly radiation
Body smashed and broken
Chaos is drowning
Destroyer
Destroyer of worlds
Destroyer
Destroyer of worlds
I'm the bloody blazing rebel
Oh yes, all cause with me
I'm the bloody blazing rebel
Oh yes, all cause with me
I'm the bloody blazing rebel
Oh yes, all cause with me
I'm the bloody blazing rebel
Oh yes, all cause with me
Only a soft corner for me
Only a soft corner for me
I'm not putting a page in Rambo
Only a soft corner for me
Only a soft corner for me
