Walking paths I've walked before
Faces seem familiar here
Echoes linger from the core
Bringing forth the old and near
Struggles, turnings, unrepeating
Caught within this endless queue
Every moment I'm retrieved
Lost inside this breach of through
Walking paths I've walked before
Faces seem familiar here
Echoes linger from the core
Bringing forth the old, the near
Circles turning, time repeating
Caught within this endless view
Every moment I'm retreating
Lost inside this déjà vu
Footsteps fall in patterns known
Words are said I've heard them speak
Feeling trapped yet all alone
Chasing answers that I see
Circles turn in time
Endless you
Every moment I'm retreating
Lost inside this deja vu
Been away to break the cycle
Find a path that's truly you
Like the chains that hold me
I don't reach beyond this faded view
Circles turning time repeating
Caught within this endless view
Every moment I'm retreating
Lost inside this déjà vu
Is there a way to break the cycle?
Find a path that's truly new
Break the chains that hold me idle
Reach beyond this faded hue
Circles turning, time repeating
Caught within this endless view
Every moment I'm retreating
Lost inside this déjà vu
