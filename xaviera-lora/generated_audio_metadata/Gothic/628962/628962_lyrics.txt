She was a Philadelphia filter queen
She thinks she's so obscure
She wasn't really part of the hipster scene
She was Olympia Gold
All light and sweet
She was a floorboard particle beam suppressor
She was the archetype of a PES dispenser
Her predecessor with the trigger friendly tongue
She walks the ready
Brilliant ideas
Is that what you want
Brilliant ideas
She stacked her scaffolds while she sought the scale
She had a velvet spine
She does a good job of underthinking when she's overwritten line after line
There is an authored silence in a glass half-meter
She played her rest while her wrists were moving
She's on a monophonic and she's not pretending
And she's not pretending
And she's not pretending
It was a fraudulent pop-up bible
That held up a kitchen table
Rusty orange salad hands
Brilliant ideas
Say what you want
Brilliant ideas
Say what you want
Brilliant ideas
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Brilliant ideas
Tell me what you want
Brilliant ideas
Tell me what you want
