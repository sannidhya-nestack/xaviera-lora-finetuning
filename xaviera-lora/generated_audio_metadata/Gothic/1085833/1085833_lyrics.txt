Father, pastor, show me love
Even though I'm the devil's son
I've been dragged up, so why drag you down?
I reached from afar and it's you I've sold
In my rising soul, I bear no shame
I did not come for you
I brought you salvation
And I gave you my heart
You gave me your anger
And tore me apart
Next you will still apologize
I'll paint your sins
I'll be your greatest mistake
If you were here then I'll destroy you myself
I'll make you feel the way that I feel myself
Father, pastor, show me love, even though I'm the devil's son
Father, father, show me love, even though I'm the bastard's son
The last thing you left was a curse through your name
Fishing low for bucks while you're greeted with fame
