I told you that nothing ever changed
I'm drowning inside of this
Story's still fiction
It's all an illusion
World waits around you
Inside you
It all slips away
And even your screams are foreign things to just a whisper
And somehow your dreams come crashing down as they collide
And this is what she wants and asks for it
Not know if it's worth a try
And watch yourself come crumbling down
Drink your scars for newfound hope
And you can play the victim
I'm not afraid, there's always something out there for me
I can't believe it, feel this way, I'm sorry
I'm not afraid, there's always something out there for me
I can't believe it, feel this way, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
And I don't think there's always something out there for me
I can't believe you'd feel this way
I'm sorry
