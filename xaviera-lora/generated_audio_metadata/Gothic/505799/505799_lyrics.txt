Nearly catch me now I'm breaking off
I lost my medicine I'm nearly stuffed
A broken balance to wrestle this little weight
It is something scary or slightly ordinary
One chance to light the flames that still surround us
Within our lives, broken down inside
We bring this all upon us
We will tear this open from the inside
et these problems and try to get some sleep
And loosen up and lie there
And spread yourself so thin
And hold it back and reach inside
And try to fake a smile
On this January night
Turn out your lights
So can you take us back to where we used to be?
It's overcompensating but never ordinary
Late to bed, sleep all day
Wake up laughing still alone
You wrap yourself in cellophane
Splashing show become too old
On this January night (on this January night)
So Haley catch me now I'm breaking up
I lost my medicine I'm nearly stuck
A broken balance to our soulless little way
