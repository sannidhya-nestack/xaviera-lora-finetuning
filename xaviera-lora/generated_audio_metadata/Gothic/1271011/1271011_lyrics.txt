Midnight echoes on an empty street
Shadows fall where our hearts would meet
Memories of you linger in the rain
Haunted by the ghost of us again
In the convoy, I'm calling your name
Empty it echoes, nothing feels the same
Every moment slips away
Since you left, I'm lost in grey
In the cold void
I'm calling your name
Empty and echoes
Nothing feels the same
Every moment slips away
Since you left, I'm lost in grey
Moonlight glimmers on the broken glass
Fragments of a love that couldn't last
Winds of change have blown you far
Now I'm wishing on a falling star
In the convoy, I'm calling your name
Empty and echoes, nothing feels the same
Every moment, splits away
Since you left, I'm lost in grey
In the cold void, I'm calling your name
MD and echoes, nothing feels the same
Every moment slips away
Since you left, I'm lost in grey
Time stands still but you move on
Facing nights that last too long
In my dreams you still appear but morning light makes you disappear
In the cold void I'm calling your name
Empty and echoes nothing feels the same
Every moment slips away
Since you left I'm lost in grey
In the cold void, I'm calling your name
Empty it echoes, nothing feels the same
Every moment slips away
Since you left, I'm lost in grey
Dawn arrives, the shadows fade
But the memories always stay
