It hurt so bad when you left me
It turned my insides out
The searing pain
My bed self blamed
The shrieks I'm screaming out
I cannot soothe
There is no balm to wrestle calm these nerves
I'm drained
I'm spent
No energy
I've lost all my reserves
House of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth, I'll burn you down
Bury your crown, my children I bequeath
This house of shame is a place of pain
With shadows all around
This recalcitrant vagabond of loveless silent sounds
House of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth, I'll burn you down
Bury your crown, my children I bequeath
This house of shame is a place of pain
With shadows all around
This recalcitrant vagabond of loveless silent sounds
Ruthless Adobe whose dreams corrode don't know how to behave
It's raining scented rusty bands beneath those I ave
The hollowness, the shallowness, the ones that cannot breathe
The growing mountain tragedy of Satan's last reprieve
House of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth
I'll burn you down, bury your crown
My children I bequeath
This house of shame, this place of pain
With shadows all around
This freak house of trend
Vagabond of loveless silent sound
This house of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth
I'll burn you down, bury your crown
My children I bequeath
This house of shame, this place of pain
With shadows all around
This freak house of trend
Vagabond of loveless silent sound
Shriek oh shriek
The fathoms reap
Decaying mortal flesh
Thunderbolts of normal folks
Who testify in jest
Who testify in jest
House of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth, I'll burn you down
Bear your crown, my children I bequeath
This house of shame, this place of pain
With shadows all around, this recalcitrant
Vagabond of loveless silent sounds
House of shame, it's you I blame
I kick you in the teeth, I'll burn you down
Bear your crown, my children I bequeath
This house of shame, this place of pain
With shadows all around, this recalcitrant
Vagabond of loveless silent sounds
