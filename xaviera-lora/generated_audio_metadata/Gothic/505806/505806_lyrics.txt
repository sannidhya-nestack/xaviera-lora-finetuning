She's up all night
Fireworks racing through your mind
Building pyramids of expectations
Broken bones, manipulation
Thoughts in your head running over and over
Rerun on your only channel
You've got one chance to break free
Say this again, words without meaning
This one goes to the girl in the back with her hair pulled tight
Blood on her smile, kill him to just fit in
This one goes to the boy with the bottle
Drowning her out, afraid of tomorrow
Lonely as the bar hookings
Got no place to go, he's still out on his own
Don't give him hope, don't let him stop breathing
You've got a crush, got a bomb with the fusing
The mental itch from the burn, now so healing
You want it, you'll take it, it's all that you know
It's only a matter of time
You twist words and they're meaning (come on now, come on)
So quick and deceiving
Running in circles but longing for change
Don't know where we are but you know I can take
This one goes to the girl in the back with her hair pulled tight
Blood on her smile, killing to just fit in
This one goes to the boy with the bottle
Drowning her out, afraid of tomorrow
Lonely as the ball hookings
Got no place to go, he's still out on his own
Don't give up hope, don't let him stop breathing
Don't let him stop breathing
If you're gonna stay with me we're gonna talk this over
Gonna bend tonight I can wait forever you know
If you're gonna stay with me we're gonna talk this over
Gonna bend tonight I can wait forever you know
You know we're gonna talk this over
This one goes to the girl in the back with her hair pulled tight
Blood on her smile can't aim to just fit in
This one goes to the boy with the bottle
Drowning around afraid of tomorrow
Lonely as the ball of kings
He got no place to go he's still out on his own
Don't give up hope don't let him stop breathing
