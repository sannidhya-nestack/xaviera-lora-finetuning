Born from the head of the original source
Bunch of a fire that blasts off above force
Don't worry, I can't let this explode
In the time of the law, let's give to lay down the law
Let's take our souls from ourselves
That it might give us a chance to prevail
Then I will
Take a note of fail and listen until we tell
On iron steeds they ride
Cold force by the storm
Horizons meets the tide
Blowing riders horns of war
Show us the way
Open our eyes to
Light of the day
I don't do as I do
You don't have to say
I don't do as I do
You don't have to say
