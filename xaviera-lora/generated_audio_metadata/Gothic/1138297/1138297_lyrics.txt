I'll get you when the sun dies
Gravity takes hold
A tyrant she inhaled out of space
Electromagnetic
This region needs space time
Nothing escapes the paralyzing grasp
Time engines collide
Chaos from the other side
A trip with me is never safe
The beast awaken
And my crap burns and shaken
Nevermore will I et the day
The universe scream
Stars can't do me
The day we fell
The darkest space hell
Darkest space hell
Darkest space hell
Darkest space hell
Crossing the boundary to event horizon
Unknown what lies beyond here
Not sure who'll return, will we ever learn
What became of the disappeared
Dimensions collide
Chaos on the other side
A trip with me is never safe
The beast awaken
And my cracked virgin shaken
Nevermore will I et the tame
The universe scream
Stars came to me
But then we fell
Darkness makes hell
Darkness makes hell
Darkness makes hell
Darkness makes hell
Dimensions collide
Chaos from the other side
A trip with me is never safe
Beast awakened
My craft burnt and shaken
Nevermore will I et the day
That you never screamed
Stars came to me
The day we fell
In darkened space hell
Darkened space hell
Darkened space hell
Dark is special
