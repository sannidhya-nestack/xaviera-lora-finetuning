Watch your back, watch your back, hippie scum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, hippie scum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, hippie scrum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, hippie scrub you're under attack
What we hate is what you are
Middle class kids without a past
Think it's cool to be a bum
We hate you hippie scum
Watch your back, watch your back
Hippie scum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
Hippie scum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
Hippie scum you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
Hippie scum you're under attack
Peace and love has gone away
Smoking weed as I did stay
Sheltered like with no clue
Face to face with a crew
Watch your back, watch your back
The police come, you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
The police come, you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
The police come, you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back
The police come, you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, if things come you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, if things come you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, if things come you're under attack
Watch your back, watch your back, if things come you're under attack
