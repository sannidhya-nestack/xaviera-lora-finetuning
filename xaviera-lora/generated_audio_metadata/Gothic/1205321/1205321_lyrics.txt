The hour is half past ten as I lay trapped in my head
Break your chains come with me run away from this place
A shiver runs down your spine
A twitch starts in your eyes
Come away from this place
Leave it all behind
Won't you come on away with me
Click ease and count to three
The hour is half past three
We walked all day it seems
Do you think they notice me
Are they headed this way
You hear it creep closer and louder
That sound that you dread
And set the scene and notice me
Hopping dead in this way
Won't you come and escape with me
Clicking your Zank out the three
It's been three days and we still can't hope to break ourselves free
The longer that we hold on, the more determined they seem
You start to feel the sweat drifting down
It's burning your eyes
As I clean up myself
Swap the sins, I'm out of time
Won't you come run away with me
ive, you said, "Can't the three"
