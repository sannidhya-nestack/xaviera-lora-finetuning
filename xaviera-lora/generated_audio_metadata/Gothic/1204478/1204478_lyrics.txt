She begs the question, "Have you seen this man?"
The one, the material soldier
Renowned, gone away with me, but
She lays the question, "Have you got a plan?"
You are a etful thinker
You're wrong, such a sir is Wendell Dale
I know you have what, what you want from me
My electric slide, don't get under my skin
I know you have needs
With real desires
You can stay all night
Nothing comes for free
She begs the question
Have you pissed the man?
The one, the material soldier
The one with the nameless faces
She raised the question
Do you stand a chance?
You are the etful thinker
You roam such a circus when you're down
I know you have wants
What you want from me
My electric slide
Don't get under my skin
I know you have needs with real desires
You can stay all night nothing comes for free
She raised the question, have you got a plan?
You are the etful thinker
You wrote such a circus wonder down
I know you have what, what you want from me
My electric slide, don't get under my skin
I know you have needs
With real desires
You can stay all night
Nothing comes for free
She begs the question
Have you seen this man?
The one, the material soldier
Renown gone away with evil
She raised the question
Have you got a plan?
You are the etful thinker
You're wrong such a sir is Wendadale
