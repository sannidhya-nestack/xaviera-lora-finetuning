I woke up six feet underground
No angels sing, no trumpet sound
But my phone buzzes near my skull
A text from hell, ain't missed me at all
My coffin has wifi, full bar reception
Streaming regrets in high def perfection
I scroll through the afterlife, born out of my bones
Posting selfies from beneath the stones
Yeah, my coffin's lit, the signal's strong
But damn, he turned it and it feels too long
This man from ghosts I barely knew
Click here for souls they're haunting you
And grandma like my last dodgy
Though she's been gone since'93
My coffin has wifi
Dead but connected
Every app knows I've been resurrected
No peace, no sleep, just memes and groans
And sponsored ads for funeral homes
I DM'd death just to say hi
Let me unraid that Reaper guy
Welcome to the eternal plan
You've unlocked the Premium afterlife
Upgrade your tomb for only 9 .99 a month
My coffin has wifi, I can't log out
No more prayers, just push notifications
And doubt I thought death would be silent, cold and free
But it's just one big eternal beat
Yeah I'm stuck in the cloud beneath the tree
