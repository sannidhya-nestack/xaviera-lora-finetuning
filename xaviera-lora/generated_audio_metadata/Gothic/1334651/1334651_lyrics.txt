I met him in a graveyard bar
He said, "You're sweet," I said, "How far?"
He kissed me hard behind the hearse
Now his molars are a jingle in my purse
Teeth in my purse
And hearts on my shelf
I chew on regrets just to punish myself
Lipstick like blood
And heels like a curse
Don't flirt with the girl who keeps teeth in her purse
He called me crazy, I said true
Then pulled out tooth number twenty-two
I keep them all like trophies, one
Alphabetized now, isn't that fun?
Teeth in my purse and hearts on my shelf
I bite through lies with a grin full of stealth
Lipstick like blood and heels like a curse
I wake when I zip up the teeth in my purse
Incisors for charm
Canines pain
Molars for secrets I cannot explain
A wisdom tooth that wasn't yours
But thanks for the ride and the screaming indoors
Fighting like doors
Teeth in my purse
And you were the last
Your crown was gold but the shine didn't last
Lipstick like blood
And love that's perverse
I'm walking the line
With your teeth in my purse
