Sit down and learn
You sit with me and tell me your fears
And tell me everything
We got to raise, we got to raise these walls
Come back to me, come back to me and roll your eyes
Come back to me, come back to me and roll your eyes
Build your walls around yourself
Build your walls around yourself
Build your walls around yourself
Build your walls around yourself
Take your time to let it all slide
Take your pride and let it all slide
Take your time and let it die
And build your walls
