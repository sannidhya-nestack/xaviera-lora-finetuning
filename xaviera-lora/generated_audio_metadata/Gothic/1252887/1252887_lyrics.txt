Walk into the ancient past
Bring back ghosts and loneliness
Memories that still persist
In the noise of salt and love
In the misses only they know
Searching for shadow play
On the songs of yesterday
Every line a twisted room
Of secrets in the room
Through the leaves a sighing breeze
Tales of mourning under the trees
Silent fingers shadows cast
Walk through the ages past
We find ghosts in the mist
Melodies that still persist
Hear their voices soft and low
In the mists there's only rain, no
Warming pills in every glass
Grapes and sun, the seasons pass
Raisin' toast to those who came
That's my mom without a name
Angels in the twilight air
Wanderers just so lonely
Human presence called the fear
In the fields ever clear
Great white thoughts in the mist
Never leave us to persist
Hear the noises of their love
If the message only they know
As the harvest fades to go
In our hearts a story is told
In the place we hold them dear
