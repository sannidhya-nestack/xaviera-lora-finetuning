Turns out you learned a lot, it's just that most of it was wrong
Turns out you pulled it off, but now you're putting it back on
Turns out your scary neighbor's actually a really sweet guy
Turns out there really is heaven, just no one goes there when they die, die, die
I just can't, can't keep up, keep up, I can't keep it all together
I don't know which way I'm headed, I can't make out what you're saying
I just can't, can't, I just can't
It ain't easy being evil when the whole world's gone to hell
It's a struggle breaking even when you got nothing to sell
I've been working on my problems, I've been hanging out in bars
I've been doing the la la la la la but then it always goes too far
I just can't keep up, keep up, I can't keep it all together
I don't know which way I'm heading, I can't make out what you're saying
I just can't, can't, I just can't
I just can't, can't keep up, keep up, I can't keep it all together
I don't know which way I'm heading, I can't make out what he is saying
I just can't, can't, I just can't keep up
Yeah, I just can't, can't, I just can't keep up
Yeah, I just can't, can't ,I just can't keep up
