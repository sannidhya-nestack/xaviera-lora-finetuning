Only words are all you say
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
Come and say it's down to yourself
Try to get rid of all your ignorance, try it
I just don't make some sense
Kill in time, I know past tense
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
Come and sit down with yourself
Try to get rid of all your ignorance
Not a soul would ever expect
Not a lamp would ever collect
Paper lines and burning of sweat
