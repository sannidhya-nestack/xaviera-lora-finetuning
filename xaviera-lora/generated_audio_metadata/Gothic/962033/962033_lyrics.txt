In the middle of the night when you were feeling no talk for hours on end
Talking on the telephone to the smallest hours
Till we never turned up more than a faction vulgar
And me I was getting laid
Still this is what you call love
So this is what you call love
I went looking for you, you don't know me anymore
I was hesitating, I heard it all before we could be two strangers
How they never spoke before still the tables will turn
And you left me all alone
Still this is what you call love
Still this is what you call love
So this is what you call love
You've been looking for vibes when there's a me in your eyes
Talks of jealous rumors, you discuss the lies you lie
I have nothing to say to the voices in your head
I don't have a problem, but there's something says you do
Still misses what you call love
And this is what you call love
And this is what you call love
