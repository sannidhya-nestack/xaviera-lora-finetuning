And I'm today
Living in sorrow
Every day
No tomorrow
Tell me what you think won't make you feel alright
Devils are blue cigarettes you can light
And I'm today
Living in sorrow
Everyday
No tomorrow
Tell me what you think won't make you feel alright
Devils of the cigarettes you can't light
Where it go
Where it go
End up today
Living in sorrow
Everyday
No tomorrow
Tell me what you think
Won't make you feel alright
Devils off the cigarettes you can't light
Let it go
Let it go
And not today
Leaving in sorrow
Every day, no tomorrow
Tell me what you think won't make you feel alright
Devils of the cigarettes you can light
And I'm still living in sorrow
Every day, no tomorrow
Tell me what you think won't make you feel alright
Devils outlaw cigarettes you can't light
And that's the day
Living in sorrow
Everyday
No tomorrow
Tell me what you think won't make you feel alright
The apples of the cigarettes you can light
We're gay
