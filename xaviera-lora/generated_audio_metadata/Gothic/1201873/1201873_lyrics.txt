When you're a guest, what do you bring
To a vampire wedding
Maybe a human sacrifice
Or will a pint of blood suffice
I brought a pint, they cut me some slack
The bride and groom both wore black
The weirdest wedding you've never seen
They took their vows on Halloween
We like the night, we want a real moon tan
You keep the sun, we want a real moon tan
We like the night, we want a real moon tan
You keep the sun
We want a real moon tan
Moon tan
Moon tan
Real moon tan
