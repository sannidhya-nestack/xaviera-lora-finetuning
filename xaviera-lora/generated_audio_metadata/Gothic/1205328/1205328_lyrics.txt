When the dust becomes night and ambitions turn sublime
Your desires are right this way
Let me look in your eyes, let me open your mind
You know I'll find a way to give you what you need
I know what you're like, you have exquisite taste
Open up to me and explore your mind
You'll never feel the same, open to me
Break the chains off slowly
Now it's just right
Break the chains off slowly
Open to me
You open up completely
You take my breath away
I want to know your beauty
I hope you're here to stay
I want your world in my hand
I want to feel your light
Now let me light your darkness
I know you've got my flame
Break the chains all slowly
Now it's just right
Break the chains all slowly
Open to me
