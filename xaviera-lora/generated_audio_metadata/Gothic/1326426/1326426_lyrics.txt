Ink black roses line a frozen hall
Silent portraits where our secrets crawl
You trace equations on a fractured pain
Translating sorrow into lucid gain
Broken clocks mutter truth in code
Every tick a tale we still owe
Close your eyes, feel the cold reply
Some vibes whisper louder than a cry
Hold the tremor, count to four
Pulse in tandem, soul to core
Breathe the hush'til senses blur
Turn the page and let it churn
Call my name when silence sings
Feel the pull of hidden strings
Shadowcraft our promise clings
Side by side we e the rings
Midnight ink stains a trembling note
Mapping borders where the doubters gloat
Shards of faith fit like gears in steam
Clockwork proof that we still dream
Fault line kisses spark a quiet flare
Turning caution into rebel prayer
If the daybreak tears our shield apart
We'll rewrite fate with steeled glass art
Hold the void and brave its stare
Truth lives fierce in wounded air
Link your scars to mine in grace
Shadowcraft the chosen place
Call my name when silence sings
Feel the pull of hidden strings
Shadowcraft our promise clings
Side by side we e the ring
Face side by side we fought for years
Call my name when silence sings
Feel the pull of hidden strings
Shadowcraft, a promise clings
Side by side we e the rings
