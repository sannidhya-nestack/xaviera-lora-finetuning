What I build my life upon determines life or death
What I hold in my heart will I regret
I cannot see anything
I want to know what you have for me
In the moment when your mercy covers me
No longer blind, now I can see
I cannot see anything
I want to know what you have for me
In my final hour I want to know for sure
Will heaven be my home or hell's eternal judgement
I cannot see anything
I want to know what you have for me
I cannot see anything
I want to see what you have for me
