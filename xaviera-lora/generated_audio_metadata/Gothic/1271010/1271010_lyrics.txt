From the shadows of the deep blue sea
Whispers crawl inside of me
Echoes from the stars above
Calling out to Eldritch love
For whom I move from the blue trees
Beneath the waves, or so it seems
Lost in madness, can't break through
The ancient one is calling you
In the shadows of the deeper sea
Whispers crawl inside of me
Echoes from the stars above
Calling out your eldritch love
From the remover to the trees
Beneath the waves of solid seas
Lost in madness can't break through
The ancient one is calling you
Through hardened weathered stone
Voices chanting monotone
Through the veil of secrets lie
Waking terror in the sky
From the remoulding of brutal dreams
Beneath the waves of soaring seas
The lost and madness can't break through
The ancient world is calling you
Stars align, the end's begun
Embracing darkness, we've become one
Sanity slips, the shadows sway
In his presence, we obey
Unless some fate in silence falls
We'll be bound within his thralls
Cause a line, the end's begun
Embracing darkness, we become one
Sanity slips, the shadows sway
In his presence, we obey
When the sun fades and silence falls
We'll be bound within his thralls
