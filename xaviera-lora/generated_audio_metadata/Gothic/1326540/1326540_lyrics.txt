Whispers of silk and shadows weave
Threads of midnight we dare to believe
Spinning in leather wrapped in grace
A world untamed we find our place
We are the canvas dark and bold
A story that's waiting to be told
We're in the silence owning the night
In the darkest corner we find the light
Laced in shadow, dressed to kill
We paint our faces, bent to will
Fashion's calling, it's a fight
We're the creatures of the night
Whispered secrets can't be tamed
We wear our scars, we claim our name
The fashion speaks in whispers loud
Sewn from the stars we wear the crowd
Sculpting dreams in a fractured haze
The world's our run, we set the pace
We are the canvas, dark and bold
A story that's waiting to be told
We're in silence, owning the night
In the darkest corner we find the light
Laced in shadow, dressed to kill
We paint our faces bent to will
Fashion's calling, it's a fight
We're the creatures of the night
Whispered secrets can't be tamed
We wear our scars, we claim our name
In the moon's reflection we're reborn
Not a ghost but a legacy sworn
We walk the edge of style and grace
The night's our home we find our place
Laced in shadow, dressed to kill
We paint our faces bent to will
Fashion's calling, it's a fight
We're the creatures of the night
Whispered secrets can't be tamed
We wear our scars, we claim our name
Laced in shadow
We wear our scars, we claim our name
