Will I still have faith in all your lifeblood?
Survive in silence, empty of tears?
Will I still die there?
Survive in silence, your new weapons now?
Each one of you
And I will prevail
I'll be your future struggle
There's no mercy with you
For predators like me
That's why you should be free of your fucking mind
That's why Venice is the place to breathe
My world, baby, it is a gift for your fight
Baby, what it will have
I will prevail, I'm the answer just try to pass, no mercy when we meet, I'm predicting you are prey
Hand-heeled by acid leaking
Broken water plank
Time, while it still is still
This old stranger fears no
What will I bring this peace?
But I still have faith in all your lifeblood
Surviving silence will be a kiss
But I still can't help surviving silence
You're the purpose now, it's what you've earned
I will prevail, I'll get through this struggle
There's no mercy with you, for predators like me
That's why I see your fucking eyes, that's why I can't even understand just how quick
My whole fucking game is a joke, it's all your fault, right? We've been fucked, we've been fucked up
You can't run that quick
