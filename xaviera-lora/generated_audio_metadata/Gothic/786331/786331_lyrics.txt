It's only just begun, let me tell you now
Our plans have come undone, let me tell you now
There's nowhere left to run, let me show you how
This world is crumbling down, let me tell you now
That we cannot atone, let me tell you now
You reap what you have sown, let me tell you now
That you are all alone, let me tell you now
This world is coming down, let me tell you why
That we will not condone, let me tell you why
That we must not pass on, let me tell you now
How everything is wrong, let me tell you now
This world is coming down, let me
Let me tell you now, our enemies have won
Let me tell you now, our world is coming down
Let me tell you how, we're caught up in the sun
Let me be the one, to stand for everyone
Let me be the one
Let me tell you now, this world is coming down
It's only just begun, let me tell you now
Our plans have come undone, let me tell you now
There's nowhere left to run, let me show you how
This world is coming down, let me tell you now
That we cannot atone, let me tell you now
This world is coming down, let me tell you why
That we were not good enough
Let me tell you why
That we must not be so
Let me tell you now
How everything is wrong
Let me tell you now
This world is coming down
Let me tell you now
Our enemies have won
Let me tell you now
Our world is coming down
Let me tell you how
Above and the sun
Let me be the one
The step for everyone
Let me be the one
Help me, somebody help me
Somebody help me, somebody help me
Let me tell you how this world is coming down
Let me tell you how this world is coming down
You better listen'cause this world is coming down
You know how it's done
