Is this a game you play
Divide and conquer
I know I'm not alone
Your filth is washed away
You seek to suppress the masses
You need complete control
Your ego wants satisfaction
Like children, stun it and grow
Your path will lead us to ashes
As all hate does to the soul
I've seen success in your actions
You're nothing short of Uber-naked
You better get your facts straight
Your ship is sinking
I thought it wasn't so
Your filth is washed away
You really thought I would stay
Trust me it's better this way
I know world knows you're wrong
Insanity runs astray
With every word that you say
I know world knows you're wrong
Is this a game you play
Divide and conquer
I know I'm not alone
Your filth is washed away
You seek to suppress the masses
You need complete control
Your ego wants satisfaction
Like children started in growth
Your path will lead us to ashes
As all hate does to the soul
I've seen success in your actions
You're nothing short of Uber-ing
You better get your facts straight
Your ship is sinking
I thought it wasn't so
Your filth is washed away
You really thought I would stay
Trust me it's better this way
I know the world knows you're wrong
Insanity runs astray
With every word that you say
I know the world knows you're wrong
