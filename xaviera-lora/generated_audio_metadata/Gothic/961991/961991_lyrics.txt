Feather in my bowler hat
Walking sticks and baseball bat
Long eyelash and linen white
Boots and braces we're alright
No more scumbags on the street
Taking over, no retreat
Going through the town at night
Might get in an ego fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Ultra, ultra violence in my mind
Ultra, ultra violence in my mind
Ultraviolence, ultraviolence in my mind, in my mind
Living in a, living in a, living in a clockwork time
They open up my eyes
Then watch a film about our time
They try to brainwash me
Then all cure they set me free
Can't take me for being a fool
My little doogies are still cruel
Going through the town at night
Like getting an evil vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
Ultra ultra violence in my mind
Ultra ultra violence in my mind
Ultraviolence, ultraviolence in my mind, in my mind
Living in a, living in a, living in a corporate time
No more scumbags on the street
Taking over, no retreat
Going through the town at night
Like getting an evil fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Ultra, ultra violence in my mind
Ultra, ultra violence in my mind
Ultraviolence, ultraviolence in my mind, in my mind
Living in a, living in a, living in a clockwork time
Time, time, time, time, time, time
