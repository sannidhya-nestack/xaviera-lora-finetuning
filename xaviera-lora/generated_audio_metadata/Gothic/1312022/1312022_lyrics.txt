Alone is the hero in a world full of lies
Smoke in the mirrors and the sword in the spire
But gone are the days of black magic, my love, our shield
The castles have long been abandoned and dead
Destroyed by the hopes and the folly of men
Yes, gone are those old days of glory, my love, our shield
Only love can see you through
Child is born and sent off with a kiss
Long is his road that bends in the abyss
Lost in the maze he will wander my lover's shield
So take off the helmet that digs in your neck
It just weighs you down but it doesn't protect
Look up at the stars and don't waver my love, a shield
Only love can see you through
Only love can see you through
Well if I could give you wings I know you'd learn to fly
Like Raven sings from its perch in the sky
Though I can't be everything, I know I'll always try
My white angel came from the moment you arrived
Only love can see you through
A child is born and sent off with a kiss
Long is his road that bends in the abyss
Lost in the maze he will wander my lover's shields
Only love can see you through
So take off the helmet that digs in your neck
It just weighs you down but it doesn't protect
Look up at the stars they don't waver my love a shield (I wish my love can see you through)
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Only love can see you through
