She has a taste for men
She wants to lick me up
I taste like devil hair
Night is young with the world's desires
Won't you come with me
You let her in without a care in the world
But she haven't seen
Black hair, cherry lips, she'll sweep you off your feet
She takes hold of your darkest desires, it's time to feed
Will I ever be ready?
Will I ever be ready?
Will I ever be ready?
She needs a pick me up
She has a taste for man
She needs a cheer me up
I'm just a hitch in her plan
That is young and yours to hold, open up to me
She likes the taste of pain but you'll never see
You start to drown in her eyes, your legs give away
She holds a key, it bears your favorite prayer
Will I ever be ready?
Will I ever be ready?
Will I ever be ready?
She wants to eat me up
She has a taste for men
She wants to lick me up
I taste like devil hair
Will I ever be ready
Will I ever be ready?
Will I ever be ready?
