I wait, you speak
You lie, you cheat, I won't, I can't, I know
I hate
I need to move the reading
I need to move the pleasing
I need to move the reading
I need to move the pleasing
I feel I'm over reading
I want the good in the bad
I feel I'm over pleasing
I slam my head into the wall
I feel I'm over reaching
I'm stuck right in the sand
I know I must be dreaming
I feel it's real close till I fall
Away, you speak
You lie, you cheat
I won't remove the reading
I can't remove the pleasing
I know
I hate to move the pleasing
I feel I'm over reading
I want the good in the bad
I feel I'm over pleasing
I slam my head into the wall
I feel I'm over reaching
I'm stuck right down the sin
I know I must be dreaming
I feel it's real close till I fall
I feel I'm over reading
The good and the bad
I feel I'm over pleasing
I slam my head into the wall
I feel I'm over reaching
I'm stuck right in the sand
I know I must be dreaming
I feel it's real close till I fall
I feel I'm over reading
I feel I'm over pleasing
I feel I'm overreaching
I know I must be dreaming
I feel it's real close'til I fall
