River on the bridge, skyline in the distance
Kitten in black and coyotes moving towards us
I said, "Lord, please save us"
He handed a holy note up
The bus then came to get us
And drove out to the airport
It's so surreal
It's so surreal
Such a sense of relief
Staring out at the runway
Thinking we'll be free
Maybe we'll soon be free
You were under the bridge
The skyline in the distance
How it's turning black
I've been moving in the darkness
In the darkness
Such a sense of relief
Such a sense of relief
So surreal, so surreal, so surreal, surreal
So surreal, so surreal, so surreal, so surreal, so surreal
So surreal, so surreal, so surreal
