In a night where my laughter dies
A grin emerges painted light
My eyes ablaze with wild delight
This harlequin steps into the night
A dance of chaos steps untamed
A world unraveled and unreclaimed
I'm just a face, I mock my crown
I'm the real king in Mondo Town
What's that from?
Turn it upside down
Have a smoke with the Joker
Offer your past to the smoker
The odds cascade from tattered sleep
Illusions spun and meant to be
Behind the mask of a shattered soul
A fractured mind in dark control
Got the trembles at my game
A flickering flame that none can tame
I thrive when order comes undone
A duel begun, I've always won
Watch that fro
Turn it upside down
Have a smoke, I'm in the Joker
Puff it up, pass to the smoker
Echoes of a distant jest
Let's put your sanity to the test
A carnival of broken dreams
Nothing's ever as it quite seems
Yet in my chaos truth resides
A mirror where my madness hides
The world reflects in distorted ways
My last at that forever place
Stages set, the curtains part
A final act to touch the heart
The Joker smiles, my purpose clear
To live the madness, come join me here
Watch that throw
Turn it upside down
Have a smoke with the Joker
Puff puff pass it to the Joker
Puff puff pass it to the Joker
Puff puff passing through the Joker
The stage is set, the curtains part
A final act, touch the heart
The Joker smiles, my purpose clear
To live the madness, come join me here
What's that frown?
Turn it upside down
What's that frown?
Turn it upside down
Have a smoke with the Joker
Puff puff pass it to the Joker
Puff puff pass it to the Joker
