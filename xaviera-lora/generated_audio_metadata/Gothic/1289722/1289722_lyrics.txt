A sick young man, I'm the fire in his soul
I'll be the maker, submerge him in the hole
I'll be a beast, tough devil and dazzler
Come on guys, say shit, take off the mask of
Why don't you take off, break off, take off the mask of
Your heart is bursting, chest of indict
Million stars in the cracks of their black
Swallowing the sight, there's no need to abstain
Engrafted in fairy light, evil and pain
There's no need to abstain
No need to abstain
Slain by the buffet, murdered by the feast
Wallowing in the fat, the door and the case
Ambrosia and twinkle, honey and brine
A barbarous banquet of gula and wine
Slain by the buffet, murdered by the feast
Wallowing in the fat, the door and the case
Ambrosia and twinkle, honey and brine
A barbarous banquet of gula and wine
