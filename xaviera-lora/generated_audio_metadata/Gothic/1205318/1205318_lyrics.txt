You don't need to be alone, you don't need to be alone
The world's just the way it is
The black sheep
The world just the way it is, the facts just don't mean a thing (right)
The chains you get free let your mind get numb while the world keeps turning on
Just a little bit
Break the chains and get free
Let your mind get numb
While the world keeps turning on
The world's just a way it is
Relax just a little bit
Break the chains and get free
Let your mind get numb
While the world keeps turning on
The world's just the way it is
Relax just a little bit
Break the chains of your free electromagnet
Know while the world keeps turning on
The world's just the way it is
But that's just the way it is
Break the chains and get free
Let your mind get numb
While the world keeps turning on
The world's just the way it is
But that's just the way it is
Break the chains and get free
Let your mind get numb
While the world keeps turning on
The world's just the way it is
Relax just a little bit
Break the chains and get free
Let your mind get numb while the world keeps turning on
