Drifting through a haze of purple light
Where silhouettes dance in coded delight
I chase reflections on the midnight wall
Longing to hear that distant call
Oh, I'm burning for your voice tonight
Like a thunder echo in the empty sky
Melodies swirl and electrify
Yearning this electric twilight
Signals flicker on a silver rope
Sparks ignite where old desires explode
I lose my sense in digital dill dreams
Captured by fate's uncharted schemes
Oh, I'm burning for your voice tonight
Like a thunder echo in the empty sky
Melodies swirl and electrify
Yearning this electric twilight
High above the spinning satellite
I hear your name in frequencies so bright
Tuned into your code I can't deny
Our stories scrawled across the night
I feel you pulling me closer
A burst of color I can't fight
I feel you pulling me closer
In this current of lunar bliss I reach for you through cosmic mist
Your echo lives in every line And I'll keep searching'til I find
Your voice in the electric twilight
