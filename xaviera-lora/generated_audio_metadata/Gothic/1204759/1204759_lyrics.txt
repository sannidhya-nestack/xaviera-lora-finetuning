You know you're not the only one that's ever had to feel this way
You know you're not the only one that's tried to pluck away the pain
Now won't you come and take my hand and let me guide you to the light
The time is now, the war is won, it's time for you to end this fire
I really want you to know
You're not the only one
I really hope that it's time
It's up to you to end this fight
I really want you to know
You're not the only one
I really hope that it's time
It's time for you to end this fight
You know you're not the only one that's had to struggle to keep clean
You know you're not the only one to know what addiction means
Now won't you come and take my hand and let me guide you to the light
The time is now, the war is won, it's time for you to end this fire
I really want you to know
You're not the only one
I really hope that it's time
It's time for you to end this fight
I really want you to know
You're not the only one
I really hope that it's time
It's up you to end this fight
You know you're not the only one
I really want you to know
You know you're not the only one
You're not the only one
You know you're not the only one
I really hope that it's time
You know you're not the only one
It's all for you in this spot
You know you're not the only one
You know you're not the only one
