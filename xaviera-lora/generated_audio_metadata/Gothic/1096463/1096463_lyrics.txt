Time has gone so fast, it's wasted
Time has gone so fast, it's wasted on the dumb
School kids have some shit, but what gets you?
School kids have some shit, but what gets you, it's despair
Sun goes down again, sun again, sun goes down again, sun again, again, again
Time is going so fast, it's wasted
Time is going so fast, it's wasted
It's been a while since you've been home
Can't you see your dead eyes?
It's time that you step out
In his eyes
Still he looks down at me
In his eyes
Still he looks down at me
