Crawling up and down your spine
Cold sweat dripping behind
There's a shadow spying on us
An ancient enemy
A rage of her kiss
A breeze of her tears
A creature with cold lips
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In a hypnotic dream of a wild beast's sin
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In a fever dream, in a fever dream
Her arrival was so smooth, another day of duty
The sweet death breath in the gloom fades away
She's cold, pale and beauty
She can hold a man taken by his hand
In a pneumatic dream of a wild beast's sin
She can hold a man taken by his hand
In a fever dream, in a fever dream
You bite me with your kisses
I tricked you with my show
It never felt right
It never felt right
Neither fast or slow
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In the nautic dream of a wild busin
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In the fever dream, in the fever dream
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In a nautic dream of a wild beast sin
She can hold a man, take him by his hand
In a fever dream, in a fever dream
