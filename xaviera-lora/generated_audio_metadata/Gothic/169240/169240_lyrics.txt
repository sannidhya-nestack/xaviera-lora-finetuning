Thirteen weeks in dreamland
Fourteen nights in hell
Fifteen days of dreaming
Sixteen nights as well
Seventeen hours of anger
Eighteen for our planned
Nineteen days of choking you
Thirteen weeks in dreamland
I know your darkest dreams
I taste your misery
I'm the girl that you fear
The cybernetic queer
Fine fine fine my little baby gotta take me as I am
Cry, cry, cry, you little baby
You're the version who said maybe
Will you say it again?
I fell asleep on a bed of nails
Tossed in a turn as my flesh grew still
In a thirty day show in a one night stand
Thirteen weeks in dreamland
I know your darkest dreams
I taste your misery
I'm the girl with the beard, the cybernetic queer
With the girls you fear, cybernetic queers
If there's one thing I hate it's when some self-righteous bible-thumping religious freak tries to shove their mixed up, hypocritical, badly interpreted ideas down my throat
On the other hand nothing makes me laugh more than when I meet some spell casting fantasy world living satanic fool that believes they are more in control of their life I pray to some beast that lives in a hole that we call hell
Cause when it really comes down to it all you've got is you
Instead of believing in some guy in the sky why don't you believe in yourself
You might just make more of a difference that way
Thirteen weeks in dreamland
Thirteen weeks in dreamland
Thirteen weeks in dreamland
I'm a girl that's in for you
