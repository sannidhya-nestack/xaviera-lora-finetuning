Angel eyes
Mesmerize
Oceans rise
Never lie
I let the rhythm overwhelm you
No, I did
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
I heard it
In each of my days
I still remember
Still remember
Your lips
Crazy, my love
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
No, did it
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
To balance it
Let me see you
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
