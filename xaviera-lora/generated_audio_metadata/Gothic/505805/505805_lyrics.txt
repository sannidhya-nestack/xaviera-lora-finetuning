I think we're really gonna fake it this time
Over dice and we try on everything
This bitter taste, these broken dreams and your rapid fear
We can't go on for far too long
These days I'm leaving without you
Stuck on sad songs
Won't just move on
These days I'm leaving without you
There's never really been someone strong enough
To take this long way (this long way)
And if you are the one
Then tell me why the sun doesn't shine in your eyes
I rip my heart back into my throat
Center the disease in the hopes that I'll choke
It's eating into me like the phone in your side
Building up the storms in the white of your eyes
We can't go on for said too long
These days I'm leaving without you
Stop your sad songs
What gems who want these days to leave it without you
There's never anybody strong enough
To take the long way (the long way)
And if you are the one
Then tell me why the sun doesn't shine in your eyes
And we can lie awake if we want to
Or lie if it just says so
And we can lie awake if we want to
Coolest days, I don't mix tape
The Cleveland sun, the interstate
The open road, the northern lights
And you were there right by my side
