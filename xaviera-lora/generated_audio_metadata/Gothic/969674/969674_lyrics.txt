Standing in the hall, at the foot of the stairs
I see your face, you're hiding there
You look shy, what have you done?
Have you really killed someone?
Fall
Sitting in your cell
Down the corridor
I see your face
You look forlorn
Do you know why
Your friend is dead
It should have stayed
Inside your head
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lying in your bed, in a mental home
No one can help, you're on your own
You killed someone, and that's not good
Were you really misunderstood?
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
