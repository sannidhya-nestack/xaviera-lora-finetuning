This is where my love runs out
That no one really cares about
Too many laws and satellites
The loads they've kicked off for the fight
For the country, for the war
For our Queen and for them all
I'd rather stay out all night
Than hang around with no satellites
Than hang around with no satellites
Hang around with no satellites
It's a tale for the unexpected
You're gonna be late like your guest just met you
For being up to no good
They only trust the ones that they love
It's frustrating, it's too late
The soul is clay, stop, not your mate
I'd rather stay at home tonight
Than hang around with no satellites
Then hang around with those satellites
Hang around with those satellites
Oh yeah, and then we looked, and we looked, and we didn't know where to go
We just followed everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone else in the crowd
And then we looked, and we looked, and we didn't know where to go
We just followed everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone
So I seem to preach the peace
A common riot on the common street
We love the roads but we hate the hood
For private land and for private school
It's better basics to the start
You'll never have a peace of heart
So rather stay out all night
Than hang around with our satellites
Then I got around with all satellites
I got around with all satellites
Oh yeah, and then we lost, and we lost, and we didn't know where to go
We just followed everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone else in the crowd
And then we lost, and we lost, and we didn't know where to go
We just followed everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone else in the crowd
Oh, everyone else in the crowd
We just follow everyone else in the crowd
Oh everyone else in the crowd
Oh everyone else in the crowd
We just follow everyone else in the crowd
Oh everyone else in the crowd
Oh everyone
This is where my love runs out
That no one really cares about
Too many laws and satellites
Loads of kids up for the fight
For their country, for their war
For their queen, for them all
I'd rather stay at home tonight
Than hang around without satellites
