She dreamed of candy olive trees
Her ghost harmonics made him bleed
He wept and talked of going home
A loving word and then he's gone
Our life's a fairy tale on fire
Why can't we fly like everyone
You kiss the ground I walk on but
I don't deserve your gentle touch
My love is like a blood red porn
We're lost in rain and fog again
Where white cats hide beneath the cars
And taxis speed past like blue stars
Our lives a fairy tale on fire
Why can't we fly like everyone
You kiss the ground I walk on but
I don't deserve your gentle touch
I swear that I was shivering
You stole my heart, you stole my skin
But the listings we claimed made us
Forsaken lovers out of touch
Our lives a fairy tale on fire
Why can't we fly like everyone
She dreamed of candy olive trees
Her ghost harmonics made him bleed
He wept and talked of going home
A laughing waterman he's gone
Our life's a fairy tale on fire
Why can't we fly like everyone?
You kiss the ground I walk on but
I don't deserve your gentle touch
