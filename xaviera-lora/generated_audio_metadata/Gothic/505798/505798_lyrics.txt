Seven stories high is where they brought you
To the window where they dropped you
The falling out, the looking glass, the leap of faith
If you believe in what you cannot see
Or touch you're made to think
That all is right but that never stops humanity
And I'll stop waiting around
And I'll stop waiting around
For love to rise and bring us through these lonely nights
I know all too well
I know how this is
Buried on the inside of my heart
There is nothing few nor far between us
The nightmares that this brings us
The woven lies won't peel away
But men will die, it's the age old foolproof way to lead
In fear they'll turn to sheep when all is right
But that never stopped humanity
Your conquest built on passion
Always blind faith, just a fashion
A world not coming back
Now stop waiting around
Now stop waiting around
For love to rise and bring us through these lonely nights
I know all too well
I know how this ends
Buried on the inside of my heart
Buried on the inside of my heart
I know how this ends
I know all too well
I know how this ends
I know all too well
And I know
There is nothing few nor far between us
There is nothing few nor far between us
There is nothing few nor far away
And I'll stop waiting around
For love to rise and bring us through these lonely nights
To conquest the world's passion
Or is blind faith just a fashion?
Awaiting our young lives
A world not coming back
