Listen closely, hold your kids tight
Creature is me, he walks in and out
His eyes are moving, his gaze is seething
Creature is wrong, but all life has meaning
Time to be quiet, he's getting closer
Creature is me, this isn't over
If there's one thing that I do know
That I have found hope, I'm a rival of
Creature is coming for you
If only you could swim and have a fly
Creature is coming for us all
And there are worse ways to die
Creature is coming for you
The doubts linger, that's when angels fall
Pre-cut, it's covered for us all
There are worse ways to die
The time has come now
Have you been good?
Creature's waiting
And I've been so disturbed
His fingers bending
His reach is nearing
Creature is wrong
But all I've had is meaning
What do we do now?
We're barely breathing
Creature's everywhere
There's no escaping
If there's one thing
That I do know that I have found home
I've arrived alone
Creatures coming for you
If only you could swim somehow to fly
Creatures coming for us all
There are worse ways to die
What do we do now?
We're barely breathing
The creature's everywhere
There's no escaping
If there's one thing
That I do know
And I have found out
I'm where I belong
The creature is coming for you
If only he swims around the flood
Creatures come for us all
There are worse ways of dying
Creatures coming for you
The doubts linger, that's when angels fall
Creatures come before us all
There are worse ways of dying
