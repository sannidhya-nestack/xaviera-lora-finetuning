We were on the floor
We were on the floor ready to play that game we made
That game of cat and mouse we play I took the bait
I felt you whisper on my face it's such a shame
We can't mix work and play
It's too late
I'm awake
It's too late
It's too late
I'm awake
It's too late
Play your games
Play your games, they're all the same
I'm not here
Pretend you don't know my name
What's that taste?
Infectious disinfectant shame
Pet parasite
Extractions, hernia, white lies
It's too late
I'm awake
It's too late
It's too late
I'm awake
It's too late
Here's the game
Here's the game I refuse to play I won't compete
Incest just clicks the elite my muse is dead
Clap your hands over your head fuck this ain't
I'm comatose bored to death
It's too late
I'm awake
It's too late, it's too late, I'm awake
It's too late, it's too late, i'm awake
It's too late
