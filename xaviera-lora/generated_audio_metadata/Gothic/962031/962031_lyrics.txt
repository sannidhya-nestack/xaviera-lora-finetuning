She keeps on telling him that she's alright, I know she's not
She found her suicide, nobody better than she ot
He found her by her bridge, her tears could make the rivers flow
She had a blister pack of photographs to end it all
And when the morning comes you'll be alright'cause they don't know
She wants a baby boy to show him in the old boom-boom
While all the old gang used to hang around and feed my stream
She's sick and tired of being an in-and-out of her routine
Although she still cries out for what she wants and what she needs
Still thinks she'll leave tonight if she don't get and she succeeds
Oh, now she still cries out for what she wants and what she needs
Oh, now she still cries out for what she wants and what she needs
Oh, now she all cries out for what she wants and what she needs
Oh, now they all cry out for what she wants and what she needs
And when the morning comes we'll be alright'cause they don't know
She wants her baby boy to show him in the old blue ball
Where all the old gang used to hang around before my dream
She's sick and tired of being alone at her lonely tomb
Her hands were photographed, her hands were put up digital
To show a tale of how she come and that she oh so bold
