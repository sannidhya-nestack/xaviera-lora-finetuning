I had a small book with coloured pages
I would ask friends, please sign it
I will keep this forever heartfelt
Thanks for me to treasure
Beyond the pages, among the faces
Signatures were almost fading
Reoccurring, the same name
Scored on the page again and again
By hook or by crook
You'll be first in my book
By hook or by crook
I found a small note beneath my pillow
Turned the lights on, tried to read it
Handwriting, it's frightening
Your name staring back at me
Inky smudges, drops of your blood
Your writing will haunt me
If I sleep, see my dreams shatter into smithereens
My heart, though I grow old
Will be first in my book
My heart, though I grow old
I have a small book with burnt pages
I won't ask friends to replace it
I've got you now, my stalker
Backing me into a corner
Feeling trapped now, I'll survive this
It's a nightmare, sealed with a kiss
Please don't stop, keep sending poison pen letters to read
By heart or by cloth, you'll be first in my thought
By heart or by cloth
