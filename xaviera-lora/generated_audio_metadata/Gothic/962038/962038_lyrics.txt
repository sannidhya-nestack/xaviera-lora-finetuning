They say that good things will come if you wait long enough
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I always knew you were going away but for good
Has been a long, long, has been a long, long
We both agreed if we met someone new then we would
I don't think we should, I don't think we should
I'm pulling petals away for the days that you're gone
I'm counting one by one, I'm counting one by one
Whoa, leave the roads alone, whoa
Whoa, leave the roads alone, whoa
Whoa, leave the roads alone, whoa
Red roses colour for blood is it love I don't know
At least I think it was, at least I think it was
I need to know if there's anything worth waiting for
I'll make you ask goodbye, I'll make you ask goodbye
Woah oh oh leave the roads alone, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh leave the roads alone, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh leave the roads alone, woah oh oh
Another night alone, now you took all my own
In the night you're always there and I'm on my knees again
What are you wanting me to do, I need to be with you
In the night we're never there and I'm on my knees again
I'm on my knees again, I'm on my knees again
Woah-oh-oh, leave the roads alone, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, leave the roads alone woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, leave the roads alone Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, leave the roads alone Leave the roads alone
