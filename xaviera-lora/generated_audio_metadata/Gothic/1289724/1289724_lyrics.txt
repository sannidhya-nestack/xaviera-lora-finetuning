The sacred possession and the crux of our lives
Obsessed with males from the quicksand of time
The special tug-of-war, the craving for flesh
The primeval instinct we have died to defend
Eternal passion that fires the heart
Volatonic waste of the soul
Our endearing society controlling the mind
An ancient desire to be fair and aligned
An ancient desire to be fair and aligned
An ancient desire to be fair and aligned
Cradles of brothel, the whole house that made
In death or bliss, shall we never be saved?
No salvation, just sorrow, the open desire
The frigid deterioration, extinguish the fire
The craving for heat, the eternal caress
A burning hell, vanished in place, sunny and dead
Vulture in a lust, a sterile soul
In latex, in leather, hell is swapping the rolls
The dark-moving mantis, the stallion at heart
The mistress and master, the kiss goes without
Shadows in the back, room paid, please take your seat
In the cult of asm, tabernacle elite
In the cult of asm, tabernacle elite
Honey!
Ah!
Sugar and fire flow
