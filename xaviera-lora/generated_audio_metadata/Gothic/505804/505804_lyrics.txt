Don't you bring that heart attack next to mine
Screaming at the top of our lungs
Looking for a way out, you turn the clock back
You point the finger but I'll trace the facts
The lovers, the enemies, lost friends and casualties
I'm losing my mind
Left to the right
Darling this is the end
Now I've caught you in a whisper with those bedroom eyes
You can be happy on this fence
But I can't live like this no more
I can't live like this no more
We've drawn out the battle lines
You rest a shot but I'll take my time
It's every man for himself
Put your arms around me
You'll feel my heartbeat
Captain 13, unlucky empty
The lovers, the enemies
Lost friends and casualties
I'm losing my mind
Left
To the right
Darling this is the end
Now I've caught you in a whisper with those bedroom eyes
You can be happy I'm this face
But I can't live like this no more
I can't live like this no more
Can we start over here as two strangers in the crowd
Leave it to fate for once or just look the other way
We will never be the same
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Now I've caught you in a whisper with those bedroom eyes
You could be happy on this earth
But I can't live like this no more
I can't live like this no more
