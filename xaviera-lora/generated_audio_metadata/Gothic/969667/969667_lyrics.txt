A lonely man by the fireside
Sitting alone, this is where he hides
Collecting papers for weeks on end
A torn up bible, his only friend
Traces of stains in the carpet tread
A worn weathered face shows fear of dread
Collecting coins and stamping books
Preserving history with dirty looks
Hidden away in the house in the town
Ignoring the door when folks call round
The silence shattered by crackling flames
Darkened smoke where the fumes inhaled
A cloud'round his head made from nicotine
A tint in the chair where his body's been
Hell's fire
Hell's fire
A lonely man by the fireside
Sitting alone, this is where he hides
Collecting papers for weeks on end
A torn up bible, his only friend
Traces of stains in the carpet tread
A wall where the face shows fear of dread
Collecting coins and stamps in books
Preserving history with dirty looks
Hidden away in the house in the town
Ignoring the door when folks call round
The silence shattered by crackling flames
Darked in smoke were the views in hail
A cloud'round his head made from nicotine
And it's in the chair where his body's been
Hellfire
Hellfire
