Musik machen, kein Krieg, es ist das, was wir verdienen
She's a vampire queen of the underworld land
Explore her sinister twisted mind
What are you enlisted in, Brittany?
Flaws of the Nether?
Loops and chains with the Nether?
I've fallen in love with your Hannah Moresco
I've fallen in love with your Hannah Moresco
Johanna Moresco, a beauty with a bite
Her fashion is a manifesto written by the devil
I've never seen such an amazing socialite
But the lights are flashing red'cause the danger's on the level
That's just a pretty face, she plays a wicked fiddle
Dancing on the strings, boy, get you in the middle
Oh man, she got a wicked plan
Buckle up, throw a ride, welcome to the other side
I've fallen in love with Johanna Moresco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna-Moresco
Ooh, ah, ah, ah
She's a vampire queen of the underworld scene
I'm a king
All I need is a fix, all the magical tricks
All I'm gonna do is give it back to your love
You do it like nobody does, and all I really need is a fix
Your style, your profile, ain't nothing like them other chicks
I've fallen in love with your Hannah Moresco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna-Moresco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna-Moresco
I've fallen in love with your Hanna-Moresco
