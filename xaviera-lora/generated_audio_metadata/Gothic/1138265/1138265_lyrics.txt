(Burps)
Cold as stone
In this my escape
If we all breathe
The echo before it rains
Life secrets splinter
Decay unfold
Fill with me before I'm gone
No matter what the future holds
It must be this dying
A torture of rebirth
Gasping for star faces with eternal
Reflections of dead world trauma
I am the mirror
A reflection never seen
The grief of easy life to see
Consumed by matter
Trapped into being
An hourglass
I never wanted
The sense of time
To pass me by
Buried me before I'm born
I still breathe
In this womb of the life that is dying
The torsos are breathing
Gasping for salvation's breath
Eternal in the place of God
You are no trouble
I am the mirror
A reflection never seen
The reformation lies between sides
And I'm decomposing
So pick up my decay
With a day every day
Every step is like decomposing
When she goes into the grave
So bury me
Before I'm born
And don't give me up
So bury me before I'm gone and don't take me up
Bury me before I'm gone
Where we meet, we're far apart
(So let's hurry up)
Where we made before I'm born
Do not take me out after I've tried
Where we made before I'm born
Do not take me out after I've tried
