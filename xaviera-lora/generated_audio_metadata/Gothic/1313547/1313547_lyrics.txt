Lost in whispers, velvet screams
Pull me deeper through twisted dreams
Breathing smoke, I taste the night
Cloaked in velvet, lost in flight
In silent hope
I wander cold, tangled truths no one has told
Hidden scars beneath my skin
In darkness secrets wearing thin
Hear your voice, distant call
Watch the velvet curtains fall
Wrapped inside a black velvet dream
Nothing's ever as it seems
Heartbeat racing caught between
Fading whispers and silent screams
Blood red roses softly die
Feel the chill my lullaby
Mirror fractured memories blurred
Lost in feelings left unheard
Smoke and mirrors blind my eyes
Bound by threads of whispered lies
Drowning slowly, sinking deep in velvet dreams forever sleep
Wrapped inside a black velvet dream
Holding tight I can't breathe deep
Wrapped inside a black velvet dream
Nothing's ever as it seems
Heartbeat racing, cough it sweet
Fading whispers and silent screams
Black velvet dream, hold me tight
Sinking softly out of sight
Endless darkness comforts me
In velvet sleep I cease to be
