She walks, then she falls to the floor
Her eyes fade into the dark
Her tongue is slipping away
It doesn't matter if you're real big or small
The blue death is coming for us all
Do I even care what you have to say?
You're gonna end up a noose that any day
Where's the knowledge that you claim to see?
I guess the enlightenment comes next week
It doesn't matter if you're real big or small
The blue death is coming for us all
She walks, then she falls to the floor
Her eyes fade into the dark
Her tongue is slipping away
It doesn't matter if you're real big or small
The blue death is coming for us all
Do I even care what you have to say
You're gonna end up a noose at any day
But where's the knowledge that you claim to see?
I guess the enlightenment comes next week
It doesn't matter if you're real big or small
The blue death is coming for us all
