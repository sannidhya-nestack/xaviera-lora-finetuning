I own this ocean, it is my abyss
Could I really be the queen of the sea?
My strength is strong and my heart is pure
I love your face, your tangled purple hair
Twists through my fingers
My hold will tighten if you resist my charms
I'm dragging you deeper into my arms
Your skin is so soft, cold and bare
Your flesh will be broken with blood to spare
My hold will tighten if you resist my charms
I'm dragging you deeper into my arms
Your skin is so soft, cold and bare
Your flesh will be broken with blood to spare
You're my angel, my savior, my vampire desire
I'll release a new life within you
You'll be strong and relish your revenge
I will bring you new friends
I will devour you with every bite
You belong now in the dead of night
Don't struggle my sweet thing, water turns red
I've had hundreds of mermaids, who've turned my head
You're the chosen one now, page was right to choose you
A new chapter is calling, a crystal clear truth
Don't struggle, my sweet thing
Water turns red
I've had hundreds of mermaids
Who've turned my head
You're the chosen one now
Hate was right, did she lose you?
A new chapter is calling
A crystal clear truth
I will devour you with every bite
You belong now in the dead of night
