My head's in arrest, I have to let go
Before I dry up inside
Reflect the rules I have to choose
I play the game that never ends
Your life is misdirection, reflect the information
Take back the information, information, information
You're on your way, you're going nowhere
But you can stay here anyway, you're on your way
On your way, you're going nowhere
But you can look back again, you live
You know, you can take back everything I give
My lips are black, they're closing in
There's no way out through their skin
Open up your eyes, refract the sins in this dead light
Conditioning, your life is my direction
Reflect the information, take back the information
Information, information
You're on your way, you're going nowhere
But you can't stay here anyway, you're
On your way
You're going nowhere
But you can look back again
You live
You learn
You can take back everything they give
Your life is misdirection
Reflect the information
Take back the information
Information, information
You're on your way
You're going nowhere
But you can stay here anyway
You're on your way
You're going nowhere
And look back again
