Cracks appear beneath my skin
Quiet rooms I'm breathing in
Mirror shards reflect a truth
Haunted by my faded youth
Velvet echoes break apart
Cold vibrations in my heart
Taste of metal, silent lips
Trapped within your fingertips
Sinking deeper, poles unknown
Your shadow chills me to the bone
I've got glass heart syndrome
Feel it fracture, feel alone
Splinters linger, can't let go
My reflection hurts me so
Glass heart syndrome, crystal clear
Break the silence, disappear
The whispers bleed behind closed doors
Footsteps echo through my pores
Phantom feelings, phantom pain
Frostbite whispers in my veins
Static
Hoses through my chest
Frozen breath can't find its rest
Tracing scars in crystalline
Fragile heart beats marking time
Glass heart syndrome on repeat
Every fracture, bittersweet
I've got glass heart syndrome
Feel it fracture, feel alone
Splinters linger, can't let go
My reflection hurts me so
Glass heart syndrome, crystal clear
Break the silence, pencil
Fading slow, every heartbeat letting go
Shattered pieces whisper low
Glass heart syndrome now you know
