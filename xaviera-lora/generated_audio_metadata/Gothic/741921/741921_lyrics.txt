I love you apple
I know you're cheating, what's your fault?
My solitary
It's down below your shaded warmth
You're seeing right through me
Do you know what I'm thinking of?
Is it pain, is it love that keeps us growing stronger than anyone?
Am I just an amazing freak of nature tired of going on?
I found that I am more like you
I found that I am more like you
Been a stranger for the last time in my whole being
For what are you reaching?
You're growing higher every day
Maybe forever
To take you away from us my dear
Is the steering certain?
I know you will be staying right here
Is it pain, is it love that keeps us growing stronger than anyone?
Am I just that amazing freak of nature, tired of going on?
I found that I am more like you
I found that I am more like you
Been a stranger for the last time in my home
Is it pain, is it love that keeps us growing stronger than anyone?
Am I just an amazing freak of nature tired of going on?
I found that I am more like you
I found that I am more like you
Than a stranger for the last time in my movie
Be nice, be nice
