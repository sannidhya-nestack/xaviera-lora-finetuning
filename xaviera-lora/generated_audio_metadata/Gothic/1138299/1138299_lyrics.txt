Ruin of every man
Soldier of regret
Takes care of no man
Existence of death
They'll have you running for your life
Fighting from devils in the night
Takes one to know one
I've seen it all
From riches to rags
Scared when they fall
They'll have you running for your life
Hiding from devils in the night
They'll have you running for your life
Fighting from devil'til the night
For a word, still an answer
No love lost here
They say they'll take everything
No sympathy, just fear
They'll have you running for your life
Hiding from devils in the night
They'll have you running for your life
Hiding from devils in the night
