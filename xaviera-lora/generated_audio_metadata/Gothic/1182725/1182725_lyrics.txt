Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll do bad, catchin' girls, exes breakin' on their toes
Breakin' bushes, raisin' skids, get your glass and play some wheels
Keepin' guard at night, ain't no rest, keepin' on this cash, no more frisks
Just keep lookin' at faces, no need to know all these faces
I can feel you back in the game
Don't you feel the station waiting to arrive?
You don't look like you should be denied today
Shadows, footsteps, no soul's guilt
Threatened by a worn out world
Storms been swaying, let me go
What we are and what we know
I feel the stiffness leaping in
Just to shout at what they're thinking
Who am I and who are you?
I step back and think about
The people you've got to obey
Can you tell us please you ready?
Who are you? What do you want?
I'll take the beating as you die
Shadows possessing us so acute
Threatened by a worn out mood
Stomps in swaying vertigo
What we are and what we know
Shadows possessing us so acute
Throttled and by air worn out, dude
Stomps been swaying, let me go
What we are and what we know
