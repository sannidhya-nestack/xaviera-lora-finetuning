(The princess I am)
A whispered hush
Glass turns slow in silken rush
Sugar melts in swirling stream
Opening an absent dream
Bitter kiss on waking tongue
Every pulse a hymn unsung
Green spell, pull me in
Let the silence start to spin
When the wormwood starts to rise
I see worlds behind your eyes
Green spell, make it stay
Turn the night to myth and play
the final drop is gone
Green spell
Carry on
Clock hands freeze above the door
Murmurs grow then fade once more
Figures dancing in the jade
Born of every sip we've made
Bitter kiss on waking tongue
Every pulse a hymn unsung
Greenspell, pull me in
Let the silence start to spin
When the wormwood starts to rise
I see worlds behind your eyes
Greenspell, make it stay
Turn the night to myth and clay
the final drop is gone
Greenspell
Drifting through a liquid maze
Faces bloomed and slipped to haze
Warm wood merged through my vein
Binding bliss to whispered pain
Green spell, pull me in
Let the silence start to spin
When the wormwood starts to rise
I see worlds behind your eyes
Green spell, make it stay
Turn the night to myth and play
the final drop is gone
Green spell
Green spell, carry on
Green spell, carry on
