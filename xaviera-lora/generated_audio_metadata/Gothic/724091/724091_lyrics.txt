Time to set sail
I've never owned a boat but I can guess how it feels
To be seconds from adventure
While I'm just stuck in this room with pen and paper
Head towards sales, I'm not one for taking chances
I can guess how it feels to be minutes from excitement
While I'm just stuck in this garden smelling flowers
Regardless of how I alleviate my time
All these thoughts that I had stuck in the back of my mind
That I've gone through it just turned the outcome a guarantee
I'm not so lucky
Success or fail, I've never had both
But I can see how it feels to acknowledge your accomplishments
While I'm still stuck in this garden smelling flowers
Regardless of how I alleviate my time
All these thoughts that I have stuck in the back of my mind
That I've gone through to gesture the outcome are guaranteed
I'm not so lucky
I've got my hands in the sand with no real option left but to smell the flowers
Got my hands in the sand with no real option left but to smell the flowers
Got my hands in the sand with no real option left but to smell the flowers
Got my hands in the sand with no real option left but to smell the flowers
Regardless of how I alleviate my time
All these thoughts that I had stuck in the back of my mind
That I've gone through to gesture the outcome I guaranteed
I'm not so lucky, I'm just stuck in this jar it's smelting flowers (I'm just stuck in this jar it's smelthing flowers) (I'm just stuck in this jar it's smelting flowers)
I'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers (I'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers)
I'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers (i'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers)
I'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers (i'm just stuck in the garden smelling flowers)
I'm just stuck in the garden
