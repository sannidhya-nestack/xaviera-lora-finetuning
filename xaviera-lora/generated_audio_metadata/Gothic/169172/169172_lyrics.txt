Dead walks and talks and breathes
But I'm not scared to die (not scared to die)
I'ma live my life in hell
Sometimes I wonder why (I wonder why)
I heard you scream
You threw it all away
You needed love like a little girl within you
You threw it all away
You gave it all away
Away
My life I offer you
As soon as the test of time (as soon as the test of time)
My pledge has proven true
And soon I'll make you mine
I heard you scream
You threw it all away (threw it all away)
You needed love like a little girl could send ya
You threw it all away
All away

Sucking their blood
Sucking their blood
Sucking their blood
It keeps me falling away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
You gave it all away
