Are you happy when I play your game?
Are you satisfied to say my name?
Baby is it true?
I'm the only one for you
I just want to make you happy
I just want to be your naughty girl
Give you something to remember
Tonight will last forever
I will make you happy
Deeper pleasures I want you to feel
Fantasies evolving to the real
And keep your eyes on me
Baby I want you to see
I just want to make you happy
I just want to be your naughty girl
Give you something to remember
Tonight will last forever
I will make you
I just want to make you happy
I just want to be your naughty girl
Give you something to remember
Tonight will last forever
I will make you
Happy
Happy
