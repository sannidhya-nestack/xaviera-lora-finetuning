Well, I don't just hunt on Halloween, I'm an all-year-round nightmare queen
Keep your pumpkin heads, I'm searching for my heart instead
A curse torn of death
The stars a legend
The moon in deceit
If I be taken to the knee and blown
I go slow, slow
From hell with a vengeance eyes
The heartless horsemen rise
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause I don't just hunt on Halloween, I'm an all-year-round nightmare creep
Keep your pumpkin heads, I'm searching for my heart instead
Hunt this horseman, hunt
Yeah
Gallop, gallop, restless knight
Pinching towards my disguise
Love hearts deep and soaked
Their pain slays my own
Hearts and thirst, wounds to fill
Imagine him with every kill
In the cheers, pray, pray
Lord, and the heartless horsemen reign
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,'cause I don't just hunt on Halloween
I'm an all-year-round nightmare queen
Keepin' clear of your pumpkin heads
I'm searchin' for my heart instead
Hunt this horseman
Hunt
In pumpkin patches you will find
He who carved this crooked smile
On his knees to be returned
The old log in Isilur
My curse lives on beyond his day
Might make the fear forever spread
I don't just hunt on Halloween
I'm an all year round nightmare queen
Keep your pumpkin heads
I'm searching for my heart instead
I don't just hunt on Halloween
I'm an all year round nightmare queen
Keep your puffed and head sat searching
For my heart and stage
