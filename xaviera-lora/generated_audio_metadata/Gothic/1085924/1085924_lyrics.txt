I'm so tired of living alone
I'm so tired of living alone
It's my chariot from Caliscro, plain and no doubt
I crank to my feels, I've got my foot to the floor
I'm easy stick, shifting, don't hate me when I piss it
The little hot riders can't keep up with me
It burns the gas when it's on my catch, but I love my car
It gets the cheeks when you're feeling sick, but I love my car
It burns the gas when it's on my catch, but I love my car
It gets the cheeks when you're feeling sick, but girls
They only don't mean
But would it be the same if I didn't have a car?
Car, car, car
I get my kicks out of driving, that ain't simplifying
But there is no one who is quicker than me
When I pop the clutch up, foot down to punch it
No one has a racktop that is faster than mine
It burns the gas, spends all my cash but I love my car
It gets the chicks, make fellas sick but I love my car
It burns the gas, spends all my cash but i love my car
It gets the chicks, make fellas sick but girls
That you're the don't mean
But would it be the same if I didn't have a car
Car, car, car
One day I took a challenge by the suit-dub screener
And there was no way he was gonna beat me
The chicks dug his mantle and I emptied out the stacker
The heat's got me and the car was killed
It burns the gas and it's all my cash but I love my car
It gets the chicks and they feel sick but I love my car
It burns the gas and it's all my cash but I love my car
It gets the chicks and they feel sick with girls
They only told me
But would it be the same if I didn't have a car?
