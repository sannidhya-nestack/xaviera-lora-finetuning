As the sun set in the south, I was caught unaware
Although I knew that the time had to come
I'd been blinding myself to it for years
As the sun sets out, time was turning at angles
I grew increasingly aware of seasons, the month and the moon and the day
As the sun set, I didn't know who to look to
With each step my love grew and pulled me with soft fingers back from the hills
As the sun set in the south, the north was warmly expanding
I dreamed and saw myself standing in ashes on mountains of madness or joy
As the sun set in the south, my memories changed color
Even the duller moments were tinted with gold and sky blue and green
As the sun set in the south, I was struck with a fever
I reviewed my behavior these last four years for apathy or doubt
As the sun set, I reexamined my options
Put myself up for adoption and crawled back into the womb
And as the sun set in the sound, I sucked it in
I sucked it in, I sucked it in
And I took a leap
Sunset sound, sunset sound, sunset
Sunset sound, sunset sound, sunset sound, sunset
