Don't know how I've got here
It must have been something I've done
No time for regrets
For the clock keeps ticking
And I must move on
Did I lose all others?
Or did I arrive on my own?
I'm dazed and confused
And my head keeps pounding
As I carry on and on
I keep on running as this monster I fear
I've never seen it, don't ask me how
I just know it is here
This nothingness deafens
It disorients norms and minds
Each color dissolves
Leaving no place to hide
I cry and the world answers with rainfall
As if it can look strange
Into my head
I don't know if it's always been this way
Growing uncertainty drives me insane
I scream
A house in silence
Around every corner I find nothing but fear
I can't recall the places I left behind
But anywhere must be better than here
If only I could find my way
If only I remember the place I've been
Studying anything without doubt is nothing but blame
In the skies in my head, in my head
In my head
As morning comes I awake soaking in sweat
Was it just a dream?
A nightmare I had
I looked around me
Really as far as I can tell
I'm back where I belong
Safely in myself
Myself
