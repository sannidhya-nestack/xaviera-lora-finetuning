I bent down on my dirty knees
Begging the lord, pray please
Save me from this misery
Gotta get my angel wings
Bent down on my dirty knees
Begging the lord pretty please
Save me from this misery
Gotta commit my angel way
I was riding with the devil in a black stretched limousine
Flying down the highway in Knoxville, Tennessee
He said, "Boy, you're going with me to the land of misery"
I've been down on my dirty knees
Begging the Lord for help, please
Been down on my dirty knees
Begging the lord, pretty please
Save me from this misery
Gotta get my angel wings
Bent down on my dirty knees
Begging the lord pretty please
Save me from this misery
I gotta get my angel wings
Bent down on my dirty knees
Begging the lord pretty please
Save me from this misery
Gotta get my angel wings
Bent down on my dirty knees
Begging the Lord, "Pretty please"
Save me from this misery
I gotta get my angel wings
I was riding with the devil in a black stretch they'd all seen
Flying down the highway and we never stopped to pee
He said, "Boy, you're coming with me to the land of misery"
Be a town on them dirty knees
Beggin' the Lord, pray, please
