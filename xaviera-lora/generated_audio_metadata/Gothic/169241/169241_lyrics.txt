What do you dream for?
You've never told me of your anger with the world
You've never told me why you dressed up like a little fucking girl
We carry on with the spread of the myth
No one gives a shit, no one gives a damn about the things that we believe or the things that we trust
It's when we're fucking down we're all gonna die
They've always told you what to say
They're always telling you to get on your knees and pray
Just like a sinner did
Live to hate, hate to live
I'm a mean motherfucker
Don't make me come and get ya
Live to hate
I ain't nothing left, I'm a, it's a packing mama but I'm really just a son of a bitch
Have you ever had one of those days that no matter where you look everything you see is completely fucked up
People living and crying and lying and dying
The hopes and dreams of all mankind
Still in the end we're just destined to die
Shit, I think we're all just trying to survive
Day to day doing the best we can with what we've got
You know that more people have been killed in the name of Christianity
Than have died from all the plagues, natural disasters, world wars or diseases like cancer and AIDS
Now that's fucked
They've always told you what to say
They're always telling you to get down on your knees and pray
Just like a finisher
Live to hate, hate to live
I'm a mean motherfucker
So ain't no coming at ya
Live to hate
Me, me, me
I'm a typical packin' mama
But I'm real innocent, I'm a big head child
It doesn't matter who you are, what you believe in or stand for
Cause in life there's only one thing that you can count on and that's yourself
If you believe in yourself then you'll be strong
If you're strong then you'll survive
And hey, that's all we're trying to do anyway
People always asking me, "Hey man, do you believe, do you believe, what do you believe in?"
Well I'll tell you what I don't believe in
That's anybody trying to tell me when, where, how I can live my life
What I can say or what I can think, fuck that
They've always told you what to say
They're always telling you to get down on your knees and pray
Just like a citizen should
Live to hate, hate to live
I'm a mean motherfucker, don't make me come and get ya
I'm a bitch so pack it mama and I never will et ya
I'm a mean motherfucker don't wait me come and get ya
I'm a bitch so pack it mama but I'm really just a son of a bitch
Yeah I'm a son of a bitch
Yeah I'm a son of a bitch
You know I'm a son of a bitch
You know I'm a son of a bitch
Son of a bitch
Bitch
