And so then we didn't deserve the truth
Felt like it was yesterday
Without a meaning, without a cause
You started to drift away
Into the deepness of your loss
Of truth
And into the red dawn
Look up to the sky when I am gone
Now will you be seeing me?
Felt like it was yesterday
You started to drift away
All true
Oh truth
And into the red dawn
Look up to the sky when I am gone
Now will you be seeing me
And still you'll believe it
Still you'll be breathing
I want you to move on
But when you are feeling you can't go on
Won't ask you to live on
Nothing to live for
Nothing to give to you, oh cruel
Why don't they fail to see the truth?
Oh, truth
If only they could stand to hear
Oh, truth
Why do they fail to see the truth of true love before we take this into you?
