Dusty records spin around
Echoes of a distant sound
Faded pictures on the wall
Memories rise and softly call
Looking back it's clear to see
Past is calling out to me
Can't mistake the way it feels
Reminiscent cuts and heals
Broken clocks and rusted chains
Footsteps on otten lanes
Faded pictures on the wall
Memories rising, softly calm
Looking back, it's clear to see
Coast is calling out to me
Can't escape the way it feels
Reminiscent cuts and heals
Broken clocks and rusted chains
Footsteps on otten lanes
Silent voices sing alone
Haunted by a familiar song
Looking back it's clear to see
Past is calling out to me
Can't escape the way it feels
Reminiscent cuts and heals
Times of faith that steals our days
Leaves us lost in endless waves
Buggy echoes never fade
Hear the silence, their replay
Looking back it's clear to see
The past is calling out to me
Can't escape the way it feels
Reminiscent cuts and heals
