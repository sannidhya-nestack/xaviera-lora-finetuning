You said you'd leave quietly if I asked you nicely
You said you wouldn't mind if I was here in town
You said we'd soon well see if there's a you and me
You said we'd go alone now hard to hold our own
While you were sleeping, I thought of leaving
I couldn't say why but I just couldn't stay right here
And now I'm standing here waiting on your last fear
From scrolling down your face onto your pillowcase
While you were sleeping, I thought of leaving
I couldn't say why, but I just couldn't stand here
Pickin' up the pieces where we left off
No, I'm still pickin' up the pieces where we left off
And yeah, I'm still pickin' up the pieces where we left off
And yeah, I'm still pickin' up the pieces where we left off last time
While you were sleeping, I thought of leaving
I couldn't say why, but I just couldn't stand here
While you were sleeping, I thought of leaving
I couldn't say why, but I just couldn't stand here
