Black and white the scenes unfold
Stories of the lost and bold
Broken dreams and cigarettes
Fading in a world of silhouettes
Through the lens we see the fall
Secrets written on the wall
In the alleys where the truth won't hide
The bitter and the sweet collide
Fill our dreams with stories we crave
Dancing on the edge between hero and knave
Fill our dreams caught in the haze
Lost in the smoke and the endless gaze
Steps that go down the hall through the haze we see it all
A crooked smile, a twisted plan, a feminine world of silhouettes
Through the lens we see the fall
Secrets written on the wall
In the alleys where the truth won't hide
The bitter and the sweet collide
Fill more dreams with stories we crave
Dancing on the edge between hero and knave
Fill more dreams caught in the haze
Lost in the smoke and the endless gaze
Footsteps echo down the hall through the haze we see all
A crooked smile, a twisted plane with infantile, but never
In the darkness deals are made
Promises that quickly fade
A loaded gun, a lover's sigh
Caught between truth and lies
Film war dreams, the stories we crave
Dancing on the edge between hero and knave
Film war dreams, caught in the haze
Lost in the smoke and the endless gaze
Steady wheels, the curtains draw
Flashing scenes of dusk and dawn
Every frame, a shattered crime
The good and bad all passing by
Film our dreams, the stories we crave
Dancing on the edge between hero and knave
Film our dreams, caught in the haze
Lost in the smoke and the endless gaze
And as the credits slowly fade
We're left with choices that we made
Film our dreams, we play the part
Caught in the shadows of the human heart
