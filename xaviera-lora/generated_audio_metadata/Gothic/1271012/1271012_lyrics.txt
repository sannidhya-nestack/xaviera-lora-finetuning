Shadows crawl across the moonlit ground
Whispers echo, there's no one around
Comatose through hollow trees
Lost inside these fading memories
In the dark I feel you near
Silent whispers in my ear
Ghosts of you won't let me go
Dancing in this midnight show
Shadows crawl across the moonlit ground
Whispers echo there's no one around
Cold wind sighs through hollow trees
Lost inside these fading memories
In the dark I feel you near
Silent whispers in my ear
Closer you won't let me go
Dancing in this midnight show
Footsteps follow down this empty road
Heart beats heavy bearing the load
Faceless fate in flickering light
Chasing phantoms in the dead of night
In the dark I feel you near
Silent whispers in my ear
Ghost of you won't let me go
Dancing in this midnight show
Time stands still as the clock strikes twelve
In these shadows I find myself
Embracing fears I've always known
In this darkness I'm not alone
In the dark I feel you near
Silent whispers in my ear
Ghost of you won't let me go
Dancing in this midnight show
Clouds fade like the rising sun
But the haunting has just begun
