I'm married to a chimp, it's not what you think
She looks more like you and me
She's got a cute face with human traits
She likes to swing from a tree
We've been on a blind date, I nearly went ape
When she walked right up to me
But I'm married to that chimp, it's not what you think
We live together happily
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
She never wears P .M .S.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, own, ow, ow
She lives on bananas
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow ,own, ow, ow
She's my salient beauty
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
I'ma do my duty
I'm married to a chimp, it's not what you think
She looks more like you and me
She's got a chimp face with human traits
She left swing from a tree
We met on a blind date, I nearly went ape
Then she walked right up to me
Better marry that shithole'cause it's not what you think
But we gonna start a family
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
She never wears P .M .S.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, own, own, own

We're a happy family
I'm living here with my chimpanzee
