I remember one day my mother said to me
She started to scream, take my hand
You better leave it alone
Hello Mother, what have you done?
Hello Mother, where have you gone?
My mother's missing from me
We search the streets
She's never messed with me
Did I do something wrong
Why did she leave us alone
Hello mother, what have you done?
Hello mother, where have you gone?
Don't worry mother, I'll be alright
I only hope you survive the night
My baby sister's with me, she is hungry
She's always questioning, where did mother go?
Did I do something wrong?
Hello mother, what have you done?
Hello mother, where have you gone?
Don't worry mother, I'll be
I only hope you survive the night
The air I start to feel
I think I'm losing time
Screams fill the air
Your mother's dead outside
Hello mother, what have you done?
Hello mother, where have you gone?
