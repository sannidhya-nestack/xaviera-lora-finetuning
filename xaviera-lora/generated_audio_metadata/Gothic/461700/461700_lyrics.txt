I know just what you need
You need someone like me
Someone who's exercise
Someone who makes you dream
Well can't you see me?
I'm looking at you
Can't you see me?
I'm doing what I do
Take my hand and hold me tight
Come with me and we'll get it over there
I'm the one, the one that you can count on, I'm the one that fulfills your needs
You're a mystery, so help me, you know what I need
A little mystery, so help me
Say one, two, buckle my shoe
Say three, four, five, six
You're my little demon love
You're my little bitch
Such a sweet little girl, I'm a nasty little boy
Have to thank your mom for my brand new toy
Big blue eyes and a tight red dress
You're the little angel and I'm such a mess
I'll always love you
Till the moon and the stars fall to the sea
I'm the one and one that you can count on
I'm the one you can pinch and beat
You're my mistress of agony
Little bit of need
A little mistress of agony
Red lights flash and the backseat crash
Petal runs through my veins
No time for suicide
There's no one left, no one to blame
I'll always love you
Till the morning the stars fall in the sea
I'm the only one that you can count on
I'm the one you need, the only thing you need
Little mistress of agony
What I need
The little mistress of agony
Yeah, what I need
The little mistress of
Little mistress
The little mistress of agony
Little mistress
Little mistress
Little mistress of, I will always love you
Till the moon and the stars are all I see
