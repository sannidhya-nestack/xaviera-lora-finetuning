We're born, we're fed, we're raised on bread
You must fit in, compete and win
There is no prize for telling lies
To fail or pass another task
To stimulate our mental state
We laugh and cry and wonder why
Our life is this, to kill or kiss
We are all slaves waiting for graves
The light and shade of this charade
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on bread
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on bread
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on bread
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on bread
The human trait, to celebrate
To show our face, to earn our place
Within ourselves, our mental hell
We laugh and cry, and wonder why
A lesson learned, some bridges burned
In war and peace, a slow release
A tortured mind is left behind
The light and shame of this charade
We're born, we're fed, we're raised on dread
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're born with it
We're raised on dread
We're raised on dread
