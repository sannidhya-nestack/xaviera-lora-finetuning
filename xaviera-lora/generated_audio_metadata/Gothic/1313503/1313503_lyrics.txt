Lights flicker softly on empty walls
Echoes of moments that no one recalls
Frost on my senses, I'm drifting
Alone (alone)
Wrapped in the hum of a broken tone (tone)
Your voice in the distance pulling me near
Threads of the past unraveling here
Faces in photos, their colors subdued
A hush in my heartbeat, thoughts left unglued
I trace your outline in the fading glow (glow)
Every breath heavier, nowhere to go (go)
Shadows in static calling my name
Haunted by whispers never the same
Shadows in static haunting my core
Holding me captive I can't ignore
I feel your spectre under my skin
Breaking the surface, the tension within
Minutes are hollow, the night's wearing thin
Stuck in a cycle, I can't seem to win
Resonant hum in the back of my mind
I'm lost in the patterns we left behind
Tangled in chords of a memory's hold
Chilled to the soul by stories untold
Shadows and static spin
Drowning to heartbreak without a sound (sound)
Shadows and static still cling to me
Shadows and static, I'm never free
