Dressed in black, the palms shine bright
I dance beneath pale daylight
The world may fall but I'll still laugh
I'll find my joy in the aftermath
The velvet cloak, the silver chains
I walk the life without pain
The smile beneath the darkest veil
In every storm I'll set my sail
They don't understand the way I see
There's beauty in the misery
I'm a happy goth living on the edge
Laughing at the void while I dance on the ledge
Find my bliss in the darkest scene
Happy goth living in between
The graveyard blooms, it calls my name
But I don't wanna play the game
In all that's grim, I'd all still lie
I find my joy in the aftermath
The velvet cloak, the silver chains
I walk through life without pain
The smile beneath the darkest veil
In every storm I set myself
They don't understand the way I see
There's beauty in the misery
I'm a happy goth living on the edge
Laughing at the void while I dance on the ledge
Find my bliss in the darkest sea
Happy goth living in between
The grey got goons, it calls my name, but I don't wanna play the game
In all that's grim, I find my peace, the weight of life becomes release
Of every tear, there's something sweet, a twisted joy beneath my feet
The world may frown, but I just smile, the happy goth, my perfect style
They don't understand the way I see
It's them and the mystery
I'm a happy goth living on the edge
Laughing at the void while I dance on the ledge
Find my bliss in the darkest sea
Happy goth living in between
The grey got black but feel the light
The contradiction burn it bright
In sorrow I can find my grace
A happy goth in every place
I'm a happy goth, living on the edge
Laughing before I pop my ass on the ledge
Thought my best in the dark is seen
Happy goth, living in between
I'm a happy goth, I'm not afraid
In every who enjoys me
A laugh I cry, my land I dream
A happy goth, forever unseen
I'm a happy goth, I'm not afraid
In every ruin, joy is made
I laugh, I cry, I live, I dream
A happy goth, forever unseen
