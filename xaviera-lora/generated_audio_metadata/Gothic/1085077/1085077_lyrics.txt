Tommy's in the street and he's giving it heaps
He's ready for the night which he'll greet with a bottle of cheap
Boggy when he's pushing it, somebody needs to cross the line
Tommy's in the bar, but he won't get far
He's tellin' all the girls how he plays guitar
He'll buy them a drink before he turns the club
And this person is eager to let's choke
Eager we go, eager we go, eager we go
Tommy's getting busy in the bathroom, surely he's pushing his girl against the wall
He'll tell her that he loves her if she gives it up, you know old Tommy was just a -<|9.60|>
Get fucked!
Tommy's in the blue and he's a state
The butcher walks over and he's throwing chips
Tommy you're a fool get outside
Oh Tommy's getting killed on the face of his mind
Tommy's in a car on his way back home
The driver thinks he's all alone
Behind the steering wheel's no sex appeal
Oh when you hear the sirens
Let it swing
Here we go
Here we go, here we go
Tommy's in a cell, he's gone from control
I guess they should've thought of finding him
Fuck head first, we're the CIO in World Summit
Get it right!
