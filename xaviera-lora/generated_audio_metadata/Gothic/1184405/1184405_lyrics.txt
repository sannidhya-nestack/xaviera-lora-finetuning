[MUSIC PLAYING]
In the shadows my mind is lost
Hoping to understand their words
But I only got one confusion, yes
It was a big lie But nobody told me the truth
My world full of hope And nobody tried
It was just an escape from here
Everything is black and full of monsters
My body's full of worms and blood
I want to get out of here
But they tell me I can't
Everything is gloomy and full of death
My body's full of worms and dirt
I want to get out of here
But they tell me I can't
Everything's mist and full of devils
My body's full of fire and dust
I want to get out of here
But they tell me I can't
(It's about the cancer)
All I want is peace of mind
But I want life and life
So I have to give the punishment
The truth will prevail
My body decayed
It's terrible every day
My mind full of trash and fake reminiscence
Was just a demon who wants grace
