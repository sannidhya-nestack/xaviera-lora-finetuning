Countdown with a twisted grin
The chaos crawls beneath the skin
No reason, no pride, just a creeping fire
A dingy bomb, a dark desire
Painted faces lost and torn
Where the lions crossed and worn
The silent scream, the bloody mark
Another tale to stain the dark
Turning the gears of the book
A poisoned pearl of the cruel and blind
Random acts of mass murder
Echoes in the dirt and grime
Random acts of mass murder
Breaking through the thin red line
Counting faces lost and torn
Where the line is crossed and worn
The silent scream, the bloody mark
Another tale to stain the dark
Turning the gears of the broken mind
A poison burrow of the cruel and blind
Random acts of mass murder
Echoes from the dirt and grime
Random acts of mass murder
Blanking through the thin red line
Random acts of mass murder, they dance into the chaos core
Random acts of mass murder, nothing less but the endless fall
In every face, the beast concealed
The fractured smile, the truth revealed
A loaded gun, a twisted stare
They play the part without a care
Lost in the blur of siren lights
A carnival of endless fights
Crimson trails on shattered ground
In the silence there's no sound
Falling through the crack of time
Human nature's vicious crime
Random acts of mass murder
Echoes in the dirt and grime
Random acts of mass murder
Breaking through the thin red line
Random acts of mass murder
They dance into the chaos call
Random acts of mass murder
Nothing less but the endless fall
No names, no faces, no alibis
Just empty stairs and severed ties
No rhyme, no reason, no grand design
Just a wreckage left behind
An empty cry, a hollow breath
Fading whispers on the edge of death
A world unhinged, a world gone mad
Bound to repeat the tale so sad
Random acts of mass murder
Echoes in the dirt and grime
Random acts of mass murder
Breaking through the thin red line
Random acts of mass murder, the answer to the chaos call
Random acts of mass murder, nothing left but the endless fall
The stage is set, the curtains fall, a twisted game that tempts us all
Random acts of human pain, will we ever break this chain
