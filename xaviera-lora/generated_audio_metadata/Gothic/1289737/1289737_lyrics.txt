Think to yourself
Still alive
Resign yourself
Resign yourself
Who is you do not like me
I can't tell because I don't need to
And something says you want your freedom
What do you want freedom from?
You're just scared and bored
Still and alone
Still and alone
You're just still and alone
Skin and bone
You're just skin and bone
Skin and bone
You're just skin and bone
Skin and bone
Drunk to skin and bone
Skin and bone
Drunk to skin and bone
Skin and bone
Skin and bone
Stand alone, you're just standing alone
