You can't hide from the shadow inside
Cuts and tears you with your shattered dreams
Egos lie in bloody stinking piles
Such a shame like a moth to the flame
Some people live in a virtual world
Begging strangers for a little love
Adoration, the drug of the new age
Such a shame, like a moth to the flame
Round and round and round you go
Oh who you love you'll never know
Life is short and death plays little games so
Round and round and round we go
Love is hard and cost us all so much
The only guarantee is buyer's remorse
The heart is a brat who always gets his way
Such a shame like a moth to the flame
Round and round and round you go
Oh who you love you'll never know
Life is short and death plays little games
So round and round and round we go
Pleasure's the beast that unleashes all the pain
The passion it feeds is never satisfied
A high price to pay for just a sugar rush
Such a shame like a moth to the flame
Round and round and round you go
Oh you love you'll never know
Life is short and death plays little games so
Round and round and round we go
Round and round and round you go
For who you love you'll never know
Life is short and death plays little games so
Round and round and round we go
