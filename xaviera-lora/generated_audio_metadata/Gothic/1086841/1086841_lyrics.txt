Sitting round the table in my brain array
Spiritual communion for all to see
Try to break through to the other side
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
Silver candlestick and flickering flame
Unleash the demon with the blade
Finger on the glass, hand on the heart
Come ye the believer, let the séance start
Séance
Séance
Séance
She'll show you images from your past
As the wind rushes in and moves the glass
You don't have records and noise avoided
So alternative you've got no choice, eh?
Burly portraits on the wall
Shining on my waist in the hall
People were never gonna miss their art
Come ye non-believers, let the day of start
Stay on, stay on, stay on
Atlantic range, melt in the air
Nobody shows up, is anyone there?
Is it planned or false? You must find out
No hesitation, no time to doubt
The club was gathered, the silence shattered
Rolling for the door,'cause it doesn't really matter
You've opened the book and you've played the game
At least it even went on air
Sayonara, sayonara, sayonara, sayonara
Silence, silence, silence
