Black satin and angel eyes
Leave me spellbound, mesmerized
Let it happen, the oceans rise
'Cause the night leaves even the moon paralyzed
If compelling is what you intend
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
There's no telling where this will end
Let the rhythm overwhelm you
Are you real? Are you real? Or a disguise?
Black satin and angel eyes
Black satin and angel eyes
I still remember, still remember your lips grazing my earlobe
At first I was a slave in your paradise (the rhythm overwhelmed you)
But the thirst I felt
You've made me realize I'm overwhelmed with you
I'm addicted, hypnotized
To black satin and angel eyes
Black satin and angel eyes
Ooh, ooh
Black satin
Let the rhythm overwhelm you, let the rhythm overwhelm you
