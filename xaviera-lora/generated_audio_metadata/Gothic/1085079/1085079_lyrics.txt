Lately I've been feeling something different about you
I started noticing all everything that you do
For the way you bite your lip
With you getting nervous
And the way you hold your hair
With you embarrassed
And the way you walk behind
That shy shoulder
But from the get go
You let go
Have it right where you want it
To the limit, baby, if I want it
You let go
You let go
I'd be right where you want it
Would have been different if I wanted
Lately I've been feeling something different about you
I've started noticing all everything that you do
From the way you always look
Into my eyes, everywhere you sometimes blush
When I'm around, everywhere you always smile for me
But from the get go
Let go, have it right where you want it
I couldn't leave it in if I wanted
Let go, let go, have it right where you want it
I couldn't leave it in if I wanted
Well lately I've been feeling something different about you
Starting noticing everything that you do
I can't go, let go
Well I'm there right where you want it
And you don't leave me then if I want it
You have it right where you want it
Do the leave it if I want it
