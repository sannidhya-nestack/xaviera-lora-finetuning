All life runs away with you, it's clear
I'll be ghosts on and on through failure
I can tell you want me now
I've seen mistakes and hard times
So close and usually
I don't have long enough
Our life runs away
Our feet goes on and on through the fear
I can tell you only now
I'm used to plates from yesterdays
I'll catch the reference
I've been here just long enough
Darkest ghosts project themselves through our vision
I aim my visions up anywhere
Eat our love from skin and amortize
Both your flesh and colour from the thing I died
Music based on yesterday
I don't quite catch the cultural reference
I've been here just long enough
To wait till the kids have their party
