Safety opening lightnings
Torches chasing shadows
And waves taking a tense breath
Daybreak ended very soon
Evening warm as windy breeze
Far and behind a cage of rain
Trail higher and feel again
Evening tread of shades
Odds and silence will be chains
Ringing out in the name
Naked, divided, silence
Naked, divided, silence
She will be blinded by another you
She will be, she will be, she will be
She will be, she will be, she will be
Naked, divided, silence
Naked, divided, silence
She will be blinded by another you
She will be, be, she will be
He should be
He should be
He should be
Frightened, lovers, thrown out
Dreaming man running dry
Back again and does
Naked indivisible bounds
She will be, she will be, she will be
Naked indivisible bounds
She will be, she will be, she will be
Two, two, two, two
Frightened lovers drowning (lovers drowning)
Dreaming men running dry
Back again and ask
Naked indivisible bones
Into each other's arms
Make it indivisible, bound
