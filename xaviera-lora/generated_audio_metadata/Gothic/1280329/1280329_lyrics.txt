In the still night, when silence speaks
I hear the deafening of the secrets that it keeps
The weight of time is pressing on my soul
Memories feel, that I can't control
Like ghosts of heroes, haunting my mind
Lost in the darkness, searching to find
Reaching out, I bet you're not there
Echoes of you are everywhere
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Faces in the crowd, all of them say
Chasing after whispers calling out your name
The emptiness inside me grows each day
Holding on to moments that fade away
Echoes of you all around in my mind
Lost in the darkness searching to find
Reaching out but you're not there
Echoes of you are everywhere
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Can you hear me calling from this endless night?
Every step I take brings me closer to the light
I'll keep on running'til I feel alive
Break these chains that hold me inside
Echoes of you are haunting my mind
Lost in the darkness, searching to find
I'm reaching out, I'll sing
All hearts in my mind
Echoes of you
Lost in the darkness
Echoes of you
Searching for finds
Echoes of you
I'm reaching out
Echoes of you
I lose and I'm afraid, afraid
When silence speaks
I find the strength breathed in
Promises I keep
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Steady on your feet
Steady
Stimulize what silence speaks
And I find strength within promises I keep
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
Echoes of you
In the still of night when silence speaks
I find the strength within promises I keep
Echoes of you, echoes of you
Echoes of you, echoes of you
