In the silent flow
Your secrets grow in the silent snow
Your secrets show
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up off the ground
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up out of the black hole
Imagination gets the best of you
Alienation makes it all come through, all come through, woo-hoo
In the silent flow, your secrets grow
In the silent snow, your secrets show
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, find the heavy loads
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Don't give in to hell
Communication
Something you won't do
Abomination
Watch, fiddle is you, fiddle is true
In the silent snow, your secrets show
In the silent snow
Your secret show in the silent snow
Your secret show in the silent snow
Your secret show in the silent snow
Your secret show in the silent snow
Your secret show
In the silent snow, you see
