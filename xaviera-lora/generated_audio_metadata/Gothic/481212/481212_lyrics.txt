Sacred love, where beauty resides
Deadliest sin, but nothing too high
Capture joy that this life will bring
Your love will bloom like roses in spring
You tell me again and again, this love
It's all we're longing to see
When I say what do you know about him?
Believe in Prince Charming
We're here to hold family passions aside
Love's meant for me like a soon-left-for-bride
Heavenly love
Lips will kiss me and say
Embrace this heart and don't go away
Beautiful deadly passions inside
Want to escape from the beauty of life
As we torment
Please let me breathe
You've only got nothing I want to see
Temperate hearts just beat with the string
Of those who deny all the lust in their veins
Taken by temptation so fly
I yield to the sin and give thanks for my hard time
You tell me I'll get it again, yes I will
But soon will I mean to say what I say?
What do you know about him leaving me?
A prince charming, beautiful, deadly, passions aside
Love's meant for me like a sinful crime, heavenly and absolute
Kiss me and say, embrace this heart and don't go away
Fears grow deadly, passions inside
Want to escape from the beauty of life
Enchanting torment, please let me breathe
You've only got nothing I want to see
All that remains of a heart filled with smiles
Seeking for love but without the same fun
Lock me up and throw away the key
I'm imprisoned in love is what I want to be
