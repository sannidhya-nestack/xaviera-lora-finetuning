It's ending
Your ending
Hollow as we are
You are not me
I don't say for you
Who is your identity
Forsake your memory
Lose yourself
View the ugly face
Are you glad?
You have to be something
You are dead
I just can't feel the return of empathy
Like saying, "Well, tell us our thoughts in a way where nobody knows who I care"
One year left to free up one year, got a chance
One year, what do we live for? One year, bring me back to God
The people, the pain they've sent me
They'll see the flame, yeah, bleeding
Suffering before we bow down
Pray in my grave
They'll all pay for the pain they've sent me
They'll see the blame
Suffering for me now, now
Paying my blame
Everything I hate is sitting inside me
I feel what I've become
Can you hear the devil crying?
This blood will see my final death
One year, lots of freedom
One year, not again
One year, what do we live for?
One year, free me from God
She stole my hatred
She hurt my pain
She couldn't handle what I kept locked inside me
Locked me here to bleed
