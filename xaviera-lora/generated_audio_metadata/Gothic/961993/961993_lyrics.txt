I know it's you, I can see it in your eyes
Things you can't hide'cause the truth is in your lies
Hide behind your comfort and you hide behind your gain
All you get out of life is your personal gain
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realise that you made a big mistake
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realise that you made a big mistake
Craving for your wealth and the more and more you make
Some poor innocent struggles on your teeth
Hiding all your guilt and you're always all ashamed
All the rules are broken and you don't want to blame
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realize that you made a big mistake
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realize that you made a big mistake
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realize that you made a big mistake
Benefit yourself and you benefit the state
Gotta come to realize that you made a big mistake
