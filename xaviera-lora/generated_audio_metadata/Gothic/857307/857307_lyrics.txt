Stand alone in an open field
Now it's time for you to be real
What you say and what you do now
Will light up somehow
Can't see inside
It's all digital black
What you do what you feel right now
It's all digital black
What you say what you want right now
It's all
Take your soul black
All you see, all you fantasize now
It's all
Take your soul black
Time to keep on going
Do you never know?
Keep on walking, keep on crying
Making sure that you won't know
Every time I see your face
I feel real rage
Moving into this storm
Making sure that I'm reborn
Can't see inside
It's all digital black
What you do, what you feel right now
It's all digital black
Time to keep on going
Do you never know
Keep on walking, keep on grind
Making sure that you will know
Oh, I see all I want to be
Oh, I know what I want to see
Think it can be the one
Making sure I'm in the sun
Never see, never want to be
Never feel, never want to see
Now that it's just begun
Now I know Christ is the one
Can't see and say
It's all digital black
What you do what you feel right now
It's all digital black
What you say, what you want right now
It's all too little to black
All you see, all you fantasize now
It's all too little to black
