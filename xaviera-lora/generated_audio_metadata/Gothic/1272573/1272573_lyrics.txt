Deep in the mud where the dead don't sleep
Ghouls rise up from the murky deep
Crawling out with a banshee grin
Clawing up fingers, rotten skin
Sloth what you stir with a wicked spell
Laughing loud at the gates of hell
Eyes like fire burning red
Dancing with the restless dead
Deep in the mud where the dead don't sleep
Ghouls rise up from the murky
Crawling out of the bed she grinned
Clawed up fingers rotten skin
Swat the disturbed with a wicked smell
Laughing loud at the gates of hell
Eyes like fire burning red
Dancing with the restless dead
If our ghouls think of haunted ground
We're the lost and the damned around
Ghouls and swamp witches cackling in the night
Ghouls and swamp witches creeping out of sight
Ghouls in a swamp, witches laughing at your screams
Ghouls in a swamp, witches tearing at your dreams
There's spells in the moonlit mire
In the flames of a cursed desire
With their bony hands they drag you down
But beneath the roots where the lost are found
This is a ghoul's feast on the souls they steal
Claw and tooth, they crave the thrill
Drunk on fear they kill
The year is thick with the dark delights
They haunt the dreams that flee the lights
Ghouls in a swamp, witches cackling in the night
Ghouls in a swamp, witches creeping out of sight
Ghouls in a swamp, witches laughing at your screams
Ghouls in a swamp, witches tearing at your dreams
Cerebellum bones and blackened ashes
In the swamp where the dead things thrash
Dancing'round the cauldron fire
Feeding off your worst desire
Echoes of a twisted laugh
In the swamp they plot their path
No one's safe from the witch's wile
As the ghouls feast and the devils smile
Ghouls and swamp witches cackling in the night
Ghouls and swamp witches creeping out
Witches laughing at your screams
Ghouls and swamp witches tearing at your trees
The merc while the spirits play
They'll drag you down you'll lose your way
Ghouls and witches and hair
Dragon souls from the cursed land
Ghouls and swamp witches cackling in the night
Ghouls and swamp witches seeking you tonight
