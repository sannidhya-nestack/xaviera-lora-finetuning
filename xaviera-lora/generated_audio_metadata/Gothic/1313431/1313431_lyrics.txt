Soft whispers trapped inside the walls
Mirrored secret silence calls
Fragile heartbeats fading fast
Echo dreams behind the glass
Crystal breath on window panes
Velvet eyes conceal the pain
Melting softly losing form
Cold embrace forever warm
Feel the chill, the haunted space
Can't escape your ghostly trace
I'm just a ghost in the glass
Trapped inside the dreams we pass
Haunted heart, reflections lie
Watch me fade, don't say goodbye
Silver tears slide down my skin
Memories swirl closing in
Shattered smiles, quiet fears
Every touch just disappears
Echoes swirling round my bones
Sinking deep I drift alone
Chasing whispers I can't see
Locked within your memory
I'm just a ghost in the glass
Caught within your hidden past
I'm just a ghost in the glass
Trapped inside the dreams we pass
Haunted heart, reflections lie
Watch me fade, don't say goodbye
Ghost in glass, fading slow
Through the mirror, letting go
Touch my spirit, set me free
In the glass, you'll find me
