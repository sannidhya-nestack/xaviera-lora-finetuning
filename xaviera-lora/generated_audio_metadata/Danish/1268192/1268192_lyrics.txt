Drifting through the endless sky beneath the moonlight we lie
Stars whisper softly our names
In the calm of night we remain
Feel the ocean's gentle breeze
Whisper secrets through the trees
Time slows down, minutes fade
In this moment we stay swayed
Peaceful waves and silent tides, echoes of the distant guides
Close your eyes, let dreams flow
Where this journey takes us we go
Underneath the painted spout
Hear the nature's quiet call
Lost in thoughts, no need for words
In this place our hearts are stirred
Building lights in twilight years
Merging skies of countless blues
In the stillness lost and found
In the sound we're gently bound
Endless time in this retreat
Feel the rhythm, our heartbeat
Here with you we find our way
Through the night into the day
