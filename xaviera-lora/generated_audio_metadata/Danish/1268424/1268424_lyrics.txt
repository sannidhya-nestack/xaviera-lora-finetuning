When the morning light we rise so slow
Through the gentle breeze where the cool winds blow
Feel the rhythm of the ocean like a quiet dream
Lost in this moment where the world seems serene
Underneath the skies where the bluebirds fly
Watching time drift by, oh so high, so high
Whispering the secrets of a summer's day
In this tranquil place, we find our way
Close your eyes and drift away
In these peaceful times we'll always stay
Let the harmony guide you near
To a world so tall, free of fear
In the evening glow with stars so bright
Walking headland through the silent night
Feel the warmth of the sunset painting golden hues
In this tranquil place, before me
Down beneath the sky let the music flow
In the quiet nights where the soft lights glow
Listen to the echoes of a gentle tune
In this peaceful time under the moon
Close your eyes and drift away
In these peaceful times I'll always stay
Let the harmony guide you and me
Through a world so cold, free of fear
Stay with me, this summery space
In this quietness we find our embrace
Feel the whispers of a tender song
In this tranquil place where we belong
