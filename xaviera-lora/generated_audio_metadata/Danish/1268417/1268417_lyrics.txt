In the soft glow of twilight's end
The city's alive, but I'm with the wind
Gentle whispers of the evening breeze
Carry me far, put my mind at ease
Underneath the starry door so wide
Silent footsteps in the ebbing tide
In the rhythm of the distant waves
Find the calm in the life they saved
Drifting slowly, time slips away
Night embraces what's left of the day
Light the candles, let shadows play
Let the worries of the world decay
Melodies of midnight serenade
Echo softly through the cool arcade
In the quiet of this tranquil place
Every heartbeat finds a tender grace
Close your eyes and breathe out the night
Feel the peace in the soft moonlight
Here in the hush where dreams ignite
Find yourself in the gentle light
Drifting slowly, time slips away
