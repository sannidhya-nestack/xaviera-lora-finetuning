In a quiet night, the stars shine bright
Gentle waves whisper in sight
Cool breeze through the trees, find serenity with ease
City lights in the distance, so far
In the stillness, here we are
Close your eyes, breathe in slow
Feel the peace
Let go of the past, the future's unknown
In this moment, you're not alone
Heartbeats sink in perfect rhyme
Lose yourself outside of time
Skies of blue, dawn's first light
Endless days soft and bright
Moments drift like a dream
Life is calm, a gentle stream
