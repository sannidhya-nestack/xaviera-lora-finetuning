In the cool night, when the moons glow
Where the salt winds gently blow
Find your peace, in the shadows
Let the calm within you grow
Stars above, they whisper love
Secrets that we used to know
Close your eyes, let your mind flow
To a place where time is slow
Feel the waves upon the coast
Sadder whispers we love most
Let the moments be your host
In this life we generally coast
Lost in dreams we come alive
In this space our spirits thrive
No worries here, just alive
Into the night, we simply glide
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In the cool light where dreams play
We find peace at end of day
Flowing softly come what may
In this tranquil place we'll stay
Feel the waves upon the coast
Silent whispers we love most
Let the moments be your host
In this life we journey slow
Feel the waves upon the coast
Silent whispers we love most
Silent whispers we love most
Silent whispers we love most
Feel the waves upon the coast
Silent whispers we love most
Silent whispers we love most
Feel the whispers we love most
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Lost in dreams we come alive
In the space our spirits thrive
No worries here just deep dive
Into the night we simply glide
Hold my hand and let's just be
In this quiet harmony
Find your heartbeat set free
In this night just you and me
