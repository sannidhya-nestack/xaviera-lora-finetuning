In the quiet of the evening
Where the soft winds gently play
We find a sense of freedom
In the calmness of the day
Stars above, they start to glimmer
As the night begins to bloom
Whispering tales of sweet surrender
In the stillness of the room
Close your eyes, feel the ocean
Hear the waves in gentle motion
Breathe in deep the peaceful notion
Let it carry you away
In the heart of quiet places
Underneath the moon's embrace
Time slows down, no need to hurry
Lost in tranquil, gentle space
Through the whispers of the twilight
We can find our dreams anew
In the dance of light and shadow
There's a world that's made for two
So let's drift into the night
Where the moments feel just right
Held by stars in tender light
the dawn brings back the day
Close your eyes, feel the ocean
Hear the waves in gentle motion
Breathe in deep the peaceful notion
Let it carry you away
In the quiet of the evening
