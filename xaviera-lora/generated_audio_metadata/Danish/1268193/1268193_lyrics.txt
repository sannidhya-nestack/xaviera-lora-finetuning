In the twilight we unwind
Whispers of the city gentle on the mind
Lights reflecting on the bay
Here with you I want to stay
Cool breeze and stars above
Lost in the night with the one I love
Time is slow in this embrace
Every moment's saving face
We're drifting slowly
Shadows dance so freely
Heart beats in the night
Softly love tastes like moments past like a dream
Life is sweeter than it seems hand in hand we roam together we are home
Moments pass like a dream
Life is sweeter than it seems
Hand in hand we roam
Together we are home
Waves kiss the silent shore
In this peace I adore
I speak without a word
In this world we are undeterred
We're drifting smoothly
Shadows dance so freely
Heart beats in the night
Softly love takes flight
Moments pass like a dream
Life is sweeter than it seems
Hand in hand we roam
Together we are home
In the quiet there's a song
In your arms I belong
Night fades, a new day
Love will guide the way
We're drifting slowly
Shadows dance so freely
Heart beats in the night
Softly love takes flight
Moments pass like a dream
Life is sweeter than it seems
Hand in hand we roam
Together we are home
