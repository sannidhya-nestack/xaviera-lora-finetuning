In the quiet of the evening
Where the waves kiss the shore
Time slows down, whisper softly
Never needing more
City lights fade away
As the stars take their place
In this gentle rhythm
We find our space
Feel the breeze through the trees
As we wander hand in hand
Underneath the moonlit sky
In our own wonderland
Moments drift like a dream
Floating free and unplanned
In your eyes, reflections of a world so grand
Hear the melody of night
Soothing every caraway
Every heartbeat in sync
As we sway, as we sway
Lost in the lullaby
Where the shadows play
Side by side we find our way
Hear the melody of night
Soothing every care away
Every heartbeat in sync
As we sway, as we sway
Lost in the lullaby
Where the shadows play
Side by side
We find our way
Let the silence speak to us
In its tender sweet embrace
Every whisper of the wind
A memory to trace
We are here, we are now
In this tranquil space
In the stillness, love's gentle grace
No rush, no hurry
Just the calm of the sea
In this moment, we are free
Just you and me
Life's a gentle journey, like the waves endlessly
Together we'll be just simply peacefully
