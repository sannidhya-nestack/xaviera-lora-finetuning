In a quiet place where the shadows play
Underneath the stars, dreams gently sway
Whispers in the wind carry secrets sold
In the calm of night, stories softly told
Rest your weary mind, let the peace unfold
In this tranquil time, let your heart be bold
With the moon's embrace, feel the evening's grace
Lost within the night, in this sacred space
Drifting on a wave, let your worries go
Feel the cool breeze touch as it starts to show
Every hidden thought, every faintest doubt
In the soothing light they all filter out
Close your eyes and breathe in the silent glow
In this gentle hour, let your spirit flow
With the stars above guiding with their light in the still
