In the quiet of the evening
City lights are softly gleaming
We find solace in the shadows
Where the gentle breezes flow
By the river where we wander
Lost in thoughts we don't remember
Whispers of a distant dream
Echo through the silent stream
Stars above us, silent dancers
Moving to the night's romances
In this space I feel so free
Just you and me
Just you and me
Covered in the cloak of twilight
Every worry fades in moonlight
Wrapped in warmth that midnight brings
Peace is found in simple things
In the calm and in the stillness
Feel the world melt in iveness
Here with you it all makes sense
Love as pure as the innocence
Stars above us, silent dancers
Moving through the night's romances
In this space I feel so free
Just you and me
Just you and me
