Snow is falling still in the night
Children laughing, men at night
Lights are glowing over all
Feel the magic, can you make a
Reindeer dancing over sky
Christmas trees so tender, ahoy
Gifts are waiting on
Sing a carol, let's live it glad
You'll end sleep so bright, aklar
Fill my heart, bring us to a start
Family around, so care
Christmas time, mid-day love
Can't end sleep so bright, aklar
Fill my heart, bring us to a start
Family around, so care
Christmas time, me dealer
Candy canes of Pilbara
Baking cookies eat it full
Warm milk cocoa hold it tight
Best time of the year don't et
Whispers of love everywhere
Secret wishes we all share
Christmas bells, dear, ringing out
Feel the joy from head to head
You and me, so bright, all clear
Fill my heart, bring us to a start
Family around, so care-ed
Christmas time, me dealer
You sleep so bright, a clock
Fill my heart, bring us to start
Family around, so care
Christmas time, be dealer
