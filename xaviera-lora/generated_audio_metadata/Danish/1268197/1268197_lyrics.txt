Under the sky where dreams begin
In the whisper of the gentle wind
We find a place to rest our minds
Leave the world and time behind
Through the fields where shadows play
In the light of the fading day
We drift along on waves of sound
Feet no longer touch the ground
Stars above, a silent song
Tells us where our hearts belong
In this moment, here and now
We are free, we are somehow
Feel the rhythm, feel the night
Softly glowing silver light
Echoes dancing through the air
Whispers softly breathe in care
Broken thoughts they disappear
In the calm there's nothing to fear
Hold on tight to what is true
Feel the peace as it finds you
Together here we'll float away
Into night from the light of day
In the stillness we are found
In this space love will surround
Stars above, a silent song
Tells us where our hearts belong
In this moment, here and now
We are free, we are somehow
Feel the rhythm, feel the night
Softly glowing silver light
Echoes dancing through the air
Whisper softly breathe in care
Broken thoughts they disappear in the calm
Feel the night softly glowing
Softly glowing silver light
Echoes dancing through the air
Whisper softly breathe in care
