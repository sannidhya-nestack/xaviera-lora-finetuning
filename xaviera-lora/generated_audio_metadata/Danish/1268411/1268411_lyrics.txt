Under the northern lights we find our peace
In the whispering winds we let go and release
By the sea where the waves gently kiss the shore
Our hearts beat together
Forevermore in the cool night air
We breathe in the calm with your hand in mine
We're safe from harm, stars in the sky
Guiding our way in this tranquil space
We choose to stay
The rhythm of the trees, swaying to the breeze
In this serene place, we find our ease
We wander through the night, no need for words
Just the melody of nature
Softly heard, we float on gentle dreams
Held by the sky, with each other near
There's no need to cry
In the glow of the moon, our souls intertwine
In this peaceful refuge, you're forever mine
Lost in the moment, time stands still
Together we dance by the quiet hill
Echoes of laughter carried by the wind
In this blissful state let the journey begin
