In the still of the night, we walk alone
Underneath the stars, our hearts find home
The world slows down, whispers softly so
In this quiet place, our spirits flow
Warm winds carry dreams, where the oceans meet
Softly through the trees, the rhythm sweeps
Life's a gentle breeze
In this moonlit haze
We find our peace
In these tranquil days
Close your eyes, let go
We're drifting free over land and sea
Just you and me in this silent dance
We lose control, feel the calm embrace
And soothe our souls
When the mornings come with a golden light
We'll still be here wrapped in the night
Hearts beat as one in the dawn's embrace
And the glow will stay in the sacred space
