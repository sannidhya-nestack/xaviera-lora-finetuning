In the quiet of the night we roam
Underneath the stars we feel at home
Breezes whisper secrets in our ear
In this tranquil space we have no fear
City lights are fading far away
Nature's symphony begins to play
Time slows down, our worries drift apart
In this sacred calm, we heal our hearts
Floating on the tide, we journey free
Finding peace within the fluid sea
Moments blend in harmonies embrace
In this gentle flow we find our place
Whispers of the past are soft and low
Guiding us to where our spirits glow
In this endless dance of night and day
