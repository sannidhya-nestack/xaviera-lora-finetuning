Underneath the moonlit sky
Dreams take flight, we drift inside
Whispers in the cool night air
Softly touching hearts laid bare
Endless journey, stars aligned
Flowing like a glass of wine
Through the rhythm, through the time
Moments frozen so divine
In the shadows we find light
Through the silence pure delight
Footsteps gentle echo free
Dance with me just let it be
Set the calm the world is near
All our worries disappear
In this place we're free to roam
Let's call this place our secret home
Crystal streams and open seas
Nature sings in harmonies
Painted skies and fields of green
Living up this endless dream
In your eyes I see the stars
Boundless beauty near and far
Feel the breeze just hold me tight
In this world we'll be alright
Let the music guide us through
Every beat a wonderful
Heart united pure and true
Side by side just me and you
