Beneath the open skies where the cool breeze whispers low
In a world that seems so still there's a place that we both know
Gently swaying trees that leaves our stories in the air
We find the quiet moments living life without a care
With a cup of dreams we sit by the shore
Listening to waves craving nothing more
Under soft pastel hues the sun begins to set
In the calm of twilight we find peace in every breath
Through the cobblestone paths where memories unfold
The echoes of the past in a town so old
Candlelit dinners glowing in the night with laughter and love
Everything feels right
Wine in our glasses, music soft and clear
Melodies of romance whispered in your ear
Underneath the stars with the moon above
We dance to the rhythm in the night we fall in love
Embrace this sweet feeling
