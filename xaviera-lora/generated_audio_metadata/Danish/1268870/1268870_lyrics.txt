Waves are crashing on the shore
Whisper secrets nothing more
Moonlight dances on the sea
In this moment we are free
Gentle breeze feels like a kiss
Nature's lullaby pure bliss
Stars above they guide our way
Lost in dreams we softly sway
Let the night surround us now
Feel the peace and take a bow
In this place it's you and me
Underneath the canopy
Close your eyes and just exhale
Floating on this silver sail
Time stands still just let it be
Here with you eternally
Warmth of night and cool embrace slowly
