In the evening when the light is low
The world outside begins to slow
Find a place where I can be
Just a little closer to me
Where the whispers of the night
Fill the air with sweet delight
In the softness of the dark
I can listen to my heart
Feel the calmness in the air
All my worries disappear
In this moment I am free
This is where I want to be
Pair of eyes nose to nose
Every moment softly goes
Silent dreams gentle flow
In the quiet let it show
Day by day it slips away
But tonight I'm here to stay
In the stillness I find peace
In the space my thoughts release
In the rhythm of the night
Everything will be alright
Close your eyes and breathe with me
Feel this moment's melody
