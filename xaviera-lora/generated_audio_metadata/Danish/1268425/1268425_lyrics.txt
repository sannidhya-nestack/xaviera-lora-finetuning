Warm breeze through the fields we wander slow
Soft whispers in the twilight's glow
Under starlight where the trees unfold
Moments linger, stories yet untold
Golden mornings
Oceans wide we sail away
In the quiet let's escape the day
Find a rhythm where our hearts can play
Chasing sunsets in a sky of grey
Gentle waves upon the shore, we dance in time
Fading echoes in the moonlight climb
Dreams of distance in a whispered rhyme
Falling softly in this endless prime
Golden mornings
Oceans wide we sail away
In the quiet let's escape the day
Find a rhythm where our hearts can play
Chasing sunsets in a sky of grey
Gentle waves upon the shore we dance in high
Fading echoes in the moonlight climb
Dreams of distance in a whispered rhyme
Falling softly in this endless prime
Falling softly in this endless prayer
