In the morning light we whisper soft
Gentle breezes through the trees aloft
City sounds so far away
Calm and quiet you stay
Floating dreams we drift away
Silent echoes of the day
Underneath the sky so raw
In this moment we applaud
Close your eyes, just breathe it in
Feel the peace on your skin
In the stillness time suspends
In this moment we applaud
Close your eyes
Just breathe it in
Feel the peace on your skin
In the stillness
Time suspends
Here our journey never ends
Swaying leaves and tranquil streams
They live within these tents
No more rush, no more haste
Every second perfectly placed
In the twilight, stars align
Soft reflections, pure and fine
Hand in hand, we'll find our way
Through the night into the day
Close your eyes
Just breathe it in
Feel the peace on your skin
In the stillness, time suspense
Here our journey never ends
Close your eyes, just breathe it in
Feel the peace on your skin
In the stillness time suspends
In this moment we applaud
Close your eyes
Just breathe it in
Feel the peace on your skin
In the stillness time suspends
Here our journey never ends
Hold this feeling, never part
Tender moments in our hearts
Through the calm we understand
