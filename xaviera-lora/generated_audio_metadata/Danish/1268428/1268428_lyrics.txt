Sun arises, whispers so clear
Morning light drawing us near
Breathe in, let the stillness flow
Moments linger, soft and slow
Waters calm, reflections play
Dreams entwine night into day
Whispering winds secrets they know
Hush now let your worries go
On the skies of endless blue
Feel the world embracing you
Silence speaks, time drifts away
In this peace, let us stay
Soft shadows dance, gentle embrace
Find your rhythm, find your space
Clouds drift by, weightless and free
In this calm, just let it be
Under skies of endless blue
Feel the world embracing you
Silence speaks, time drifts away
In this peace, let us stay
In this peace, let us die
In this peace, let us stay
In this peace, let us die
On the skies of endless blue
