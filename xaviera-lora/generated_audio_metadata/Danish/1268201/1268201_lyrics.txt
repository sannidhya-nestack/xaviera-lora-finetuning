In the calm of the night
Stars are shining bright
Dreams are taking flight
In this quiet light
Whispers in the air
Feel the gentle care
Love is everywhere
In this moment rare
We find peace within
Let the journey begin, in the stillness spend
Feel it on your skin, in the heart of the breeze
Moving with such ease, nature's melodies, bring your mind to ease
Softly drift away in this tranquil bay
Here we'll always stay'til the break of day
Harmony and grace in this sacred place
Feel the warm embrace
Gentle slow the pace
In the heart of the breeze
Moving with such ease
Nature's melodies
Bring your mind to ease
Softly drift away
Here we'll always stay,'til the break of day
Harmony and grace, in this sacred place
Feel the warm embrace, gentle slow the pace
