Under the same moon as two lovey
Dance with me tonight
Lose your skin or bright or die
Hold me hold me tight
Step by step you think of I
Getting lead and lead
Your love makes me sway like a disco song
Silver moon
Disco
Will never let go
Danish nights are blue
Dance in shadows below
Gliopto are skinned out
Me skin are bright and free
In the moonlight spot it's you and me
Stars are singing high
But humans should not be
Feel your heart beat right
No human we can't see
Silver moon disco
We'll never let go
Pain is a soft glow
Dancing shadows below
Ooh
Step by step within our mind, can't end love
Your love makes me sway like a disco song
Silver moon, disco, we'll never let go
Danish nights are glow, dancing shadows below
Dyrna på skynna
Vi skynner bright and free
In the moonlight spot
It's you and me
Stars are singing high
På hynden synner vi
In our hearts being right
Med ryggen i hensyn
Silver moon
Disco
We'll never let go
Danish nights are glow
Dance in shadows below, moon
Stars are spinning high
But humans do not die
Feel our hearts beat right
No rhythm you can't see
Silver moon, disco
Won't never let go
Danish nights are gold
Dancing shadows below
Silver moon, disco, whenever I go
Danish nights are blue, dancing shadows below
