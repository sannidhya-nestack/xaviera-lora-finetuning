I feel like swaying'til the rhythm of your heartbeat
And I go deep inside each other's soul
In every beat there's a song so sweet
That needs us to slip inside our soul
When we're together time slips away
No fears on them, feel it till the distance
Dancing through the night'til the break of day
The dance I never learned today gets old
I feel like swaying to the rhythm of your heartbeat
In spite of everything that it can't explain
Lost in the music in a love so deep
For talking and singing
In Cali hills, some Aggies
Your touch, your touch, it whispers secrets to my soul
Din de var in the sky, make you a teniche
In your arms, I find my home
Akinna am a finna yahi
When we're together, everything's alright
And I'll be your salmon, and every song you scan
Dancing through the stars, in the pale moonlight
Vi danser gennem stjerner med en måneskær
I feel like swaying to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Jeg smøter ryggen er i hjerteslag
Lost in the music in a love so deep
For takken med sikren en kærlighed som magisk
Every moment with you is a melody
That I have written about at a melody
In this dance of love we find our harmony
I can't carry this dance without me harmony
I feel like swaying to the rhythm of your heartbeat
It's fine to flip and end it jealously
Lost in the music in a love so deep
On top you're musicin' in Callaham, St. Maggie's
I feel it swayin', swayin' through your heartbeat
You're trying to get us made
In your arms, in your arms so sweet
On top you're musicin' in Callahams, St. Maggie's
I'm feeling to your heartbeat
Esfajot erit jære sig
In your arms, in your arms so sweet
A dine arme så såg ut arme
