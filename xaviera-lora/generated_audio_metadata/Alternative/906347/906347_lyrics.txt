Don't blame it on fate
Don't blame it on bad luck
Don't walk away
Giving up is what they want
They tell me I should run
But I'm not yet done
Because back and down
We'll be watching all fall to the ground
I'm not ready to give up
It's been one long climb, I've had enough
I'm a broken glass beyond its repair
I wanna give up all my plans
But I know better'cause I know who I am
Don't criticize
Too much is on the line
Don't listen to their lies
You don't need to hear it this time
There will come a day
You won't feel this way
I dare you push along
Keep holding on
Keep marching on
I'm not ready to give up
It's been one long climb, I've had enough
I'm a broken glass beyond its repair
I wanna give up all my plans
I know better'cause I know who I am
Hold on to what you know
That's all you need
So don't let go
Hold on to what you know
I'm not ready to give up
I'm not ready to give up
It's been one long climb but I'll finally make it up
I'm a broken glass, the only guess is that it's
I wanna give up all my plans
I know better'cause I know who I am
I know who I am
I know who
I know who I am, I know who I am
