Well, there's a crazy little joint where they're gonna be rocking tonight
They got a crazy little band and they know how to rock it right
They got a hillbilly drummer and a big dog house
And a squeeze box player coming up from Taos
To a crazy little joint, it's gonna be rocking tonight
And it's a rock, rock, rock, rock
We gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
We gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
We gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
Gonna rock, rock tonight
Well there's a girl working there serving whiskey, beer and wine
She's got a ponytail hair and a walk that's so divine
She's the cutest little baby that I ever met
She can blow a bubblegum and smoke a cigarette
In a crazy little place where they're gonna be rocking tonight
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock, yeah we're gonna rock
Rocking away tonight
Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
And let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock, rock it away in the night
