I got a crazy little baby but she's not too crazy about me
She got a nasty way of talking to me that you wouldn't believe
Tells me that I'm always gonna be her man
But she chased me downtown with a frying pan
Crazy little baby but she's not too crazy about me
People pick her up at 8 for a date on a Saturday night
Twenty minutes later well you know we're getting into a fight
Tell me let's start good please take her home
But when the clock strikes twelve she's ready to roam
Crazy little baby but stop to please stop me
I took her downtown, bought a diamond ring
Threw it down the sink, said, "The hell with that thing !"
Took her out for dinner in her itchy little place
Threw a glass of whisky right in my face
Crazy little baby, but she's not too crazy'bout me
She got a nasty way of talkin' to me that you wouldn't believe
Tellin' me that I'm always gonna be her man
But she chased me downtown with a frying pan
Crazy little baby, but she's not too crazy'bout me
Yeah, rockin' now, yeah
I took her downtown, bought a diamond ring
Threw it down the sink, said, "The hell with that thing !"
Took her out for dinner, in direction to the place
Threw a glass of whiskey right in my face
Crazy little baby, but she's not too crazy'bout me
She got a nasty way of talking to me, but you wouldn't believe
Tells me that I'm always gonna be her man
But she chased me downtown with a frying pan
Crazy little baby, but she's not too crazy'bout me
I got a crazy little baby but she's not too crazy'bout me
I got a crazy little baby but she's not too crazy'bout me
