The whipping winds whispered I shouldn't worry
Upon my face grew these tired lines
A race to the seas that we must bury
The snow remains
Beneath the thickest pines
When the sun decides to go away
And darkness fills this heart again
Will the wind still sing to me the same way
And I'll find out
If the sun comes up tomorrow again
And I'll find out how fast things change
Oh, here I'll stand for you
Breathing life renewed
Stand alone
Waiting for the one to come and save me from this emptiness
Here I'll stand for you
Built my home to plant my roots
The joy I found in simple times
Marking paths with the stamp of my boots
I decree I've paid for my crimes
Here I'll stand for you
Breathing life renewed
Stand alone
Waiting for someone to come and save me from this emptiness
Can this happiness last forever?
Here I stand for you
Here I'll stand for you, you
