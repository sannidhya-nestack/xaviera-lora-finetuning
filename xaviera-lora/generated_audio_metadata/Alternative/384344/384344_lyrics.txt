Yesterday a man living on the street
Came up to me, I thought for something to eat
But he instead told me a story
Said he's been telling everyone he meets
Says he met a man
That morning who gave him food that always fills
He gives strength and he gives courage
To anyone who calls his name
No matter who, no matter when
He'll be the one to lift you out, out of the hole you're in
I asked him who was this man he spoke of
And is he nearby so that I can see
If he could analyze my problems
Seems all my joy has gone out of me
I need someone to heal my spirit
The man said sure, I know he can
'Cause he gives strength and he gives courage
To anyone who calls his name
No matter who, no matter when
He'll be the one to lift you out, out of the hole you're in
No matter how low you are
I know someone who will be there for you
To bring you through
He holds me, he's with me wherever I go
And no matter what comes I know
That he gives strength and he gives courage
To anyone who calls his name
No matter who, no matter when
He'll be the one to lift you out
He gives strength and he gives courage still and he's the one who calls his name no matter who, no matter when
He'll be the one to lift you out
He is straight and he is kind to anyone who calls his name, no matter who, no matter where, he'll be the one to let you out
He gives strength and he gives courage (He gives strength and he gives courage)
He gives strength and he gives courage (He gives strength and he gives courage)
He gives strength and he gives courage
