I remember way back when
Before you were a man
Whatever happened to your dreams and aspirations
Had your future planned
Knew how it started
How it ends
Now it's changed
Such a crying shame
Tell me who's to blame
Could have been so good
Should have been
Should have been
How did it turn so bad
Who's to blame
You again
Why did it have to be
Such a waste of energy
Could have been
Should've been
Always were that kind of guy
Like to pretend that you were shy
Should've been real
Maybe that was half the trouble
Can't believe all of the years
You wanna try and be sincere
Haven't learned
Still the same
Nothing's changed
Could have been so good
Should have been, should have been
How did it turn so bad
Who to blame, you again
Why did it have to be
Such a waste of energy
Could have been, should have been
You had good chances of a lifetime
So don't come running back to me (don't come running back to me)
You knew what you were doing your way
Play hard you got to play
Could have been so good, should have been, should have been
How did it turn so bad, who to blame, you again
Why did it have to be such a waste of energy
Could have been, should have been
Could have been so good, should have been, should have been
