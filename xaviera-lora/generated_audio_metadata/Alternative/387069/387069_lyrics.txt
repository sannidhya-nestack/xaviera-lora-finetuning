Love's seen better days
There's always something
I don't have the nerve to say
Caught in a loveless hide
One of the many souls
Dread from their loving homes
Haunted love, sorry babe
That is all I have today
Haunted love, sorry babe
All incentive seems to point this way
Haunted love, sorry babe
Wanna go but have to stay
Haunted love, sorry babe
All incentive seems to point this way
Love they say can save the lost
Can you feel the shape of longing
To be only alone
Seems to be my sentence here
Touch my lips my dear
I feel alone, I feel
Hornet love, sorry babe
That is all I have today
Hornet love, sorry babe
All in Santa, seems to want this way
Hornet love, sorry babe
Wanna go but have to stay
Hornet love, sorry babe
Haunted love, haunted love, haunted love
Haunted love, haunted love, haunted love
Oh, hey, what you do for a lover?
Oh, hey, oh, hey, what you do for a lover?
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, what you do for another?
Oh, hey, oh, hey, what you do for another?
Oh, hey
