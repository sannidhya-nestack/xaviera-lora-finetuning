Should have read all the signs
Thought we had bested times
That it made me the fool
Living it through and through
Now this soul's running free
Did you know
Don't feel the need to persuade you
Surfacing from this lie
And I don't wanna free us
I don't wanna heal us
I will never cave in
I will never break
No rhyme, you may be so bold
Just how low will you go?
Make it so, let's just break it down
Enough with your stupid little secrets
Ooh, who do you think you are?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And when you're ready to go
I will have simply moved on
Now it's my turn to play
I've got nothing to prove
But it's not like you would know (it's not like you would know)
Shielded from remarks you throw
You're just too late
My own butterfly
Has arm rings to testify
No rhyme, you may be so bold
Just how low will you go?
Make it so, let's just break it down
Enough with your stupid little secrets
Ooh, who do you think you are?
Oh, oh, oh
You, you're sensational, irreplaceable
I'm infected with your heart's gold
You, quite phenomenal
Had me hooked right from the start
You, you're insatiable, inexplainable
I'm injected with this ice cold
Here, I'm responsible
You never played your part
Yet I'm still loathed
No, Brad, you may be so bold
Just how low will you go?
Making soul lapses, breaking down
Enough with your stupid little secrets
Who do you think you are?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
