Drifting through the walls of life
Dreams, I'm lost and alive
Whispers call my name, please wait
I'm not ready to be found
My heart's delicate like a fading breeze
Summer hates clothes, even me
But I need your touch (can you hear me?)
We're floating softly, caught up in the blue
Show me the way that your light breaks through
They take all they see and leave me bare
My soul is worn out, friends hanging off, yeah
I still believe, don't let, you fall in shadows again
I'm spitting free all this endless air
Summer haze glow
Can you bring me back
I need your touch
Can you bring me back
Floating softly
Caught up in the blue show me the way
Let your light break through
Please keep me here
This gentle space
Guide me with your grace
Forever embrace
In the weightless breeze
Let us find peace
Together we rise
Set our spirits free
Summer hates glow
Keepin' me back
I need your touch
Keepin' me
A floating softly caught up in the blue
Show me the way that your life breaks through
