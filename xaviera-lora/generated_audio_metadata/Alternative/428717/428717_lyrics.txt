I love the way we come alive
Through summer days, electric nights
I love the way
It feels so right
On summer days
Electric nights
Electric nights
I'm sitting at the top and I'm dreaming
I'm waiting for the show to begin
I'm thinking'bout your love and those big blue eyes
Can't wait for you to hold me again
You take me on a journey to heaven
I'm floating, I'm on top of the world
Together we can fly on a cloud so high
I never could have made it alone
I love the way
We come alive
Through summer days, electric nights
I love the way it feels so right
On summer days
Electric knives
Electric knives
We come alive
Electric knives
We come alive
You're giving me this new inspiration
Together we can make it so strong
I'm standing in the shadows of yesterday
It's better now I know we belong
I love the way
We come
I'm alive through summer days
Electric nights, I love the way
And it feels so right
I found inspiration on summer days
Electric nights
