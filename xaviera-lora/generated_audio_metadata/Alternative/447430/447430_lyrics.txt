Down in New Orleans in a shack by the water
My future found me in the shadows of a quarter
Fell down an alley off of Bourbon Street
I was going half crazy from the crowds in need
Could have been a spell or a hurricane
When a voice from the dark whispered my name
Slipped down an alley to a dark back room
Heard a phantom in the dark sing a gypsy tune
Bantam, roulette, and defoulet, fou
Life in the quarter could be strange and cool
Bad luck to talk about the things I've seen
There's no one meaner than the Gypsy Queen
I laughed out loud when she spoke of luck
Reached in my pocket for my twenty bucks
I didn't recognize the letter she wrote
a five-sided star and the head of a goat
She read my palm and she told me that
In my future was the name Lestat
Then she finished and I had to go
Next stop the grave of Marie Laveau
Pont-a-roulette and beffoulet food
But in the quarter could be strange and cruel
Bad luck to talk about the things I've seen
There's nowhere nearer than the Gypsy Queen
Went to the graveyard just about midnight
I saw something flying in the pale moonlight
Next thing I was waking and I felt my neck
There were two little lumps that were kinda wet
Since that day I live for the night
I glide the alleys away from the light
There's only one way that I'll ever depart
It's when I leave with a stake in my heart
Bonne chance, roulette, meffoulet, fou
Life in the quarter could be strange and cruel
Bad luck to talk about the things I've seen
There's no one meaner than the Gypsy Queen
