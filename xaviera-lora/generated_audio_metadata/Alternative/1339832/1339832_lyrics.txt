She wore her words like velvet lace
A puzzle wrapped in a perfect face
Her eyes were knives they cut through stone
She danced in shadows claimed my throne
I asked her name, she gave a smile
Her love could twist the hands of time
I met the devil, she spoke in flames
Her mind a fire that I couldn't tame
She kissed my soul and I lost my name
I met the devil and she won the game
Her voice a whisper yet it screamed like thunder wrapped in a fever dream
Her wit a blade her tongue a spark she lit the match that burned the dark
I tried to run she held me still her power bent my every will
She spun her tongue with velvet thread
A thousand truths that bled me red
She wrote the rules then bent them twice
I paid her toll and rolled the dice
I met the devil
And roll the dice
