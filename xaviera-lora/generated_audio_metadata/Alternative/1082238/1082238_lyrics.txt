Sometimes I can't believe it's true
Sometimes I fly in outer space
My dreams come true
And I'm still the one you loved
I feel the attraction between us
And other things can turn to dust
Don't even need creative comfort
Baby I just need you by my side
Ooh, I
Let's take it forever
Ooh, I
this time will be never enough
Never and never enough
Never and never enough
this time will be never enough
Never enough
Never and never enough
Never and never enough
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Let's take it forever
Ooh, ah, let's take it forever
Ooh, ah,'cause this time will be never enough
Never and never enough
Never and never enough
this time will be never enough
Ooh, ah, let's take it forever
Ooh, ah,'cause this time will be never enough
Never and never enough
Never and never enough
this time will be never enough
