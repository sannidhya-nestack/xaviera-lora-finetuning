If this is who we are, then what are we here for?
Floating in a universe, a simulation or a curse
If this is who we are, then what are here for?
Living in a crazy world
If this is who we are
I'm feeling like I'm running out of time
In this matrix, work out life
It's like a video game
We are running the same time of hell on headwave
If this is who we are, then what are we here for?
Floating in a universe, a simulation or a curse?
If this is who we are, then what are here for?
Living in a crazy world
If this is who we are
I spent most my years running away from fear
But now I wanna use the spear
To cut all of that off, get another shot
I don't want to end this time, I wanna win
If this is who we are, then what are we here for?
Floating in a universe, a simulation or a curse?
If this is who we are, then what are here for?
Living in a crazy world
If this is who we are
If this is who we are, then what are we here for?
Flooding in a universe, assimilation or a curse
If this is who we are, then what are we here for?
Living in a crazy world
If this is who we are (I'm feeling like I'm running out of time)
If this is who we are (I'm stuck in this matrix to recover)
If this is who we are (I spent most of this time in a way that I feared)
But now I want to use the mirror (If this is who we are)
