What if you saw
Life in all possible ends
Like you had gone
In every infinite way
Out of the path
That led you here way
With me
Would you trace fingerprints
To the maker who paired us by hand
Would you see no such design
By all the lives you could have had
That would have brought to you
A greater love
Am I
Am I made for you
To get nothing
Am I made for you
To get nothing back?
Oh nothing back
I get nothing back
I get nothing back
I am me
For you, I get nothing back
I get nothing back
I get nothing back
I am made for you, I get nothing
We can only find direction from where we have came
And in the life we've made
We're bound to the end that it holds
But would your endless sights
Find truer fate than ours?
