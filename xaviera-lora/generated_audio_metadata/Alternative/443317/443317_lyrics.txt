Since when did you have such high regard for yourself
You couldn't make it two weeks alone without my help
When I met you your situation was in disarray
I don't know what I ever saw in you anyway
But you
Can't desert me now
You
Can't desert me now
You've embarrassed me countless times before
Without a care
I always knew that your character was flawed
Beyond repair
I was never impressed with anything you had to say
I realized very early on that you were just dead weight for you
Can't desert me now
And you
Can't desert me now
And who will try to shame you
And who will get too rough
And who will make it crystal clear
That you never measured up
Who'll make you feel dirty
And who'll ignore your pain
And who will disappoint you
Again and again and again and again and again
Ah for you
You can't desert me now
You
Can't desert me now
You
(I'm not gonna stop)
(I'm not gonna stop)
(I'm not gonna stop)
(I'm not gonna stop)
(I'm not gonna stop)
