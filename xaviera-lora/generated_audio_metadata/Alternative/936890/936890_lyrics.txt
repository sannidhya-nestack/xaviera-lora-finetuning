You give me what I need
All the time relentlessly
So how could I ever let you go
I get them
To all of you
I will not let you go
I need you
I want you
Can't let you go
Cause you know what I need
I need
Cause you know what I need, I need
Cause you know what I need, I need
Cause you know what I need, I need
Cause you know what I need
'Cause you know what I need, I need
you know what I need, I need
you know what I need, I need
you know what I need
Breathe you in all the time
It's like I need you to survive
To survive, to survive
I need you, I want you, can't let you go
'Cause you know what I need, I need, I need you
I want you, can't let you go
you know what I need, I need
