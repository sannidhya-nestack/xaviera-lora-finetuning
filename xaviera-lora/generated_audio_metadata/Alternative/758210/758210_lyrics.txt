I ain't got nothing to worry about
All of my troubles gone, that's what's up
I don't need your company
To tell me what I should do
But if you are willing
I can share this bottle with you
Yeah, yeah
Rub it on the glass, that's it
So wake me up, I'm not the bio
Let's drink it up until tomorrow
We ain't got no worries, no problems around
Just keep on drinking and wash'em up down
I don't need your sympathy
I know what to do
So shut off your mouth
Or the next round's on you
So break me up
The bottle was raking up until tomorrow
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, da
Na, na, na, na, na, la
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Break me up
And I'll devour you
Shrink it up
Until tomorrow
Break me up
We're down the bottle
Let's drink it up until tomorrow
