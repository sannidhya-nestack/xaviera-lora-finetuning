Every sound composed to an orchestrated song
From what noise music formed
But I was feeling terrified
Of the beauty held inside
A melody I've not heard before
A melody I've not heard before
And may my ears be strong enough to last'til
The higher I climb, the greater the risk
I'm weak enough to fall and break
I'm winding the clock as everything turns
Fragile as glass in the here and now (I'm too fragile to lie and sleep)
A shudder dropped to reveal
The entire spectrum of light
To kindle the ignorant eyes
But I was feeling terrified
Of the beauty held inside
A colour I have not seen before
A colour I have not seen before
May my eyes be
Quicken up to focus
The higher I climb the greater the risk
I'm weak enough to fall and break
I'm winding the clock as everything turns
Fragile as glass in the here and now
Ready to cut close to the lion's feet
Quickly I will et
What have you done for me?
I will et what brought me here
Over and over again
The higher I climb, the greater the risk
I'm weak enough to fall and break
Unwinding the clock as everything turns
Fragile as glass in the here and now
