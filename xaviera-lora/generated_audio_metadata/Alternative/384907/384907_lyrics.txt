Ask me how much it meant to me
I'll tell you so, so much so
You said I made you proud
When I was cold, when I was hungry, I'm down, I'm low
you are my brother, a blessed rose
You are my brother, a hollow gold
You are my brother and you inspire, inspire, inspire
On the deadline, the rising came
The rains fell for thirty days
And I was running nowhere fast
You said don't worry
I got your back,'cause you are my brother, a solid brave
You are my brother, a pretty white wave
You are my brother and you inspire, inspire, inspire
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are
I'm coming home
It's been so long, we traveled far as desert songs
And in my lonesome time of doubt
You lifted me through the clouds
you are my brother, a blessed rose
You are my brother, a high heeled gold
You are my brother and you inspire
Inspire, ah-ah-ah
You are my brother, a solid breeze
You are my brother, a pretty white wave
You are my brother and you inspire
Inspire, inspire
'Cause you are my brother, a solid brave
You are my brother, a pretty white wave
You are my brother and you inspire, inspire, inspire
You are my brother, a solid brave
You are my brother, a pretty white wave
You are my brother and you inspire, inspire, inspire
