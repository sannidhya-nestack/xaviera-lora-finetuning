Once upon a time on a dark lovers lane
Had a big sugar whiskey and a full moon to blame
I asked if you could tell me what you were thinking of
You didn't even blush when you said "Hillbilly love"
I knew that you were choking when you started to proceed
To take the kind of loving only hillbillies need
Just about that time came a-ridin' above
The officer spat when he saw hillbilly love
Yeah, hillbilly love, it came from the east
It ain't no kinda lovin' for no man or no beast
Hillbilly love, it moved to the west
It's the kinda lovin' that we all love the best
I took it out to Central, it was the worst of my fears
Stood me right in front of twelve of my peers
The judge asked the sheriff what I was accused of
Someone screamed when the sheriff said, "Help and love"
The sheriff gave a hand, picked the judge off the floor
Judge stood on up and said, "Now please tell'em more"
The sheriff said, "Ain't kidding"
Went push comes and shoved
I could tell by the spell it was hillbilly love
Yeah, hillbilly love that came from the east
It ain't no kind of love you know, no man or no beast
Hillbilly love that moved to the west
It's the kind of loving that we all love the best
Prayed to be delivered
I cried and then I wailed
But they gave me my deliverance
In the Horton County Jail
I'm hoping that some day
I'll get a pardon from the Gov
But until that fair day comes
I'm getting hillbilly love, yeah
Hillbilly love, it came from the East
It ain't no kind of loving for no man or no beast
Hillbilly love, it blew to the West
It's the kind of loving that we all love the best
