Take your hand in mine
Let's go farther than ever
Before this time we're young
This could be forever
I'll take you where you wanna go (I'll take you where you wanna go)
I'll take you where you wanna go
So low
Don't wanna be solo
Without you here with me solo
Don't wanna be solo
Let's run away
Run away with me
It's like this was meant to be
We can take our time tonight
Under the neon skies, yeah
Let's run away
Run away with me
It's like this was meant to be
We can take our time tonight
Under the neon skies, yeah
Let's run away
Solo, don't wanna be solo
Without you here with me
Solo, don't wanna be solo
Run away with me, it's like this was meant to be
We can take our time tonight under the neon skies, yeah
Let's run away, run away with me, it's like this was meant to be
We can take our time tonight under the neon skies yeah
Let's run away
Run away with me, it's like this was meant to be
We can take our time tonight under the neon skies, yeah
Let's run away (let's run away, let's run away)
Let's run away (let's run away, let's run away)
Take your hand in mine
Let's go farther than ever
Before this time we're young
This could be forever
I'll take you where you wanna go (I'll take you where you wanna go) (I'll take you where you wanna go)
