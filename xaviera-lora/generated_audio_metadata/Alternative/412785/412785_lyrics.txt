City of angels
Do you hear me
Can you feel what I feel
When I fall down
Oh how I've tried
Only to fail in this town
Ellie promised me everything
Sweet were the lies that she told
L .A. tempts you with luxury
But colder streets made of gold
Ooh, ooh, ooh
City of angels
Can you see me?
Can you fill this empty soul with your bright lights?
Oh, what after?
Hope in the air made it rise
Ellie promised me everything
Sweet were the lies that she told
Ellie tempts you with luxury
Colder streets made of gold
And it's
Promised me everything
Sweet were the lies that she told
And it tempts you with luxury
But cold are her streets made of gold
