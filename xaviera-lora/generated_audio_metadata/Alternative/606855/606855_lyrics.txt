So amazing to think of those who came before us
And those lining up now ready to join us
May we always remember that we're made of stardust
It's a beautiful noise we can make, rise and collect it
With wild mustangs in our hearts
Unbridled flames brighter than stars
The time is now we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
The time is now we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
Let's hold a high council with each other
The weight of the tribe is the only answer
For those hiding inside separation
We'll bring'em back to the light, global nation
With wild mustangs in our hearts
Unbridled flames brighter than stone
The time is now we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
The time is now we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
The time is now, we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
The time is now, we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
The time is now, we are the people
We're the heroes we've been waiting for
