If you ask me what I'm thinking
You may not want to hear
So ask me and I'll tell ya
I may be insincere
I may be unclear
Still you ask me what I'm thinking
You may not want to know
And I'll tell you so
I've been cheating
I've been mistreating
If you ask me what I'm thinking
You may not want to hear
So ask me and I'll tell ya
I may be insensitive
I may be unclear
You ask me what I'm thinking
You may not want to know
But I'll tell you so
I've been cheated on
I've been mistreated on
Through all these things I've been thinking
Through all these things I've been thinking
Through all these things I've been thinking
