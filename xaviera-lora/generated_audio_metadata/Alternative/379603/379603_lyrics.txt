Baby's been gone, she been gone for a long long time
Pushin' and pushin' out sometimes in my mind
You start believin' and my feelin' drives deeper inside
And it's like the first time that you meet her
Then you greet her with a shake and a smile
And I want you in my arms
But I don't know just where you are
And I'll see you soon, I know
And you'll like it, and you'll like it
Baby I know at times I don't satisfy you
I'm just a blue collar working man struggling to survive
I know that I don't make enough and my hands are tough like my soul
But I can change my ways I'll change anything for you
But you pushed me from your car
And I fell hard and left a scar
I call but you don't pick up your phone
And you hate me, why do you hate me?
Cause baby I'm there for you
Baby I'm there for you
Baby I'm there for you
Even if you're gone
Don't you know that I'm there for you
Even if you're gone
I'll be there for you
And I want you in my arms but I don't know just where you are
And I'll see you soon I know and you'll like it and you'll like it
