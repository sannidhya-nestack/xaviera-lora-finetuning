But in the wake of all this danger
There is hope shining bright
You think of what could be in waste
And play with hearts like they're made of glass
The dreams that we have
The lessons we learned
The stories we earned
Life falling down again
And I don't wanna make the same mistakes
All over again
Joy should be free for all the people
But man, I'm not getting enough
I'm not getting enough
I'm not getting enough
Oh, I'm not getting enough
Not falling down again
And I don't want to make the same mistakes all over again
Joy should be free for all the people
But man, I'm not getting enough
Nobody ever told me what to watch out for
Nobody ever mentioned the holes in the floor
So what you say, don't skip a beat
But in the wake of all this danger
There is hope shining bright
To think of what could be in words
To play with hearts like they're made of glass
The dreams that we have
The lessons we learn
The stories we earned
Not falling down again
And I don't wanna make the same mistakes all over again
Joy should be free for all the people
But man, I'm not getting enough
Listful wishes, a thousand kisses
Don't even prepare you for this horseshoe
Kissed for wishes, a thousand kisses
Didn't even prepare you for this horseshoe
Life can be dangerous, that's what I know now
Life can be dangerous
Give up, but that's not me
Wake up with a fantasy
Stand up on my own feet
I'm ready, look at me
