And you came before
I don't feel the way I've ever known
And you
Cause I don't feel good when I'm on my own
I don't take that well
Cause you were all I had
You come and grow
What I'll take I know I'll never earn
But I'll give my all
So you don't come back dead
'Cause you were all I had
And you were running, I got back
And I am nothing, all I am
So come back down
you were all I had
And you were all I got back
And how
I'll fit all under you, and I got back
And I'll fit all under you, and I got back
And have enough of all our dear ones
And have enough of all our dear ones
