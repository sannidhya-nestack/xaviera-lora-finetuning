Say you love me, say you need me, say you want me right now
In the morning, never leave me, can I be with you somehow
Then you told me I was nothing and you left me, I'm not well
I remember how you'd hold me, people tell me I'm not well
I'm not well, I'm not well
I'm not well
Love is but a dangerous play
I broke down, I begged you to stay
Loving you with more than grace
All alone, you've gone away
As the world begins to sway
The only place to be in vain
Hear your voice but on delay
And the thoughts begin to disappear
Say you love me, say you need me, say you want me right now
In the morning, never leave me, can I be with you somehow
Then you told me I was nothing and you left me, I'm not well
I remember how you'd hold me, people tell me I'm not well
E-e-e-e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e-e-e I'm not well, e-e-e-e-e-e
Since you wanna use big words like this is payday
How bout you learn reciprocated
You didn't think I would've skated
Broke hard plus sang I hit the pavement
Tough ain't it, tumultuous and tainted
And all because you painted me
Yeah, I'm masked man it's two faced like Harvey
Just cause I can don't make you Barbie
Say you need me, say you want me right now
In the morning, never leave me, can I be with you somehow?
Then you told me I was nothing and you left me, I'm not well
I remember how you'd hold me, people tell me I'm not well
Come back to me, I'm not well
Come back to me, I'm not well
I'm not well
I remember how you'd hold me, people tell me I'm not well
