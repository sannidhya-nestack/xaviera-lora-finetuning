One shot, I've got to get this one
One shot, I've got to get this right
One shot, I've got to get this one right
There's no help here, I'm out of luck, dear
I'm holding you near, I'm fighting for you now
Man down, I'm behind enemy lines
I can't punch through but I've gotta try
Catch your gun and run
It's your call of duty, son
To wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
Is this the last stop?
Is this the last drop?
Is this the last stop?
Is this the last drop?
Is this the last stop before I die?
This is the last stop, this is the last drop
This is the last stop, this is the last drop
This is the last stop before I die
Man down I'm behind enemy lines I can't punch through but I've gotta try
Can't choke on a run it's your call of duty son
To wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
Thanks for the picture
I'm glad to see my son looks like me
And thank you for the letter
This ocean between us is eating me alive
I miss home, I miss your voice, I miss your eyes
I can't wait to hear our baby cry
Now I've gotta go and finish what I begun
Get my gun and run, get my gun and run, get my gun and run
Man down, I'm behind, enemy lines I can't punch through but I've got to try
Get your gun and run, it's your call of duty son
To wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
Get your gun and run
It's your call of duty, son
Don't wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
Don't wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
Don't wander down the dusty streets of the enemy
