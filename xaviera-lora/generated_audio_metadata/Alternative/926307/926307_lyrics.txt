Lazy days by the beach
Jet streams in the skies above
I feel the sand beneath my feet
I feel the water
I feel it lapping in my toes
I feel the water round my feet
Wake up early, go outside
A new adventure, yeah best thing of late
No work, no stress, no bills to pay back then
Because it all just fades away
Oh it fades away my friends
Those lazy summer days, happy memories
You know the time when we were forever young
I wanna go back there, spend another day
Feel like I can be there forever young
I said be there forever young
Do you recall that sunny afternoon
I said you're sitting by the pool
Santa left the circus fruity
Yeah, yeah, those children playing around
We watched them run around back then
'Cause this summer days, those happy memories
You know the time when we were forever young
I wanna go back there, spend another day
Feel like I can be there forever young
Mm-hmm-hmm, I said be there forever young
Mm-hmm-hmm
You've got a smile, so use it now
We'll walk when we're on, let's have some fun
You've got a smile, so use it now
We'll walk when we're on, let's have some fun
Lazy days by the beach
Jet streams in the skies above
Feel the sand beneath my feet
I feel the water, I feel it lapping in my toes
I feel the water round my feet
Those lazy summer days
Happy memories
The time when we were forever young
Wanna go back there
Spend another day
Feel like I can be there forever young
Those lazy summer days
Those happy memories
You know the time when we were forever young
I wanna go back there
And spend another day
I feel like I can be there forever young
Those lazy summer days
Those happy memories
You know the time when we were forever young
I wanna go back there
And spend another day
I feel like I can be there forever young
Be there forever young
