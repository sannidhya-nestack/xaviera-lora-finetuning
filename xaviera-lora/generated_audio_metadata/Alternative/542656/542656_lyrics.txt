Drift away on a pipe of dreams to yesterday
Through a window to a world that isn't there
In spaces that we share
What feeds me
Destroys me
What feeds me
Destroys me
Is used
Nothing more and nothing left to lose
Ruined on a day that satisfied a need
For broken hearts to bleed
What feeds me destroys me
What feeds me
Destroys me
Selecting memories that change
Justifies the pain
What feeds me
Destroys me
What feeds me
Destroys me
What feeds me
Destroys me
What for his name
Destroys me
