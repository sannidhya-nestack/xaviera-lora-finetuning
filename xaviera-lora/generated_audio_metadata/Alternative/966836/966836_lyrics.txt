Another day with the sunny sky
Trying to light my way but I'd rather be in the dark
I fear all the romance in the stars
Surrounded by a universe with the moon and Mars
I feel it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Will you stay with me under the moonlight? (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
We'll be magical as we dream (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You won't know'til you try (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Under the moonlight
It wouldn't be the same without you here
You're my gravity that levels all my fears
Let's slip away far away from all this noise
Alone with our shadows
Feel our hearts beating more
I feel it (ah)
Will you stay with me
Under the moonlight (ah)
We'll be magical as we dream (ah)
You won't know'til you try
Under the moonlight
Will you stay with me under the moonlight?
We'll be magical as we dream
Will you stay with me under the moonlight?
We'll be magical as we dream
You won't know'til you try
Under the moonlight
Under the moonlight
