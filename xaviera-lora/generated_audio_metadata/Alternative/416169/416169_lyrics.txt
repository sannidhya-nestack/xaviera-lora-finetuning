Nathan Harrison bottle of wine
Steel toe boots at first and pine
Black lipstick backstage pass
Fishnet stockings and a martini glass
Tonight it's me and your ghost under the moon
Tonight it's me and your ghost under the moon
You're spattering in your leather coat, you say
Hey swing, where you going?
We meet up at the rendezvous
it's the only place where they can't find you
Motorhead is on the stereo
We're just a couple pirates out looking for gold
Rock stars and scene stars and strippers too
The only family I got is in this room
Tonight it's me and your ghost under the moon
Tonight it's me and your ghost under the moon
But I finally hit the road
I couldn't dial the telephone
Now your memory's haunting me
And all I know
Is how to undermine
Nathan Harrison, bottle of wine
Steel-toed boots at First and Pine
Black lipstick backstage pass
More fishnet stockings and a martini glass
But who was I to know we'd have nowhere to go
When a girl met the boy and the boy met the girl
Too high all the time and too filled up with lies
The only way out was go straight or go die
Tonight it's me and your ghost under the moon
Tonight's me and your ghost under the moon
Tonight's me and your ghost under the moon
