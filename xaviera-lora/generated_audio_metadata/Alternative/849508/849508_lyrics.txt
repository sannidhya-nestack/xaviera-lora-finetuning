Talk to me, tell me all your lies
Talk to me, I'll stand by your side
It's not what's there that's true
It's what you see when you close your eyes
Talk to me
Tell me what you felt
And I won't hold on
If you don't want me'round
I keep holding on
But I haven't got a clue
It's what the world has done
To make you
Talk to me
Tell me why we fight
It's all over soon
Don't waste another night
I've been living in a dream for too long, I've been living in a dream for too long
I keep holding on but I haven't got a clue
It's what the world has done to make you
I keep holding on but I haven't got a clue
It's what the years have done to me and you
Talk to me
Talk to me
