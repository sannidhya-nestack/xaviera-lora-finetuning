The wave comes to the shore and goes back to the sea
Its existence remains like an imprint on me
Oh oh oh
Whether floating in birth or disappearing in death
The ocean's awareness is an endless breath
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Life
Life
The bright and the darkness dwell within thee (light)
When it's beauty you dwell on you absorb what you see
Oh, eternal flame
Remember the lessons learned from the past (Light)
Dissolving all grievance, iving at last (Light)
Oh, oh, oh, light
Where there is light
Light
Where there is light
Life
The body has come and in time it will go (fly)
Becoming one with the ocean and the timeless flow
Oh, you are the light
The soul and the spirit no longer enslaved
Free to return in the form of a wave
Light
Where there is light
Light
Where there is light
Light
Life
Life
Where there is life
Life
