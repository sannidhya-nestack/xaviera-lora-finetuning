I'll watch you in your room for you
There's something you should know
But it's too soon
You see it in my skin
You caught up in the middle
To tell you who I am
Is a conversation killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
See you should stay away
It's a shame
I admit I'm hungry
But I'll refrain
You see it in my skin
But you're caught up in the middle
To tell you who I am
Is a conversation
Kill it
Please don't leave me
I don't care
I don't care
She said just get this over with
Sink your teeth in
It makes you like me
