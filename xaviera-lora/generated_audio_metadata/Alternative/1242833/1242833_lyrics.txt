Ask if I've got plans today
Don't let plans get in my way
And maybe I'll just fall back asleep
Let the day come to me
Sit back and let it be
It's more about the company you keep
I'm chillin' (Round and round it's sunny)
Just kick back and feelin' (Just chillin')
Your blues fade away
And you can join me if you're willing
I'm chillin' (Why not honey?)
Just lose yourself (Just chillin')
It's a beautiful day
Sometimes doin' nothin' can be thrillin'
I'm chilling
Just chilling
Swing by the old school ground
Kick an old tin can around
Swing by a deli named desire
Soul kitchen on the menu
Fried chicken and a shepherd's stew
If it's cool, cuddle by the fire
I'm chillin' (round and round it's sunny)
Just kick back (just chillin')
Your blues fade away
And you can join me if you're willing
I'm chillin' (why no honey)
(Just lose yourself) just chillin' (it's a beautiful day)
Sometimes doing nothing can be thrilling
I'm chillin' (I'm chillin')
Just chillin' (I'm chillin')
When the world gets crazy
Too much bad news
And you can't help feeling black and blue
Go ahead get lazy
You've paid your dues
Give yourself and I owe you
I'm chillin' (round and round it's sunny)
Just kick back (just chillin') let your blues fade away
And you can join me if you're willing
I'm chillin' (I don't want no honey)
Just loose it (just chillin') it's a beautiful day
Sometimes doing nothing can be thrilling
I'm chillin' (I'm chillin')
