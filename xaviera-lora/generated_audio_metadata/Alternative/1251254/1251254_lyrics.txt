Waking up to morning light, seeing you feels so right
Day and night you're on my mind, in your eyes truth I find
Stay close to me, don't let go
Stay close to me, feel the glow
With your skies leather grey
You chase all my fears away
Stay close to me, don't let go
Stay close to me, feel the glow
You're also fine my home
Never want to be alone
Day and night, you're on my mind
In your eyes, truth I'll find
Stay close to me, don't let go
Stay close to me, feel the glow
In your arms I'll find my home
Never want to be alone
In your arms I'll find my home
Never wanna be alone
Stay close to me, don't let go
Stay close to me, feel the blow
