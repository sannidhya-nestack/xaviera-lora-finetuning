She built her life by tearing it down
She taunted the monster that ate her
She smiled alone with crooked teeth
She flaunted what age would take away
Here now what's this strange little memory
Falling down around me
And I'll watch this strange little memory
Falling down, falling down around me
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
She found her beauty
By crawling through the mud
She wanted to soothe the ugliness
She lost her way
Along a shiny white line
She wanted to prove
Hear now what's this strange little memory calling down around me
She built her life by tearing it down
She taunted the monster that ate her
Here now was this strange little memory
Falling down
Here and now, what's this strange little memory
Falling down, falling down around me
