I'm paralyzed
There's something about you
And it makes my head spin
That's the scary part
Surrendering to you
So I let my guard down (I won't let you handle it)
Heart beats faster (you're in charge of it)
My senses fail me (can't make sense of it)
This weakness for you
Consumed by you
Losing control (oh oh oh)
Now ooh ooh
Losing control (oh oh oh)
Now ooh ooh
And I like it
Ooh, and I like it
Ooh, losing control
And I like it
I'm petrified
I shouldn't have come here
It's just a matter of time now
Until I'm lost in you
It's practically voodoo
So I let my guard down (let you handle it)
Heart beats harder (you're rechargeable)
My senses fail me (can't make sense of it)
I'm hopeless for you
Crashing towards you
Losing control
Losin' control, and I like it, and I like it
Losin' control, and I like it
I'm so high
Out my mind
I'm so high
Out my mind
Losing control
Losing control
And I like it
And I like it
So I'm losing control (losing control)
So I'm losing control (yeah) (control)
So I let my heart go
And I like it
So I let my heart go, let you handle it
