It's early at the laboratory
Already solved a thousand problems
But you are posing a conundrum
Don't even know where to begin you see
I am a rocket scientist
But I still can't figure you out
I have these PhD's and yet
I still can't figure you out
A rocket ship is made up of equations
Comprised consistently of many formulas
But when I try to discover what you're thinking
I throw out the formulas, go back and start again
I am a rocket scientist
But I still can't figure you out
I have these PhD's and yeah
I still can't figure you out
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Don't know what to do
I am so in love with you
And I should be getting closer to
Solving the mystery of you
Don't know what to do
I am so in love with you
And I should be getting closer to
Solving the mystery of you
You say left, I say right, doesn't matter who's wrong who's right
You say left, I say right, doesn't matter who's wrong who's right
You say left, I say right, doesn't matter who's wrong who's right
You say left, I say right, doesn't matter who's wrong who's right
I am a rocket scientist
But I still can't figure you out
I have these PhD's and yet
I still can't figure you out
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
I still can't figure you out
Na na na na na na na
I still can't figure you
I am a rocket scientist (Clearly left, definitely right)
But I still can't figure you out
I have these PhD's and yeah (Doesn't matter who's wrong's right)
I still can't figure you out
