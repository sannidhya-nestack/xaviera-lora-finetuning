Come down to my house, I've got everything to be discovered
You won't go without when you're in my house
And every single way some days is strange (da da da da)
It's like everything is watching over me since you first came
They say no no no no no no
It's so much better now
We're so much closer now
So many voices now
And every night they all say to me
Get out
I don't know what you're doing now
I don't know what you got planned
But I don't like where it's heading to
Heading to
Get out
I don't know what you're doing now
I don't know what you got planned but
You don't look scared
Get on the highway away from my demon affair
Something has changed
You're not the same as when you first stayed over
Some kind of pain falling over you
Oh what can I do?
Things move around
And I don't understand, you're so blasé about it
Do you hear that sound? It's saying
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Dreamed of a better life
Away from where troubles ride
But too many voices now
And every night they all say to me
Get out!
I don't know what you're doing now
I don't know what you got planned
But I don't like where it's heading to
Heading to
Get out!
I don't know what you're doing now
I don't know what you got planned but
You don't look scared
Get out of my way away from my demon affair
I was left a house in my possession
In a wheel with a confession
And I could not opt out
Da da da da da da da
When I tried to tell the world about it
Spirits came and they won't allow it
They all came in three
And in the chorus they all said to me
Get out
You don't know what you're into now
We don't know what you got planned but
You won't like where it's heading to
Heading to
Get out
You don't know what you're into now
We don't know what you got planned but
You should be scared
Get out of my way away from my demon affair
Get out of my way away from my demon affair
Get out of my way away from my demon affair
