I have to separate from your plight
You need to comply
Cause you know I'll put up a fight
And I've found a new way to live
And you know I'll never change your mind
Cause I've tried
She's just a star lit in disguise
Pass somebody down the line
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be innocent
She's just a star lit in disguise
Hacked her tiptoe through lies
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be innocent
Innocent
Innocent
Innocent
I have to separate from your plight
You need to comply
you know I'll put up a fight
She's just a starlet in disguise
Passed on by down the line
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be innocent
She's just a starlet in disguise
Have to tiptoe through the lights
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be innocent
There's only subtleties pressing out
There's only subtleties pressing out
There's only subtleties
Only subtleties
She's just a starlet in disguise
Passed on by down the line
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be in the sun
She's just a star lit in disguise
Have to tiptoe through the lies
I'll never sacrifice my pride
My love will always be innocent
