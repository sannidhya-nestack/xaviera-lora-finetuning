Finding it in the back of your mind
It kept you alive
In the corner of your eye
I know, I know you're hiding under
You're hiding underneath
You cover it up and hide it under
And hide it underneath
But I can hear, I can hear you calling out
Through the walls you held inside
And I'll pull every corner home, all alone
You've let it go from the palm of your hand
You've lost control of the composure of your mind
But I know, I know you're hiding under, you're hiding underneath
You're covering up and hiding under and hiding underneath
I can hear you calling out
Through the walls you're held inside
And I pull every corner on
in my eyes the only thing keeping you down
Is your own doubting heart
And I pull every brick away, away
Sometimes doubting hearts
Take a fall and leave the fit
From our broken bones
Can repair in perfect form
I know, I know, you're hiding under, you're hiding underneath
We're covering up and hiding under, and hiding underneath
But I can't hear out
I can hear you calling out
Through the walls you're held inside
And I'll prove every corner wrong
in my eyes the only thing keeping you down
Is your own doubting heart
And I'll throw every brick away, away
