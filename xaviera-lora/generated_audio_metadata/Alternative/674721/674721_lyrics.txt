Your traveling days are full of romance
Saying goodbye to sweet oceans
Muses come and muses go
And that's just life the way it goes
You've loved and lost, you were lost and found
You've lost control but never down and out
Saved by hope and saved by stars
Saved by them, you know who they are
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, what a feeling
You came you saw, followed on by
Seen it all, said your goodbyes
That's self improved, you know who you are
Thoughts make us true and chicks did scars
Kept a low profile, kept a nose to the ground
Kept it simple and real, it was all about sound
Singing the truth and saying it right
Face it your soul, this is your life
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die
Now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
Set these words on fire
Set these words on fire
Set these words on fire
Set these words on fire
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
Now I can die, now I can die, now I can die, what a feeling
