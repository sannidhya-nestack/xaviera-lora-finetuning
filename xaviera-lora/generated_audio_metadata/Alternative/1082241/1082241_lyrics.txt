Wish I could stay with you
Wish you could say love you
I don't wanna lie no more
You don't wanna fight no more
'Cause you and I, it's like a ride
But we can't paint our love
I don't wanna lie no more
You don't wanna fight no more
'Cause you and I, black and white, we can paint our life
Mix ourselves with every move, good fool
Don't know
Don't know who
Don't know
Don't know who
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
