You start my fire, you burn it out
You turn my faith into a shadow of a doubt
All your desire has lost control
The darkness closes in on your otten soul
You torch the fortress in my heart
You torch the fortress in my heart
Extreme confusion
Your crow has flown
The inspiration of your hate becomes unknown
All terrorizing, trouble-lad
Just pull your eyes out in my trusting arms instead
You torch the fortress in my arms
You torch the fortress in my heart
You start my fire, you burn it out
You turn my faith into a shadow of a doubt
All terrorizing, troubling
Just pull your eyes out in my trusting arms instead
You torch the fortress in my heart
You torch the fortress in my heart
You torch the fortress in my heart
You torch the fortress in my heart
