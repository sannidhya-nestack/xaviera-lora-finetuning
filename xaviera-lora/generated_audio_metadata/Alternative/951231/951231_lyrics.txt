A dollar bill that says I'm right
I'm worth more in the afterlife
So bring the car around my back
And don't et my heart attack
Cause everything's gonna be alright
Amen sign on a broken line
Why's the future far away?
Pushed it into yesterday
We'll be dead in a box one day
Six feet beneath the rain
So what's the point in all of us?
If everything will turn to dust
I'm standing on your shoulders now
I never know the way back down
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Build me up watch me fight
First silicon dream in the afterlife
Move along and don't look back
Always had a way with that
Everything's gonna be alright
Amen sign on a broken line
Watch the future fall away
Pushed it into yesterday
We'll be dead in a box one day
Six feet beneath the rain
So what's the point in all of us
If everything will turn to dust
I'm standing on your shoulders now
I'll never know the way back down
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll be dead in a box one day
Six feet beneath the rain
So what's the point in all of us
If everything'll turn to dust
I'm standing on your shoulders now
I never know the way back down
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
