She's a ballet dancer and a thief
A romancer of the lost and swift of feet
And I'm Tyrone walking on a wire
Dying embers of a fire beneath my feet
Please don't offer me love
I don't need it
Please don't offer me love
It can't be happening near me
Does I start to dread
I shift my conscience to another state of mind
One that doesn't mind as much as mine
Sheets of publication you can read
Our temptation I don't need to know because
And I'm tired of walking on a line
I won't go back a second time to where I was
Please don't offer me your love
I don't need it
Please don't offer me your love
I can't be having it near me
Does I start to drift
I shift my conscience to another state of mind
One that doesn't mind as much as mine
Can't be done
Now it's all gone wrong
Just tell her how you felt
Like butter on a melt
You're a dirty girl who saved me from myself
Please don't offer me love
I don't need it and
Please don't offer me love
There can't be a villain near me
Does I start to dread
I shift my conscience to another state of mind
One that doesn't mind as much as mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
