Taking roads to nowhere can feel strange
But sometimes we detach ourselves and change
Now that I find myself in that zone I feel controlled
Shedding the fire of my younger soul
Now I've got time to breathe
Chasing down the truth can lead to blame
I'm making an excuse to shield the pain
Now that I find myself in that zone, I feel controlled
Shedding the fire of my younger soul was the long road
Now I've got time to breathe
It's nothing like the taste of rain when it's been laced with failure
Only something's gotta change, you're stuck there in the way, persuasive you're breaking down
I bet I can make you smile on your darkest day
I bet I can make you smile on your darkest day
I've been heading nowhere
Mentally
You don't even notice
Eventually
I can feel that pain
That you're meant to show
Keep your faith
When your gut sends cold
Keep your faith when your gut sends code
Yeah I made mistakes but I meant it most
Keep your faith when your gut sends code
Yeah I made mistakes
