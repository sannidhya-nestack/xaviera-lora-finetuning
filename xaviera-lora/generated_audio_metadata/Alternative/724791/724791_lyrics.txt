I've been running down this sidewalk
For hours and hours and hours
I've been hoping that we could talk
About this little life of ours
Seems it doesn't matter how hard we try, we
Keep slipping down these cracks
We climb and climb but never reach the
The peak we're aiming at
Maybe we can turn it back
It's a heavy cross to carry
So Mike and Katie say
It's something that I'd like to bury
Would I wear another way?
But sometimes when I sigh it out loud, I can almost float away
It's then my breathing finally slows down and I can face the day
I know we can turn it back
Into everything we've wanted to be
Into everything we've wanted to be
