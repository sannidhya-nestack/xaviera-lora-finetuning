You will always be mine
That's the dream that I had
How could I ever be wrong?
After the things we shared
They say time will heal wounds
Mine will go away
They get bigger and bigger
Bigger with each passing day
It is hard to realize
That I've waited too long and let go
What I thought used to be so strong
With my heart in your hands
And fear in my head
In the end you are the best thing that I ever had
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
There's only cold wind now rushing over my skin
Hope lost, light has never been so frightening
Another day, another chance, feel free to change
Sometimes you need to walk alone just to know that you can
I didn't know what I wanted but I don't want this
The picture perfect memory of our last kiss
We were so close, so far
It has torn us apart
So close, so far
It has torn us apart
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
You used to have all the answers
Now I am searching for them on my own
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
