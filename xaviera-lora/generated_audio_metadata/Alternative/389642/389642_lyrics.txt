Drown, drown
Drown, drown
Disappearing, disappearing
Drown, drown, suffocating nowhere
Underwater nowhere
Drown, drown, suffocating nowhere
Sacrifice my soul to you
And you know that
I need you, so give me something I can do
But you just take and rip away until it's over
I've been waiting for so long
Finally found out what went wrong
Listen closely and you will hear
That it is over right now (Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't)
(Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't)
Wasted
She told you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
She told you down, down, down, down down down
They love you
Drown drown suffocating nowhere
Sun was far under water nowhere
Drown drown suffocating nowhere
Underwater nowhere
Lie your head down thoughts gone soon
On a blanket in your womb
Rubs into fire and comes so clear
Face head over
Drifting out out into sea
Looking glass clear for me
Glancing slowly for some room
To bang on else solidly room
It's all over, can't you see?
I've given you all of me
So scratch until you dig away
All of the venom from your vein
I can't help you
Can't you see that it is over?
Don't you know it's over?
Don't you know it's over?
Don't you know it's over?
Drown, drown, suffocate in nowhere
Sacrifice on the water now and
Drown, drown, suffocating now and
Underwater nowhere
Drown drown suffocating nowhere
Underwater nowhere
Drown drown suffocating nowhere
Underwater nowhere
Drown, drown, suffocating nowhere
Sacrifice my soul to you
Sacrifice my soul to you
Drown, drown, suffocating nowhere
Sacrifice my soul to you
Underwater nowhere
Drown, drown, suffocating nowhere
Sacrifice my soul to you
