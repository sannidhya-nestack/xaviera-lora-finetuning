Ever lasted way too long I need a change of scene
Speaking in an unknown language I don't know what you mean
Trying to run while my legs are numb
Can't tell if it's a dream
And I can't tell the real from fiction or where I'd rather be
I'll never come back home
Gonna dance in the street on my own
I thought that things would follow up with something more
Then everything you said was nothing more
Then words you just decided to speak
But what do they actually mean?
Memories I can't let go of stuck right in the way
Hiding things I cannot show
I'm checked out for the day
Hard to see all the colours now
That I'm only seeing grey
And I ot all the reasons that I have for me to stay
I'll never come back home
Gonna dance in the street on my own
I thought that things would follow up with something more
Then everything you said was nothing more
Than words you just decided to speak
But what do they actually mean?
I can't see more than a word and nothing less
It's nothing that I haven't heard before
Now that I can finally see
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
I'm in your state
Tell me what am I chasing?
Got nothing to take
it's already taken
I thought that things would follow up with something more
Then everything you said was nothing more
Than words you just decided to speak
But what does it actually mean?
I can't think with no words, nothing less
It's nothing that I have ever before
And now that I can finally see
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
