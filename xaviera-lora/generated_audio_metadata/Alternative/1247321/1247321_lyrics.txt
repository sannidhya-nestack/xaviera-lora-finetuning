Brass up
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yo, I'm walking through the city with a chip on my shoulder
Eyes cold as ice world getting colder
Life's a battlefield and I'm a soldier
Getting upset but still I'm getting bolder
Getting upset, can't keep it inside and just analyze
Gotta take it in stride
From the streets to the beats we ride
Getting upset but still we rise
Lost in the chaos trying to find peace
Everyday's a struggle never finding release
Hustle through the pain hoping for a cease
Getting upset but I won't decrease
Lost in the chaos trying to find peace
Everyday's a struggle never find a release
Hustle through the pain hoping for a cease
Getting upset but I won't decrease
Living in the shadows where the light don't reach
Lessons of the streets what the wise ones teach
Anger in my heart but the truth I preach
Getting upset but I'm out of the breach
Getting upset, can't keep it inside
In this pain we're life, gotta take it in stride
From the streets to the beats we ride
Getting upset, but still we ride
Living in the shadows where the light don't reach
Lessons of the streets, what the wise ones teach
Anger in my heart, but the truth I preach
Getting upset, but I'm out of the breach
In the midst I can't keep it inside
In this game of life gotta take it in stride
From the streets to the beach we ride
Getting upset but still we rise
In the midst of the storm we find our way
Getting upset but we live another day
Strengthen our hearts as we fight and pray
Getting upset but we won't decay
