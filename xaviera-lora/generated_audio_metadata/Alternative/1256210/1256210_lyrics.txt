In the night so bright
Star elevates, she walks with light
A mystery she create
Queens of dreams, she's on the scene
Fires up the stage, a wild machine
Fiji, Fiji, Fiji, her metro proud
Beneath her starlit sky she moves so loud
With eyes that gleam, a haunting beam
In her rhythm flow you join the stream
Dreaming deeper
Ignorance
In her soul
Oh
Hot lady
Her fire
Takes control
No
Dreaming deeper
You make me, I wanna make it
Oh, how I made it, feel, feel fine
Egoante, her sweet refrain
Every dance she makes, breaks the chain
Luna Lux, her fame does grow
In the night, she's the show
Soul Whistle
Resist her captivating dance
Baby I never called so clear
In her world you lose your fear
Oh, dreamy diva
Being kissed in her soul
Oh, her lady, fire
Oh, no, dreaming for me, I'm dreaming
Oh, how I've made it, feel, feel fine
For our world, world, world
