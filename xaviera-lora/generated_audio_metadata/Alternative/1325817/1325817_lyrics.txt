They create the rules that don't make any sense for them it's all the same
They take a look at the damage and they still insist that it's not what it seems
The same ones tell you that it's all a big lie
They won't admit they're wrong
Just take a look at the damage and you'll see
That they're not what they seem
And they will be waiting on the dark side
And they will be making up the wrong minds
And they will be starting all the wildfires
And they will be taking us all down with them
They are ignorant and they are evil but they are not insane
The crazy ones are the people who sit back and think that they're not what they seem
When they tell you that you need to give up on everything you love
When they tell you that there's nothing you can do
Just take a look at the damage
And they will be waiting on the dark side
And they will be making up the wrong minds
And they will be starting all the wildfires
And they will be taking us all down with them
Oh oh oh oh
They create the rules that don't make any sense for them it's all the same
They take a look at the damage
And they still insist that it's not what it seems (oh, oh)
They will be waiting on the dark side and they will be making up the wrong minds
And they will be starting all the wildfires and they will be taking us all down with them
They will be waiting on the dark side and they will be making up the wrong minds
And they will be starting all the wildfires and they will be taking us all down with them
