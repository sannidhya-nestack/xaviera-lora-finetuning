It's been more than this, more than this for years and more
And probably a week or two ago
The endless cycle bliss
The blissful words to follow yours
And my arms were wide open
But you wanted more
But you needed more
But you wanted more
But not the kind that I was giving
Iron out the blood
The blood that stains the ties of living
It's easy to believe in social goals
Contribute to my pulse
And make your best loud and true
But you wanted more
But you needed more
But you wanted more
But not the kind that I was giving
Why even bother wall-to-wall?
Brick by brick, bring the whole thing down
It's fire with fire, miles for miles, sinking sense of sound
