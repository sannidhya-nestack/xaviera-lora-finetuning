A warm judgment, well, here it is, here.
Ripping through your soul, a desire to be out of control
How does she feel tonight? Tossing genders, feeling out of sight
Trying to possess what her mother seemed to et
On a seesaw animating, Christian soul not hesitating
No need for education
It's time for a liberation (Facing your fears)
I know your name and I've seen you
What you're gonna do so walk on through
I watch colors and I see you
What you're going through so walk on through
Walk on
Walk on
Go on, Jekyll and Hyde
Human conquest through space and time
Only hits at 2 o'clock
In magazines, looking for exoneration
Acts as though she's celebrated
Rising to the minor nation
Knocked down, no observation
Of what I see, I don't regret
I'm not your TV, TV-Pen
Ready for education (I'm gonna hear your lies)
It's time for liberation (Now if you're black don't look at mine)
I know your name and I've seen you
What you're gonna do so walk on through
I've watched colors and I've seen you
What you're going through so walk on through
Listen, listen to my soul
This is what, what I've come to be (what I've come to be)
You convinced me that you ain't so cold (so cold, so cold)
I've got some individual, individuality
No need for education (you're a liar, you're a nice)
It's time for a liberation (no looking back, no looking back now)
You thrive on segregation
I know your name and I've seen you
What you're gonna do so walk on through
I watch colors and I see you
What you're going through so walk on through
What? What?
WHAT? NO!
