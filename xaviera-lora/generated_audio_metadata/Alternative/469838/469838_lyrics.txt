Ooh girl when you do that thing
The way you shake, shimmy and you swing
You know it's always gonna bring me around
Ooh little girl I like the way you move
The way you move
Ooh girl when you move around
There's a certain thing that I found
It never never brings me down
Can't you see
Ooh little girl I like the way you move
Ooh, little girl, I like the way you move
I like the silly things you say and do
I like the way you look from across the room
Ooh, girl, when you move around
There's a certain thing that I found
It never, never brings me down
Can't you see?
Ooh, little girl, I like the way you move
Ooh, little girl, I like the way you move
