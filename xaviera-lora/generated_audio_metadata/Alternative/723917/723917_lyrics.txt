Listen to me, I believe our time is up
Unless you prove me wrong, then this love's corrupt
You're never home, that which is my heart
This barren land
You've chosen not to roam
I've tried to give you my company
But I see that's something you won't accept
What you see is shaped by your beliefs
I wish I believed in us except
I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright though I'm not sober
I'm drowning in this misery
So God please set me free
God please set me free
I'll beg of you as I watch my bitterness flow
Just take my hand and allow our love to grow
This is the hardest I've fallen, now surrounded by gloom
I'd much rather you be here to help cure these wounds
I'm lying in this half dead coma waiting for my heart to beat
I feel it's though I've dug my final home in the back of love's retreat
I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright though I'm not sober
I'm drowning in this misery
So won't you set me free
Please set me free from this
I know what I believe, she hates what I see
So please, won't you save me
And release me from this
I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel alright though I'm not sober
Yeah I'm drowning in this misery
So God please free me
I already know that it's over
So I'll try my best not to make believe
I feel like hell, I'm far from sober
Yeah, I'm drowning in this misery
So God please free me
