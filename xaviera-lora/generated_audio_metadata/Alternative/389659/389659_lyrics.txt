It's all about keeping the pain at bay, now you've gone away
It's all about keeping the pain at bay
Now you've gone away
There's no need to be alone
There's no need to be alone
Why aren't you with me?
Why did you leave me?
Separation's clear
What will we call living without you?
You have tried hard now to beat us, to beat us
Curled up like a dead fetus, a dead fetus
I still need help in your heart
But there's a need up in your heart
Yeah there's a need up in your heart
Why aren't you with me?
Why did you leave me?
We're still here
Separation's clear
While we're awake, oh
Living without you
We're still here
Separation's clear
While we're awake and living without you
We're still here, separation's fair
While we're awake and living without you
We're still here, separation's clear
