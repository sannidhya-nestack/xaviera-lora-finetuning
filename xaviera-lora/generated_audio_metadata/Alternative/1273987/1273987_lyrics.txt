War drums high, but I'm still here
Running on faith and a little fear
I've been knocked down, never once
But I got strength where it counts
The fight ain't over, I won't back down
There's always room for one more round
One more round
Pour a drink and throw it down
And come back up for one more round
I'll pull my head together, I'm still standing
Every scar's a story worth demanding
Through the highs, through the lows, I'll rise again
One more round, I'm in it to win
The fight ain't over, won't back down
There's always room for one more round, one
More, round, pour a drink and throw it down
And I'll let go for one more round
I pull my head together, I'm still standing
Every scars is a story worth demanding
Through the highs, through the lows, I'll rise again
One more round, I'm in it to win
The fight ain't over, won't back down
There's always room for one more round, one
More round
Pour a drink and throw it down
And come back up for one more round
No more second guessing, I'm owning my fate
Each bruise a reminder, it's never too late
Through the fire inside me, it's burning bright
I'll keep on swinging with all my might
People talk, but they don't know
How hard it is to let it all show
I've stumbled, I've tripped, but I won't fall
Even when I'm up against a wall
I've taken the hits, I've won the pain
But I'm still standing, I've risen above the flames
Every round I've fought, every fall I've made
Has led me to this moment where I'm unafraid
The fight ain't over, won't back down
There's always room for one more round to run
More round, pour the drink and throw it down
And come back up for one more round, one more round
