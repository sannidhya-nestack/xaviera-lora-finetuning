Wake up in the morning and kiss me slowly
You save me from my loneliness
Save me from my loneliness
Wake up in the morning and say
Won't you kiss me slowly?
Save me from my loneliness
Save me from, save me from, save me from
Save me from, save me from my loneliness
Don't let go, don't let go
Wake up in the morning, then you kiss me slowly
You save me from my loneliness
Save me from my loneliness
Wake up in the morning and say
When you kiss me slowly, babe
You save me from my loneliness
Save me from, save me from, save me from
Save me from, save me from my loneliness
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
