Lately I've been sitting here just thinking
The life I lead has gotta be a drag
Punching all these buttons on computers
Windows 95 just take my bag
Getting up so early in the morning
One more pop art's gonna make me gag
Getting home so late in the evening
Just to watch TV with the old nag
Friday thumbs and then it's time for freedom
Freedom just to mow and rake and weed'em
I wish I had a son to cut the lawn
So I could watch the football game and yawn
Then I'll fire up the barbecue
And show'em what suburban men can do
But hopefully someday I will reform
And a wig on cat will be reborn
Yeah, I wanna be a rockstar
Rockabilly rebel, I wanna dance and drag and drive away tonight
I wanna tell all the schools, the rockabilly rules
If they don't like it, then we'll have to fight
I'm gonna quit my job, join a rockabilly mob
Now that I have finally seen the light
Or maybe I'll find work as a rock and soul jerk
Or maybe I'll go cruising on my bike
Gonna quit my job and join a rockabilly mob
And make a rockin' change up in my life
I'm gonna get a guitar and a hot rod car
And maybe even get a brand new wife
I'll fill my hair with grease so I can lose the police
When they try and take my switchblade knife
Yeah, I'm freakin' free and I'm bound to be
The coolest thing around since Barney Pyfe
Yeah, I wanna be a rockabilly rebel
I wanna dance and drag and drive away the night
I wanna tell all the schools
The rockabilly rules
And if they don't like it, then we'll have to fight
I'm gonna quit my job and join a rock-filling mob
Now that I have finally seen the light
Or maybe I'll find work as a rocket soda jerk
Or maybe I'll go cruising on my bike
Yeah, I'm gonna find some work as a rocket soda jerk
And then I'll go cruising on my bike
