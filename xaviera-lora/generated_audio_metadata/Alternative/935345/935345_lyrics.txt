I've got a colour in my mind
I've got a colour in my mind
Welcoming this sunny light
Overshadowing black and white
I've got lost in the humming sound
I've got lost but I will be found
We've got time and I lost count
That's what happens when you're around
I just want to stay inside
While orange curtains hold me tight
I don't have to look outside
orange curtains make us sunny
Light
All of the other days I'm awake
All of the other days I'm awake
Here with you I'll watch you make me et what's at stake
I just want to stay inside
While orange curtains hold me tight
I don't have to look outside
orange curtains make us sunny
I've got a colour in my mind
I've got a colour in my mind
