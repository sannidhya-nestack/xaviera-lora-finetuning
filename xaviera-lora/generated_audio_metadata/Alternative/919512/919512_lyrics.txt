Every morning I feel a little sick
Like the dead of night crawl beneath my skin
But then I think of you
And my skies lose their gloom
you're the sunshine in my
Melancholy mind
Glistening in the dark
You're the sunshine in my
Melancholy mind
Dancing in my thoughts
Illuminating, you keep me ruminating
On your soul trees shine, lustfully intoxicating
Oh as long as I think of you
I'll stay yearning, I'll stay subdued
you're the sunshine in my
Melancholy mind
Glistening in the dark
You're the sunshine in my
Melancholy mind
Dancing in the thoughts
Oh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
