There's nothing you can tell a fool
That'll make him change his point of view
Everybody knows it but no one knows what they can do
So reading all the words a fool
Thinking all the world needs their point of view
A man's gotta do what every man's gotta do
Oh, everybody knows it's true
Oh, a happy song will see you through
But oh, some things
Be singing the same words they do but to a different tune
So turning up on the round day
The fool gets both barrels in the fray
A verbal guided missile blast to make him go away
But all it does is make the fool carry on as if all he says is true
Not a jot has changed the fool still has his point of view
Oh, everybody knows it's true
Oh, a happy song will see it through
But oh, someday
He's singing the same words they do but to a different tune
Well, oh, everybody knows
It's true, everybody knows
The fools can't help themselves
Along with everyone else
Their minds made up
There's nothing you can say that helps
Oh, everybody knows it's true
Oh, a happy song will see you through
But oh, some days
You're singing the same words they do but to a different tune
But oh, oh, some days
You're singing the same words they do but to a different tune
