My head hurts, I'm hungry
I miss you, feel empty
I own these lungs, I own these bones
Everything I need to carry me home
I'm not the type to stand still
I'm not the type to slow down
I'm not the type to stop until I'm falling down, yeah
Slowly rises to make me cry
Softly it whispers, "Run girl, run"
Yeah, run girl, run
I dream this trail, I dream these woods
Everything I need to be who I could
I'm not the type to give up
I'm not the type to slow down
I'm not the type to stop until I'm falling down, yeah
Slowly it rises to make me fall, yeah
Softly it whispers, "Run girl, run"
Yeah, run girl run
Feed myself up
Feed
Don't need to beat you up (You know it's not easy)
Don't need to beat you up (To say goodbye)
Don't need to beat you up (You know it's not easy)
Don't need to beat you up (To say goodbye)
My head hurts
I'm hungry, I miss you, feel empty
I own these lungs, I own these bones
Everything I need to carry me home
I'm not the type to stand still
I'm not the type to slow down
I'm not the type to stop until I'm falling down, yeah
Slowly it rises to meet me ground, yeah
Softly it whispers
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run
Run girl run, yeah
