I see the sun rise in your eyes
Shining over moonlit dusk
And if tomorrow never comes
Well I guess that's just our luck
I see the light behind your eyes
Dancing through the pouring rain
I'll walk the earth a thousand times
Just to see your face again
Life's too short but the road is long
But it ain't so bad when you're alone
So let's play dress up and let's chase scenes
Put on your makeup and let's throw a skid until sunrise
Until sunrise
But I see the darkness in your eyes
Shining across church house beds
And I'll kiss you in the next life
You have stars inside your head
Because when your wonders hurt this world
You create water from the wine
So I guess I'll deal with our boys and our girls
And I'll see you on the other side
Life's too short but the road is long
But it ain't so bad when you're alone
So let's play dress up and let's chase sins
Put on your make up and let's throw skins until sunrise
Until sunrise
In the astral hush behind your eyes
I surrender to your cosmic sighs
Tracing stars from restless dreams
I think of you and all your schemes
In those moments when I lost or found
I cherish those as most go down
The morning always comes so soon
But we can start all over again
Sometimes I lose myself in the hutch before the dawn
Memories echo louder than any spoken word
But I still feel your pulse
Running through my veins
Because life's too short but the road is long
It ain't so bad when you're alone
So let's play dress up and let's chase sins
Put on your makeup and let's throw skins until sunrise
Until sunrise
Until sunrise
Until sunrise
