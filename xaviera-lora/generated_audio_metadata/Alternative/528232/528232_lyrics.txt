I talk a lot just to keep her happy
She enjoys listening to me
I drink sometimes but she never joins me
Guess it's not a cup of tea
She smiles a lot and I keep each one of them
Catalog inside my head
sometimes she yells
And I should be listening
But I'm looking at her smiles instead
Oh, I try so hard to do the things
I know that I'm supposed to do
And through all the frustration she stays with me
Hoping one day I'll come through
I am so in love
With everything she does
And I wake up every day
To hear the words she has to say
Although I may not understand
I know that I'm a lucky man
But I hope that I am not the only one
The only lucky one
She laughs at me sometimes when I'm talking
When I'm not trying to entertain
But I love the sound of her mischievous giggle
So I don't ever want to complain
When she looks at me and she tells me she loves me
I struggle through a clever reply
And I hope she does
But sometimes I wonder
Is she living or just getting by?
Oh I try so hard to do the things
I know that I'm supposed to do
And through all the frustration she stays with me
Hoping one day it'll all come through
I am so in love
With everything she does
And I wake up everyday
To hear the words she has to say
Although I may not understand
I know that I'm a lucky man
But I hope that I am not the only one
The only loved one
I don't really know what she sees in me
Maybe she's afraid to be alone
Maybe this is just my insecurity
Or maybe I'm right
I hope I'm not right
I think a lot about every moment
We spend together holding hands
And she's changed my life and all for the better
In ways she'll never understand
I am so in love with everything she does
And I wake up everyday to hear the words she has to say
Although I may not understand
I know that I'm a lucky man
And I hope that I am not the only one
The only lucky one
I am so in love
With everything she does
And I wake up everyday
To hear the words she has to say
Although I may not understand
I know that I'm a lucky man
And I hope that I am not the only one
The only lucky one
