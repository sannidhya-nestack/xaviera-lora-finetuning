You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
Angels whisper near
Souls with voices clear
Heard in distant waves
This is what remains
You're all I want, yes, you're all my mind
You're all I want
Yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want
Yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want
Yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I want, yes, you're on my mind
You're all I know, yes, you're all my mind
Angels whisper near
Souls with voices clear
Heard in distant waves
Peace is what remains
Lord, when you hear my name
You know angels dance and play
Dreams moving through the days
Carried on the wings of time will stay
