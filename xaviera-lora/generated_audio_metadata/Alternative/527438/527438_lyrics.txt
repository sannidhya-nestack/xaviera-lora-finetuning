The sun's turning purple, the Venus declines
Leaving glints on a bitter cloud nine
Your smoke's drawing circles, it won't ease my mind
When all your words of wisdom lose rhyme
There's no easy way out
I'm smothered in doubt
When love converts to merely past tense
Left my heart in your clouds
It's lost in the crowd
All you can give me is the start of an end
I'd die for the pearl, a fond shell filled with light
Even the brightest gem still needs light to shine
My dreams been blurred by nicotine skies
My wings are broken and it's hard to fly blind
There's no easy way out
I'm smothered in doubt
When love converts to merely past tense
Lost my heart in your clouds
It's lost in the crowd
All you can give me is the start of an end
Where's my picture perfect?
Where's my Hollywood ending now?
It's just not possible stayin' friend
'Cause I wouldn't get my start over now
There's no easy way out
All that I want is the start of an end
There's no easy way out
(It's the start of a brand new day)
(There's no easy way out)
Where's my picture perfect?
Where's my Hollywood ending now?
(There's no easy way out)
It's my third and last
There's no easy way out of here (There's no easy way out)
Just give me, please, the start of an end
The start of an end (There's no easy way out)
The stuff I've been in, oh
