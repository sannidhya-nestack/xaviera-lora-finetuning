Lose your head for days in a makeshift maze
That you made for the sake of escaping
Fear locks your gaze as you stop to brace
It's hypnotic, I dare you to not give in
I pawn my soul in the meantime
And keep the sinners on my side
I walk in awe of the streetlight
Lock yourself in chains, only hell remains
All your patience is wasted, you're waiting
Teardrops like rain down your washed out face
Taste so toxic, I dare you to not give in
Pour my soul in the meantime
And keep the sinners on my side
I walk it all with the street light
I embrace all the sins you encase
I'm the truth unshaken
The youth you could not contain
Don't be afraid
I've been mixing up my days
I've been tripping out my brains
But don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me, don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me, don't fear for now
Don't fear for me, don't fear for now
Drop your guns, don't aim
Know that the sun won't stay here
Stick around for no man or blind faith
There's a gentle silence within the violence
So sit down and re-evaluate
I embrace all the sins you encase
I'm the truth unshaken
The youth you could not contain
Don't be afraid
I've been mixing up my days
I've been tripping out my brains
But don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me
Don't fear for me now
Don't fear for me, don't fear for me now
