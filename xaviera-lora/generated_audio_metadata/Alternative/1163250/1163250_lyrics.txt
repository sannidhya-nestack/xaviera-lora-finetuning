You're getting by, you play it cool
You're clearing out all that is best, a threat to you
Threads in your mind, cut it soon, yeah
You set your path without the traces, woah woah
You found your mark, you're in for the kill
There is no hide and face it, watch your guard, that is the thrill
So, you've just made yourself a fool, it's what you say now
Why don't you leave us alone?
So you should blame somebody soon
It's what you do best, yeah, it's always the same
Must be hard here at your throne
The king at last and no one knows
But you alone
Wore out your ties with everyone
Your contradictions prevail
A favorite to no one at all
You found your mark
You're in for the kill
There is no hiding, face it, watch your guard, that is the thrill
So you just made yourself a fool is what you say now
Why don't you leave us alone?
So you should blame somebody soon
It's what you do best
Yeah, it's always the same
You found your mark
You're in for the kill
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
You just made yourself a fool
It's what you say now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Why don't you leave us alone?
So you should bring somebody soon
It's so wrong
Yeah, it's always the same
