Eating blueberries one by one
Just before the sun spills out
Before midnight turns a corner
And kisses the sun
You are with me
You are with me
Together we eat till there's just one left
You insist I eat it all by myself
While you watch with purring eyes
I can see the corners of your mouth
Smile at me
You
You are with me, you are with me
I taste your desire
As you silently soak me in
You said no need to rush
We have'til forever
Oh, and you are with me
One of the time when the last drop falls
From the sky when the last seed sprouts before
Autumn opens its eyes
When I'm weathered and have otten your name
Sipping tea while our grandkids play
Are you with me still?
Are you with me still?
For the moment you came I never turned away
And I still have the wings of the butterfly who gave you all
With me
You always were since your words made a bed in my mind
And your kiss eclipsed mine
Your blueberry tongue tasted so sweet
I felt tangled right down to my feet
You nestled snugly in my soul
He is home, he is home
You are within me
Oh, you are within me
Mmm, and you are within me
Within me, within me, you are within me
