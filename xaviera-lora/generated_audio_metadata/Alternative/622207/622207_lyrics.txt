When I was a young boy, my father sat down
He said, "Boy, what will you do?"
I said, "Dad, don't you worry, I got this guitar
And I've got a song or two"
I went on out in this great big world
People greeted me with open arms
But time went by and they moved on
And my song went on too long
Mm mm mm mm mm
Yeah my song went on too long
Mm mm mm mm mm
Yeah my song went on too long
And I fell in love with a beautiful girl
She loved me from the start
We lay down in her big white bed
And there she took my heart
She gave me a child, another one too
As the years they went along
And then one day she went astray
my song went on too long
Mm-hmm, yeah my song went on too long
Mm-hmm, yeah my song went on too long
I stayed on out from the late night to dawn
Riding the highway low
Last night I was in another strange town
And the people all sang along
They smiled and they laughed
They filled up my cup
They loved the song I sung
But they all went home with each other, you know
And I loaded out alone in the rain
Mm-hmm, yeah, my song went on too long
Mm-hmm, yeah, my song went on too long
Well I'm pretty good at adding things up
It's not just the numbers I say
And I'm even better at this here guitar
And living the songs that I play
And after the last song has been sung
And the crowd's turned away from the stage
Well she's pretty, she's young and eager to please
But I've got nothing to say
Mm-hmm, yeah my song's gone on too long
Mm-hmm, yeah my song's gone on too long
Some way out, too long
Some way out, too long
Shut up! Just shut up already, I told you to shut up! Shut up!
