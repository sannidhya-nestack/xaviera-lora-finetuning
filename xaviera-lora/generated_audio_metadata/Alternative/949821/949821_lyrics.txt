You're making eyes with me across the table
To my surprise, I don't think you're able
To make me satisfied, I do appreciate your time
Give me a reason, I might jump off the deep end if you're mine
You're exchanging lines
With me across the sofa
I'm not surprised
You're not a supernova
I'm hard to satisfy
I do appreciate your time
I still need a reason
I might jump off the deep end if you're mine
I just might
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Don't go, your looks are magical
Show me the tricks you like to pull
I'll be a rabbit in your heart
I'll disappear in that design
Don't go, your looks are magical
You're making eyes
With me across the pool deck
Your expression lies
I can tell you're fooling
Me to make me feel
Like I could really seal the deal
I don't need a reason
I might jump off the deep end if you're mine
I just might
Ah, ah
