Well someday I would like to be loved
Or at least spoken highly of
But I guess I'll survive
If I don't get all that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
Well I would like to reach the mountain top
Let go of my fear and watch it drop
But I guess I'll survive
If I don't get all that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
I was told when I was young that life doesn't give you a choice
And there's not much in store
So be thankful for what you got
Don't make trouble and lower your voice
And don't go asking for more
But I can't help asking for more
I don't need to make money in piles
I'd trade it all for one of your smiles
But I guess I'll survive
If I don't get all that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
I was told when I was wet that this is till death do you part
But I stood my ground, yeah I may be miserable but I'm not yet dead
Still I got this hole in my heart and you're nowhere to be found
And I can't help wondering why you're not around
I don't need to make money in piles
I'd trade it all for one of your smiles
But I guess I'll survive if I don't get all that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
All that I'm asking
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
