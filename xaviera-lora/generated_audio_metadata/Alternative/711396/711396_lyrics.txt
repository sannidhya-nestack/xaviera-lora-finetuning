And the days gone by
And the months go by
And the dreams are done now
And the light shines on me
It's dawning upon me
But all I needed was you
It's clear as day that all I looked for was you
Sweet summer's here, and I want you, and I want you near
Sweet summer's here, and I want you, and I want you near
Sweet
And the music has gone by
And the notes faded away
And the chords are done now
The song still senses on me
It's turning up on me
That all I needed was you
It's clear as day that all I looked for was you
Sweet summer's here and I want you
And I want you near
Sweet summer's here
And I want you
And I want you near
Sweet summer's here
And I want you
And I want you near
You're all I'm here for
