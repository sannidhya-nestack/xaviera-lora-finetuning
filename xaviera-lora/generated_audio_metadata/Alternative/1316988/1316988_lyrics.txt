Fading colors in the night
Chasing echoes feelings ride
Flickering lights of your laughter
Moments captured the hereafter
Catch my breath this spiral dance together lost
In a trance, your horizons draw me closer
Found my heart beneath your poster
Dare to fall, let's take a ride
Through the maze, you by my side
Every heartbeat reads the signs
Time's a thief but love it binds
Whispers tangled in the breeze
Mysteries hide behind the trees
Diving deep, no looking back
Life unfolds on this wild track
Colors bleed into the dawn
Faded dreams that linger on
Waves of sound they lift me higher
In this moment we conspire
Dare to fall let's take a ride
Through the maze you by my side
Every heartbeat read the signs
Time's a thief but love it binds
Tie my dreams to your soul
Paint the stars let the truth unfold
We'll escape the weight of time
Find a place where love can shine
Dare to fall, let's take a ride
Through the maze, you by my side
Every heartbeat, read the signs
Time's a thief, but love it binds
