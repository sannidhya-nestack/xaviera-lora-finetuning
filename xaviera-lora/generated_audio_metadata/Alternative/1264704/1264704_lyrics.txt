I'm a solo in a tight spot, I'm making a jump to light speed
Ditching the script, I've got what you need
I'm a ghost in a machine, a glitch in the matrix code
Baby I'm going rogue, maybe just a bit of a heavy load
Baby I'm going rogue, maybe just a bit of a heavy load
Following a twist in winding road
Book the chain and off the grid
A maverick with a plan but nothing to forbid
I'm a rebel with a cause in everything I do
I'm going rogue, would you like to come too?
Like a secret agent, I'm the one who's been erased
A whisper in the shadows, a ghost in the machine's trace
I'll force a nature like a shark in a suit
I'm taking the leap, no need for a parachute
But baby, I'm going rogue
Maybe just a bit of a heavy load
Baby I'm going rogue
Maybe just a bit of a heavy load
I'm
Following a twist in winding road
I'm
Following a twist in winding road
But like a madman with a secret
I'm hiding in plain sight
I'm master of the universe
With a wing and a cigarette light
I've got a PhD in anarchy
From the university of mayhem
Under the twist of lemon
I'm going rogue
I'm going rogue
Nothing's gonna stop me
Stop me
Stop me
I'm going rogue
I'm going rogue
I'm going rogue
