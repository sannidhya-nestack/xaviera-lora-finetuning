And some of us have given up
Whether you're heading for a wedding or funeral
Hope springs eternal

Maybe it's time we call their bluff
'Cause you know baby when you get down to brass tacks
Here are the straight facts

I know you've had your fill of heartache
Threw up your hands and cried enough
It makes no difference if you're sane or you're crazy
Lonesome or lazy
