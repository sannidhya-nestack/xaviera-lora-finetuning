How do you deal with feelings you feel
That have no words to explain?
How do you handle the burning candle
That I lit in vain?
The pain of want, the pain of desire
The candles fire burning inside
The gushes around you that hold you, surround you
The rising M of the tide
Your voice in my head, I'd rather you here instead
Of miles so far away
The pain of want, the pain of desire
The candle's fire burning inside
Circumstance beyond either control
Made nothing with a quiet glance
Dreams of you every night
Unwilling to take flight
Oh how I long for the chase
Her music is calling like a silent song in the night breeze
The pain and longing brings me to my knees
There are no words
There are no answers
It's a feeling of longing as time goes on and on and on and on
Her music is calling like a siren song in the night breeze
The pain and longing brings me to my knees
There are no words
There are no answers
It's a feeling of longing
As time goes on and on and on and on and on
Allah Hu, Allah Hu, Allah Hu, Allah Hu
