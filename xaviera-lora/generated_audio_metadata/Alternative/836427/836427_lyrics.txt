Once again it rains against your window
Surrounded by clouds of dreams
I once believed with you next to me
Cause when I looked to the right I saw you by my side
You looked back at me from the passenger side
And maybe it's all on me
The way things should be with the story left on CD
With everything aside, would you still go for a ride?
Or would you let me drive away?
With the words of clichés that some people say
Or would you let things end this way?
Say
With your hair against the window
And my hand pressed against the wind
I try to slow us down
But it's useless
And I'll miss this
And I wish this story could play on forever and ever on repeat
And we'd make the distance to happier places with happier faces
With everything aside
Would you still go for a ride
Or would you let me drive away
With the words of clichés that some people say
Or would you let things end this way
Say
With everything aside, would you still go for a ride?
Or would you let me drive away?
With the words of clichés that some people say
Or would you let things end this way, say?
