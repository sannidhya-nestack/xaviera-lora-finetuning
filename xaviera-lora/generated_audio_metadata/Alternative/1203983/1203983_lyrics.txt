I want a new fortune
the tarot cards keep turning over blank
I don't wanna be tortured
each day it seems I'm walking off a plank
But somehow you make it all okay
You always know the perfect thing to say
One word
One simple truth, one touch and I'm lost inside of you
One chance, a dream that's great for two
One word that changes everything I knew
And what is you?
High, sweet as the sunrise
They calm the waters of my restless mind
You're always a surprise
Like a mystery never knowing what I'll find
You make all my worries go away
Seem to know the perfect thing to say
One word, one simple truth
One touch, and I'm lost inside of you
One chance, a dream that's made for two
One word that changes everything I knew
I just wanna hold you close
Never wanna let you go, no no no
Please stay, just say one word
One simple truth, one touch and I'm lost inside of you
One chance, a dream that's made for two
One word that changes everything I knew
You know that word is you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
