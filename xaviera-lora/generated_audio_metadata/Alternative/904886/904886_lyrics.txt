They sat across the kitchen table
Sentimentally incapable
Still trying to escape
A terrible fate
And she said, "You know it's funny
I'd offer you breakfast, but there isn't any"
Last night was great
But tomorrow is now today
It's good to go with your instincts
When you're not thinking
And she said, you know it's funny
I'd offer you breakfast but there isn't any
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
She makes good coffee
Algerian special, it's not a novelty
It's the love in the air, it's inclement
If only the weather was made of instruments, yeah yeah yeah
She said, you know it's funny
I'd offer you breakfast but there isn't any
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look mate, you should know the score
You haven't even won the battle, let alone the war
Feels like you're in a bad imitation Dylan song with a Samba beat
Well maybe that's where you went wrong
She said, you know it's funny
I'd offer you breakfast but there isn't any
