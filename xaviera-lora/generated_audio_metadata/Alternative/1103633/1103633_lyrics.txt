Lost, so lost
Wandering the city
Gone too soon
Mother Santa pity
Lost
Lost
Torchard sun
Wanna be with you tonight if I can
Down and out
The future is hiding the worst of the plan
Someday soon I'll rescue my heart, hold my head up and touch the sky
Given time I'ma fall apart, if the time is right I'm a dying man
And it's a bittersweet memory that's been here before
And you don't have to fight it after fighting anymore
More, more, more, more
I won't be lying
I won't be lying
There's no end, no end, no end
There's no end, no end, no end
Throw it together, the more you got
The more to lose this time around
The more to see you bittersweet
No, it's so bittersweet
Don't wanna be your fantasy
And it's a bittersweet memory that's been here before
And you don't have to fight it, have to fight it anymore (have to fight it)
More (have to fight it anymore)
I won't be lying
I won't be lying
There's no end, no end, no end
There's no end, no end, no end
It's so bittersweet
Don't wanna be your fantasy
No, it's so bittersweet
There's no end, no end, no end
There's no end, no end, no end
There's no end, no end, no end
There's no end, no end, no end
I won't be there
No end, no end, no end (I don't wanna be the same)
No end, no end, no end (I wanna be the same)
No end, no end, no end (I wanna be the same)
No end, no end
Oh, yeah
