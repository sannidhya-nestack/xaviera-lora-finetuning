Snowstorm, falling again
But my friends and I don't falter
Darkness can bring contemptuous suns
But sleepwalking is easy when you're under the good
Justify myself
Oh, freedom is so wild that I can't help
Black rain pouring down
Keep on moving, keep on moving
Fear inside keeps us dry
Must be the heat of hell for here no angels fly
Just if I might stare
To justify myself
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again
Take me, save me from my mother
Take me, save me from my brother
Take me, save me from my sister
Take me, save me from my mother
