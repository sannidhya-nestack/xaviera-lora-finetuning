Excuse me, I'm just trying to find my head
Confuse me
Sometimes I feel I might be better off, better off
It freaks me out
Tryna make sense in this mess
But when you make it out
And shake it off
Are you better off, better off?
Are you better off dead?
Am I better off, better off?
Or am I really alive instead?
All of this pain worth living for
If that doesn't break you
That's gonna make you
All of this pain worth living for
All of this pain worth for
If that doesn't break you
That's gonna make you
All of this pain worth living for
That's gonna make you
It's worth living for
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Excuse me, excuse me
I'm just trying to leave this way
Abuse me
Sometimes I feel like I can take it all
Take it all
But I won't stop believing
God help me, I can't stop believing
But I can't keep waking up to the feeling
To the feeling that I'm better off dead
Or am I better alive instead?
All this pain, what for?
That doesn't break you
That's gonna make you
All this
All this pain worth living's for
That's gonna wake you
That's gonna make you
All this pain worth for
If that doesn't break you
That's gonna make you
All this pain worth living's for
That's gonna wake you
All the pain is worth it
When you know you're worthy
All the pain is worth it
You know
All this pain, what for?
If that doesn't break you, that's gonna make you
All of this pain what for (all of this pain what for)
If that doesn't break you that's gonna make you (all of this pain what for)
It's worth your life (it's worth your life) it's worth your life (that's gonna make you)
All of this pain what for
If that doesn't break you that's gonna make you (all of this pain what for)
It's worth your life (it's worth your life) it's worth living for
