[Multicom Jingle]
Now the fun is over
And the work in plan begins
I don't know where I'm going
But who knows where I've been
I sit alone and waiting
On a one way street again
I see the exit sign and it's
Stop me breathing
Cause you're a million miles away
But still I hear you sayin'
We are gonna save the world
Together we can make it
I take this all upon yourselves (I take this all upon yourself)
And in all of you I trust
You're right here pull me over
We are gonna save the world
I sit alone and waiting
With someone who won't exist
It's still a phone I'm hating
On IM it never rings
I see you walk away from me
I tried to scream your name
But then you turned to look at me
And it blew my soul away
you're a million miles away
But still I hear you sayin'
We're gonna save the world
Together we can make it
I take this all upon yourself (I take this upon yourself)
And in all of you I trust
You rock and pull me over
We're gonna save the world
Aye aye aye
It's not you, it's me
It's the way it's gotta be
No hurt in love
Then I come right back to you
We're gonna save the world together we can make it
Take this all upon yourselves (take this on yourself)
And if all of you I trust rock and pull me over
We're gonna save the world
We're gonna change the world
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye
Aye aye aye yeah
