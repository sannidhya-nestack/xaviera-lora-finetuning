I feel the dark, it prowls my street
It whispers in and pulls my feet
So drive to find some comfort on the breeze
To go somewhere else
I'm out of air
I'm out too long
I'm out to find the reasons why my days run long
there's comfort behind windows in a storm
But I'd rather have the lightning keep me warm
It's no past time to leave
I'm hating this view
You hold it when I breathe
I doubt on this view
A late night drive just shows
It's only me and endless arrows in the road
I'll cut my hair
I'll cut my name
I'll cut out looking for somebody else to blame
the maps are old and rotten, ripped and torn
And I won't be taken by the past they've worn
It's no past time to leave
I'm hating this feel
You're over when I breathe
I doubt I'll miss you
A late night drive just shows
It's only me and then the sad rose in the road
I'll break for nothing
I'll break for nothing
