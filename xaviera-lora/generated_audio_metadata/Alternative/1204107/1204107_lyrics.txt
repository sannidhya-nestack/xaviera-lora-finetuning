Tell me, tell me what you want
I ain't gonna tell you babe
I ain't gonna tell you babe
Tell me, tell me what you got
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
Oh, tell me where you're going
If you love me, then show it
If you love me, then show it, show it, oh
Show me, show me what you want
I ain't gonna tell you babe
I ain't gonna tell you babe
Show me, show me what you got
Tell me how to get it baby
Tell me how to get it baby
Oh, tell me what you're thinking
Is there something I'm missing?
Or you're making it useless?
Oh
Tell me where you're going
If you love me then show it
If you love me then show it, show it, oh
