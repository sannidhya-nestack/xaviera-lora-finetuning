It's okay, I don't have to feel heavy as I'm seeming accidentally dreaming
It's okay, I don't have to worry about what's really hurting if you understand me
Baby I'm lonely, baby I'm lonely too
So when the voice in your heart gets too loud
Just call and I'll come running for miles
I'll crawl to you over broken glass if I have to
I'll drown with you where the water's fast if you want to
Whatever makes you feel alive
I would lie with you across that line
If you only want to make me crazy
Maybe I am just scared of hearing
All the precious feelings
That I know you're keeping and even
And when it is hard for giving, I'll be not to giving in in this condition
Over broken glass, I'll be standing next to you
Won't you understand, I got nothing left to lose
I'll crawl to you, I'll crawl with you
I will follow you beyond
I'll fall if you want only
you're the first one that knows
