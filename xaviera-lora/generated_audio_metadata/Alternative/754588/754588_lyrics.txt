I told her I was twenty five
And said I was never high
And she's around'em not myself
She only loves me'cause I lie
I be the best she's ever had
If all my lies were facts
I can't make her love me
But I know how to act
I'm a liar
I'm a sinner
But I got hope
I got her, she's all mine
But I'm a liar, I say it's alright
Like I got nothing to hide
When she's around I'm not myself
She only loves me'cause I lie
I quit smoking
When she's around, there's no hoping
She'll have her find out
That I'm a liar and I'm a sinner
But I got her, yeah, I got her
She's all mine
But I'm a liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar
I'm a liar
I'm a liar, I'm a liar, I'm a liar
Apple, apple, apple, apple
