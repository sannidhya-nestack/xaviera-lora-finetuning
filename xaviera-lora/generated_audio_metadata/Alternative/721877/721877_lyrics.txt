He is true, He is God, He is good
He is true, He is good, He is good
Smelling in a ring I'm gone
Shards of fire splinter through the glass
And all the citizens at the door
Clean my mouth
Most high
In the heart of a mountain
He is true, he is true, he is true
You, you, you
He is God, He is God, Lord is His name
