You made it worth living
A ghost, you said go get moving
Your joke, think of them living
And I can say I think of you
But I'm afraid of missing you
I felt like a sinking ship
But you showed me there's meaning in
I, I won't be afraid anymore
I, I don't overthink anymore
Shift, who you becoming?
I'll ask for a cigarette
Laugh at the years that you sold them
I fell
Like a sinking ship but you showed me there's meaning
I, I won't be afraid anymore
I, I don't overthink anymore
I, I won't be afraid anymore
I, I don't overthink anymore
I called in to see he's sick
Crying made me feel like shit
Turned around and then saw him
Does he know what's happening?
ot my age a year too late
Thank my God I saw your face
Calculate the visits left
Save your call so I won't et
I, I won't be afraid anymore
I, I don't overthink anymore
I, I won't be afraid anymore
