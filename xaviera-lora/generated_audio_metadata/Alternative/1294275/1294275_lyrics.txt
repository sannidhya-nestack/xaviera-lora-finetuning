This house was built on last light
Now we're just waiting for low tide
The past is written on both sides
Leave me to see you with fresh eyes
It's coming up in the new light
The truth was hidden in plain sight
I ain't from holding it up right
The expectation is too tight
Send it up straight
We're waiting for low tide
Don't let'em come your way
We're waiting for low tide
Too little was too late
We're waiting for low tide
I can't carry this dead weight
We're all waiting for low tide
These broken branches they're eating me
Please free me from the dead tree
There's not much left now before we
Look closer you can't see through me
Set it up straight
We're waiting for love time
Don't let go, don't wait
We're waiting for love time
Too little was too late
We're waiting for love time
I can't carry this dead weight
We're waiting for love time
Set it up straight, we're all waiting for low tide
Don't let go, don't wait, we're all waiting for low tide
Too little was too late, we're all waiting for low tide
I can't carry this dead weight, we're all waiting for low tide
