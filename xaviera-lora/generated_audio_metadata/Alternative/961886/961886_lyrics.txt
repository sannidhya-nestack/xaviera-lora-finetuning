But is that lady Jane?
Or if that is her name?
She wants to walk but he sucks the sock, yeah
She will run you down and anyone she sees
Old lady Jane, you don't care if I don't pay
We work all night,'cause I've been working all day
But I'm terrified when you feel alive
That something inside that I don't know
But I'll petrify it, and it worth lies
Somehow you can't let go, no
She holds me so close
Takes off all my clothes
Everyone knows how the story goes but
She will take your life and change it in the same way
Old lady Jane, you don't care if I don't pay
We work all night,'cause I've been working all day
When I'm terrified (when I'm terrified)
When you feel alive (when you feel alive)
There's something inside that I don't know (that I don't know)
But I'm petrified (I'm petrified)
In your workplace (in your workplace)
Somehow you can't let go, no
Old lady Jane, you don't care if I don't pay
We work all night,'cause I've been working all day
But I'm satisfied when you feel alive
That's something inside that I don't know
But I'll pay to fly (I'll pay to fly) if you were to fly (if you were to fly) so now you can't let go, oh no, oh no
