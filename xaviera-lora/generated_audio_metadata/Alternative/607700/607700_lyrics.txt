Because in the end the lights are dim and the music is fading out
The pitch is black
Think back
And I wish I smoked
According to addicts
Or maybe I made you cry
And your car crashed
Nothing but a big exaggerator
A critic, you love it when I freak over nothing
There's one I remember when we both started running
The cops called my mother, now I have another story
A plot to exaggerate and oh
Oh no, they're onto me now
Put all your jokes aside
And all your revelations behind you
Because it's about to capsize
And leave you, and leave you understood
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't think, and I don't try
I love you, I should've said it a hundred times
I love you, I love you, I love you, etc
I hate it that you're hurting, oh God
My calling card is running out of minutes
I wish I knew more about my dad, my mom, my brother and everyone
