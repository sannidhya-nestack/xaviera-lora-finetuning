She said she died believing excuses
She said her life turned to apathy
They built her up and they broke her to pieces
Nothing to blame but her loyalty
And it's been years now since her heart stopped beating
Her heart stopped beating, woah
Yeah, it's been years now since that clock stopped ticking
She said, "Make it move" (woah-oh-oh)
She said, "Make it move" (woah-oh-oh)
Show me what your love can do (woah-oh-oh)
Show me what your love can do (oh, oh)
She said make it move
I feel the same girl, believe me I'm hardened
No perfect soulmate could fix my faith
I trust'em just about as far as I can throw them
I let'em in and then I push them away
And it's been years now since my heart stopped beating
My heart stopped beating, woah
Yeah, it's been years now since the clock stopped ticking
She said make it move, woah
She said make it move, woah
Show me what your love can do, woah
Show me what your love can do
She said make it move (She said make it move) (She said)
And it's been years now since a heart stopped beating
The heart stopped beating more
Yeah it's been years now since that
Clock starts ticking
She said make it move
She said make it move
Show me what your love can do
Show me what your love can do
She said make it move
