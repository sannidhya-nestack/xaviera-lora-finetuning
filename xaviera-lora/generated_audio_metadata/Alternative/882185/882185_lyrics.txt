Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all about you
No, no, no, no, no, it's not about you
No, no, no, no, no, it's not about you
Then around you
It's pulling strings in your mind
Just whispering what to do
Yeah yeah yeah
Who you gonna turn to
See beyond the physical
And feel something spiritual
The answer lives in your mind, your mind
The answer is high from inside out
The answer lives in your mind, your mind
Behind those eyes you can't see, you can't see
You can't say the truth
Time isn't with you (with you)
Your mind's stuck in rewind
In this present moment you might find
You might find
The problems don't exist here
The past and the future disappear
And my body connection's clear
Answer this in your mind, your mind
Answer it, heart from inside out
Answer lives in your mind
Your mind
Behind those eyes
You can't say
You can't say
You can't say
But you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all around you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it' all around you
No no, no no no, it's not about you
No no, no no no, it's not about you
