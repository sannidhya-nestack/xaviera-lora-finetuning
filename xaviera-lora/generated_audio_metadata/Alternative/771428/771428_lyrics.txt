When I said I'll love you'til the end
May the end never come
When the day comes for me to die
Then I'll die and love you all the same
When I'm looking over from above
Don't you dare, don't you dare give up the fight
I'll always love you'til the end
And when we're alone
Afraid I can't fight it
You know I can't hide it
So come and ignite it
I will not end up without your memories
They're fading away
I will not give up forever and after
Why won't you stay?
When I said I'll love you'til the end
May the end never come
When the day comes for me to die
Then I'll die and love you all the same
When I'm looking over from above
Don't you dare, don't you dare give up the fight
I'll always love you'til the end
These operations running through my head
Even if I was here with you instead
Baby if I was here with you right now
I will not end up without your memories they're fading away
I will not give up forever and after why won't you stay
When I said I'll love you'til the end
May the end never come
When the day comes for me to die
Then I'll die and love you all the same
When I'm looking over from above
Don't you dare, don't you dare give up the fight
I'll always love you'til the end
When I'm looking over from above
Don't you dare, don't you dare give up the fight
I'll always love you'til the end
