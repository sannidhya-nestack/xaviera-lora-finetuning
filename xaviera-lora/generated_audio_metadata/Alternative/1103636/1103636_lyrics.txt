Spit out the toxic you needed to feel
We rule, we're losing simple ground
In rage we cultivate madness
We rule, we're losing inch by inch
In rage we cultivate madness
My rules, they were not broken, I left the scene
It was a madhouse, these thoughts and images
Won't wash away with all the whiskey that I'm drinking
Wake up, don't let your mind play tricks
You may recognize my voice, might remember these words
My thoughts you'll never know, I sent them to the underground
Below my secrets slip through, bringing pieces of sound
Bringing pieces of silence
We rule, we're losing simple ground
In rage we cultivate madness
We rule
We're losing inch by inch
In rage we cultivate madness
