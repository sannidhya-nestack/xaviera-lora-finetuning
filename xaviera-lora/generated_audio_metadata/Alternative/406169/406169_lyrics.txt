We'll smoke crack with the princess
Here at the end of the world
It's all a matter of hate and disgust
They're gonna kick who's left and get on with the beast
And fly saucers through the sun as we chase after the universe
But we're always behind
We're crawled up from the mud
We grew feet and got red
There were puddles of guts
Where a million others laid down and died
Cause the heat was too great
And the mosquitoes were too big
And they were so filled with blood
That they were popping and bursting all over the place
And so the ground was red
It's time to face yourself
And try to deal with the stench
Stained glass, flavored crystals
For people with their bodies broken to bits
There comes a time when there's nothing left to build
So you just shudder and smile
Millions of terrible moles
They came down from the sky
And they cover my body
I can't breathe to escape
They thud in my ears
Crawl over my chest
It's oddly funny
We live tiny lives
We beg for money and sex
A quick, sweet shiver and then you come back to yourself
You'll never be the same again'cause you slipped through your hands
And you can only hope for something that'll finally last
We'll plant trees with the killers
As the sirens wail
And the smoke drifts up
And the highway shivers
It's the junk monster spitting
It's the wet shattered cauldron
It's the dog with a conscience
It's the fish in the mud
It's the sound of God dying
It's a crisis of meaning
Millions of terrible moles
Millions of terrible moles
Millions of terrible moles
Millions of terrible moles
