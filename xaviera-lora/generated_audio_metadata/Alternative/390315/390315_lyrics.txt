Cast a stone into our still pool of water
Circles form then fade away
Like a memory that you've tried to recapture
Colours pale
Two subtle grains
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
This place I've known
Since I was a small child so much higher
These trees once reached
Now I dared to look
Down roads untraveled
And tomorrow's promised
Staring back at me
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
Cast a stone into our simple water
Circles fall then fade away
Like a memory that you've tried to recapture
Colours pale
Two subtle grains
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
And I fade away
