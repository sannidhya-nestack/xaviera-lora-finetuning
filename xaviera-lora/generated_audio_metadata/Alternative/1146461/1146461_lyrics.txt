I know you feel like you're different, you know it's okay to break away
Doesn't matter what people will say
Let'em talk, let'em talk anyway
You and I, we sing our own melody
You and I, we speak differently
You and I are changing
You and I, yeah, you and I
We've got special love, special love
We got special love, special love
Won't let nobody get us down, okay, okay
Got two feet on the ground, okay
We got special love, special love
Hate'til you think that you're happy, you know it's okay to break away
Even if the whole world says no way
Let'em talk, yeah, let'em talk any way
You and I, we sing our own melody
You and I, we speak differently
You and I are changing
You and I, yeah, you and I
We've got special love, special love
We got special love, special love
Won't let nobody get us down, okay, okay
Got two feet on the ground, okay
We got special love, special love
You and I, we sing our own melody
You and I, we speak differently
You and I are changing
You and I, yeah, you and I
We've got special love, special love
We've got special love
Special love
Won't let nobody get us down, okay, okay
Got two feet on the ground, okay
We got special love
Special love
