I know this is not your conscious doing
We don't seem to be in tune
I hear you playing your instrument
There's something I'm afraid to do, see
In my dreams we aren't like this
Every time I close my eyes
You are drawing me into you
And it's all a big surprise
That's all I want is just one shot
To see if it's really there, to see if it's not
I've pictured your kiss, the electric attraction
But nothing could prepare me to take in your reaction
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
I scan your face for recognition
That I'm not just making this up
You're crawling into my dreams
And then I question all when I wake up
Your kisses they seem familiar
Your touch I cannot hide
Making me feel something I've never ever felt inside
That's all I want is just one shot
To see if it's really there, to see if it's not
A picture to your kiss, the electric attraction
But nothing could prepare me
For taking your reaction
I would try to make you remember the way you made me feel
All those twilights in my head I could swear were all so real
You would never look away when your eyes meet my glance
Because you want to linger for a second chance
That's all I want is just one shot
To see if it's really there, to see if it's not
I've pictured your kiss, the electric attraction
I've pictured your kiss the electric attraction
I've pictured the way you're gonna hold me in your arms my love
Nothing could prepare me to take in your reaction
(Mumbling)
