If there's alkaline that keeps my stomach turnin'
shit battery power to keep my fun-off burnin'
I'd set fire to the child that's screamin' at me
Sing it, I'd set fire
I got a vision in my mind that sparked my central healing
When my head comes to stand tall, it's loud and screaming
When I open my wings and dance, they call my name
And compel every part of me
This is the spring back for the same
We cast our second to last goodbyes
With electrical fences around our spines
We're all just products of our minds
I don't wanna be a producer in disguise
But it kills me to believe
You killed the believer that lives in me
Where's to the concrete if not this?
This is just point blank modesty
I miss the table outside my window
Sticking out of something new down there
It's probably just a bad plan
I'm getting cold shakes all of the time
I'm gonna miss you when this cradle cracks in two
I'm gonna kill myself for you if you want me to
I don't wanna wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
News, violence, nightmares, leave me shaking
All onto my head
I don't wanna wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
News, violence, nightmares, leave me shaking
All onto my head
This is the closest I've been to far away you
This is the furthest that I've been to close
And this'll be the concept I fear the most
And it brings me to my knees
I'm a stone that can touch the field
And I constantly got these conversations with myself
I got a vision in my mind that's part of my central head end
When my inconsistent jokes are loud and screaming
When I hope you accidentally call my name
And compare every part of me
This is the spring back mother's sin
I don't want to wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
Nails violent darkness
Root me shaking
Hold on to my head
I don't want to wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
Nails violent darkness
Root me shaking
Hold on to my head
I don't wanna wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
Knees fallin' down as you move me shaking
All onto my head
I don't wanna wake up tomorrow
In the same place I let my head
Knees fallin' down as you move me shaking
All onto my head
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
