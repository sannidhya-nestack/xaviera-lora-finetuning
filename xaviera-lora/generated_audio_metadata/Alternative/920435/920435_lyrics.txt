There is a place for all of you inside my chest
One by one go back to our homes
We came alone, return alone
all things end
We've gone as far as we can
We know the power of pain
It's not the end
It's not the end
The bone and the sinew may fade
The heart and the body will ache
For something more
It's not the end
I can't go back
Time that I lack
It holds me here
While you are free
You wait for me
What if I can't last through the end
Without your face
Without your voice to hold me up
We've gone as far as we can
We know the power of pain
It's not the end
It's not the end
The bone and the sin you may fade
The heart and the body will lay
For something more
It's not the end
