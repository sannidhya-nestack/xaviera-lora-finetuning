Get up out of bed
Drag my head
Much as I'd like to stay in
Just can't get ahead in this life
Well this city is so bad
If only we could pay our bills
And all of our dreams instead
Then we would be so very wealthy
Bartenders says I've had enough
For the night, for the week, for the month
Just one more drink and I'll go
Just one more and you'll see me no more
One more day, long line of days
That all look the same
Don't dream too big
Or you'll just end up disappointed
We can't, we can't escape this game
This vicious cycle
Living to work and working to live
No rest, no rest for us, no time (this is just psycho)
No work and no play, make Jacket, oh boy
Oh doctor please prescribe me something to help me with my sleep
My anxiety is getting worse and worse and worse and worse
Paranoia is setting in setting in
We can't, we can't escape this camp (this vicious cycle)
Living to work and working to live
No rest, no rest for us, no time (this vicious cycle)
No work and no play, make Jacket a boy
