When machines eat, they eat me
When they run right, they run me
Shut me down now
Power down please
Pull the plug on me
Control, alt, delete
Ooh, I lost my appetite
The drool, the drain, the way they drone
I lost my memory, the meal, the meat, the way they moan
When machines eat, they eat me
When they save time
They steal it from me
Shut me down now
Turn me off
Pull the plug on me
Make it stop
Ooh, I lost my appetite
The drool, the drone, the way they drain
Ooh, I lost my memory
The e, the grind, the gulping pain
When machines eat
Drown the internet
Go to the screen
Blind the motherboard
Disabled and mean
When machines build
They build me
When they breathe in
They choke me
Shut me down now
Power down please
When machines eat
Control of the flea
