I find you in my head sometimes
Keep everything you said on rewind
You needed me to tell the truth
And I needed you to see right through me
I find it hard to keep my cool
But stop feeling like a stupid fool
I needed you to love
And you needed me to keep on coming round
We could've done better
We could've tried harder
We could've been stronger
We could've gone further
We could've shined brighter
We could've been so much more
We could've done better
We could've tried harder
We could've been stronger
We could've gone further
We could've shined brighter
We could've been so much more
But you walked right out the door
I find you in my bed at night
Keep everything you said on my timeline
There's something in the way I lose
Till nothing's really left of me or you
I find it hard to rearrange
To get back on my feet and start again
You never really leave my side
I find you everywhere I try to hide
We could've done better
We could've tried harder
We could've been stronger
We could've gone further
We could've shined brighter
We could've been so much more
We could've done better, we could've tried harder
We could've been stronger, we could've gone further
We could've shined brighter, we could've been so much more
I find you in my head sometimes
Keep everything you said on rewind
You needed me to tell the truth
And I needed you to see me through
We could've done better
We could've tried harder
We could've been stronger
We could've gone further
We could've shined brighter
We could've been so much more
We could've done better, we could've tried harder
We could've been stronger, we could've gone further
We could've shined brighter, we could've been so much more
But you walk right out the door
I find you in my head sometimes
Keep everything you said on rewind
You needed me to be a friend
I needed you to be there till the end
