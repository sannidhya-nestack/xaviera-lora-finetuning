I'm falling, don't know what to do
I'm crawling, on my knees to you
So sorry, for all the things I said
I'm fighting, the demons in my head
Every time we move in close
Something always goes so wrong
It's as if I lose control
Who knows where these thoughts come from
On a roller coaster ride
Waiting for the game to stop
Maybe one day you'll call time
Reach the end we're getting off
I'm falling
I don't know what to do
I'm crawling
On my knees to you
So sorry
For all the things I said
I'm fine
The demons in my head
A lottery, the state of mind
Putting on a different face
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde
Oh, come visiting today
It must be a private hell
To have the patience of a saint
And I don't deserve your help
You soldier on and keep the faith
I'm falling, falling down
Falling down
I'm falling, don't know what to do
I'm crawling, on my knees to you
So sorry, for all the things I said
I'm fighting, the demons in my head
I'm fine
