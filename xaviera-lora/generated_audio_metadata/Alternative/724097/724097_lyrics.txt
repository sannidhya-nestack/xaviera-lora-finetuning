The sunrise has never looked so good at night
I guess I'm stuck in the meantime
Can you listen and can I fish with you?
The gestures never stop me from waiting
For a chance to say something along the lines of
Can I fish with you?
I'd like to listen to stories of your past
Tales that tell me how you've grown up alone
How you're undersworn
And as I start to wonder how I've got a bite
I used to say I would forever never change
And I remember how my friends all went away
And now it's only sad as the exhale
And now you know the rest
I'm stuck fishing for whales
The sunrise never looks good in the night time
It told me that it draws a fine line of what it means to show itself to us
He told me that somewhere out there's a grey sky
One that I swear that I must find
Amidst the clouds it hides itself from me
I know that somewhere out there's a white lie
Amidst the surface of how
I comprehend it may be understood
And as I start to wonder how I've got a bite
I used to say I would forever never change
And I remember how my friends all went away
And now my story's only sad as he exhales
And now you know the rest I'm stuck fishing for ways
The sunset finds itself in the moonlight
Among the clouds that I can't find
Alone at night when we all watch him fly
Conversations never this boring
I promise I can find something
To talk about with you, I am the moon
Trying to talk to you about something
Tell me are you even trying
To me it feels like fishing for whales
I used to say I would forever never change
And I remember how my friends all went away
And now it's always only sad as the accent
And now you know the rest I'm
Duck fishing for whales
