Rough and raw on the inside of my throat
I've been screaming for hours now
But you don't seem to hear
I guess you never really cared
Is this what you wanted
For everything to fall apart
Is this what you wanted
One last shot in the dark, dark
Rough and raw and raw and rough
You called my name and I called your bluff
Rough and raw and raw and rough
I tried to stop but I can't give you up
Here we are in the middle of the night
You know I loved you
I never thought you'd be the one to lie and break me down
Is this what you wanted
For everything to fall apart?
Is this what you wanted?
One last shot in the dark
Rough and raw and raw and rough
You called my name I called your bluff
Rough and raw and raw and rough
I tried to stop but I can't give you up
Rough and raw on the inside of my throat
I've been screaming for hours now
But you don't seem to hear
I guess you never really cared
Rough and raw and raw and rough
You called my name I called your bluff
Rough and raw and raw and rough
I tried to stop but I can't give you up
Tried to stop but I can't give you up
