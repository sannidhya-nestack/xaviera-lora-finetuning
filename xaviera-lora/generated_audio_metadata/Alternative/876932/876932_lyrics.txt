I sing a timeless story, the song about a girl
A tale of tragic glory, to captivate the world
I don't want to award you any undue fame
So the star of this lyric doesn't have a name
I wanna laugh it off but this isn't a game
I wanna write a song and sing it in your name
But who cares?
I'll recover
I wanna rip my heart out, throw it on the ground
I wanna scream your name out just to hear the sound
But who needs another?
Song named after a girl
Song named after a girl
The plot line is a classic
Been done a million times
But never so sarcastic
With such ironic rhymes
So I hope I get bonus points for novelty
When you calculate all the time you wasted on me
I wanna laugh it off but this isn't a game
I wanna write a song and sing it in your name
But who cares
I'll recover
I wanna rip my heart out, throw it on the ground
I wanna scream your name out, just to hear this sound
But who needs another song named after a girl?
Song named after a girl
I wanna laugh it off, but this isn't a game
I wanna write a song and sing it in your name, but
Who cares?
I'll recover
I wanna rip my heart out, throw it on the ground
I wanna scream your name out, just to hear the sound, but
Who needs
A name?
Song named after a girl
Song named after a girl
Song named after a girl
Another
Song named after a girl
