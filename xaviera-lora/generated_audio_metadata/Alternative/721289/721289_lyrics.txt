Yeah, wasted, useless, on your own, not ready to go
Can't go down, you can't go back, and you can't need anymore
Go baby, cultivating a sense of ambition
Go get a life, you go go to life
Why do you take me back?
I can't take you out, I can't take you anywhere without a leash
So sloppy, drunk and stumbling like a pinball
Bound to downtown breaking everything in your head, girl
Go baby, cultivating a sense of ambition
Whiskey on ice
To cool out your life
Why do you take me for?
I can't take you out
I can't take you anywhere without a leash
Whiskey on ice
Put out your lights
Whiskey on my eyes
To put out your
Why do you take me for?
I can't take you out, I can't take you anywhere
What do you take me for?
I can't take you out, I can't take you anywhere without a leash
