Watching you drift away
Meeting you all the way
I will be
Waiting for you, for you
The turning of night to day
I will be waiting for you
Do they see me?
The places you go
Do they feel me?
Could you stand up only?
Stand up only
Do they know me?
The places you go, do they know me?
If you let go, easy, let go, easy
You're walking out in the light
Or stepping out in the light
I will be
Waiting for you (for you)
The turning of day to night
I will be
Waiting for you (do they see me?)
The place is you
Do they feel me? (Stand up, oh baby, stand up, oh baby)
There's a shooting pain, vacant heart
Do they see me? (The places you go)
Do they feel me? (If you let me go easy, let me go easy)
This time the world will start to cry
Do they see me?
Places you go
Do they feel me?
Stand up only
Sudden change
Stand up only
Golden ring
Do they see me?
The places you
Do they feel me? (If you let me go)
Unbroken vow (let me go)
Broken vow (let go)
