I've been thinking'bout you
Here in the dark town, here in the dark town
You don't even know but
You're lighting up my heart
Come on, come on
You gotta love me now
Oh, come on, come on
You gotta love me now
I'm hungry to your love
I'm losing my mind
I'm hungry to your love
I'm losing my mind
I'll win to your love
I've been thinking'bout you
Here in the dark town, here in the dark town
You don't even know but
You lighten up my heart
Come on, come on
You gotta love me now
Oh, come on, come on
You gotta love me now
I'm hungry to your love
I'm losing my mind
I'm hungry to your love
I'm losing my mind
I'm into you a lot
