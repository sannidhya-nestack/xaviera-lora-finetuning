Take your love and leave
It's clear I make mistakes
Our ship is headed for the shoals
I hear the mirror break
And I still wanna laugh
But our ship is headed for the shoals
Take your love and leave
And that's when I felt like we hit a sandbar
And I had to work every night till nine o'clock
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out perfectly
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out at all
And maybe things don't work out perfectly
And I still wanna laugh but I shit his head for the shows
So take your love and leave
That's when I felt like we hit a sandbar
And I had to work every night'til nine o'clock
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out perfectly
And maybe sometimes things aren't meant to work out at all
I still wanna love, our ship is headed for the shoals
So take your love and leave
I feel the salt on my skin
The tide pulling me away
All the words we never said
Weigh heavy day by day
It's hard to watch us drift apart
But I can't hold the line
I gave everything I had
Now I'm running out of time
I see you fading on the horizon
Lonely silhouette
Our ship is lost among the shoals
A memory I can't et
So take your love and leave
that's all there's left for me
Take your love and leave
And let these waters set us free
I still wanna love
I still want love but shit is headed for the shows
So take your love and leave
