Have you ever thought
To ask for answers in an order?
Come out, come out, it's hard to be a young girl
Out there so, here's to you as you find out
As you walk, walk through the door
As you walk
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I love you, I love you
The thought to ask for answers
In and on the ocean
Come out, come out, it's hard to be on your own
When you're out there, so
Here's to you as you find out
As you walk
Walk through the door
As you walk
Walk through the door as you walk
