Oh, how do we hold this stuff of stars?
Hold it together when you pull it apart
When did we become strangers to our own kind?
I try not to waste what's precious and pure
But some hearts find a cure
One love is enough to turn these sky-tipped brains to you
Oh how do I touch the tips of stars?
And how do we hold each other's heart?
Maybe we're strangers in another life
I wish we never had more time
But you know that I'll still come around'cause
One love is enough to turn these skies of grey to blue
Maybe I've been caught up in this state of mind
But you know I ain't leaving
