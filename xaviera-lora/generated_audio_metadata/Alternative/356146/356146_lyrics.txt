Try to be good, keep my distance from trouble
Never do what you should with you, my trouble is double
Your little black heart set on having some fun
I can't hold out much longer
Pulling me in with your physical traits
You've got'em and you flaunt'em and you use'em as bait
My heart's pounding now like you're holding a gun
I should be so much stronger
But I'm craving your corruption
Spend delicious time up ahead
Watch me do what I do best
I'm craving your corruption
You should stay platonic instead
Lay back baby I'll do the rest
You know I'm craving your corruption
Spend delicious time up ahead
Watch me do what I do
I'll do the rest
I'm craving your corruption
We should stay platonic instead
Just stay back baby, I'll do the rest
Grinding those gears, locomotive machine
Come a toast, let's go, wake in a dream
I know what you want and you know what I mean
Let's go, time to bring the heat
Craving your corruption
Scandalous system up ahead
What's to do when I
I do best, I'm craving your corruption
We should stay platonic instead
Stay back baby, I'll do the rest
You know I'm craving your corruption
Spend delicious time at the head
You watch me do what I do best
I'm craving your corruption
We should stay platonic instead
Just stay back baby, I'll do the rest
Corrupt me
Corrupt me
Corrupt me
Craving your corruption
Scandalicious time up ahead
What's the do when I do best?
I'm craving your corruption
You should stay platonic instead
Lean back baby I'll do the rest
You know I'm craving your corruption
Scandalicious time up ahead
What's the do when I do best?
I'll do the best, I'm craving your corruption
You should stay platonic instead
So stay back baby, I'll do the rest
