Déjà vu and I'm with you, moments we share
Lights chasing shadows, it's like breathing air
Laughing through the daylight, time seems to pause
Every little heartbeat, feels like a cause
I don't get any closer
Am with you now, then I am with you now
No I don't get any closer than I am with you now
Whispers in the evening, underneath the stars
Painting our memories, just us and guitars
Echoes of our laughter, like a sweetest song
Feeling so alive and
Like we both belong
I don't get any closer with you now
No, I could am with you now
Than I am with you now
Life's a kaleidoscope, you're my brightest hue
In this tangled world, I just want you
I don't get any closer than I am with you now
No, I don't get any closer than I am with you now
