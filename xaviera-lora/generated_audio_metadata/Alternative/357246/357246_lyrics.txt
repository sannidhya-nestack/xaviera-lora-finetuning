Why am I here and shaking like this?
You never listen
I try to be clear
But everything I speak here you'll never understand
Never what you wish for but always what you plan
And all those things you work for are turning into sand
And it's shifting from your hand
So now why did it come so easy
So now why did it fall so hard
How could you know your life's a vapor
Then you're gone again, gone again
Why do you run and work so hard?
Are you disappointed in what you've become?
Shouting from the raindrops, screaming from the night
House across your building is stretching to the sky
You think you own the mountain because you climbed so high
But all of this is just wasting time
So now why did it come so easy?
So now why did it fall so hard?
How could you know?
Your life's a vapor
Then you're gone again, gone again
So now what, so now what
So now what
So now why did it come so easy?
So now why did it fall so far?
How could you know?
Your life's a vapor, then you're gone
So now why?
It's faith in shadow
So now what is love for sale?
How could you know your life's a vapor?
And you're gone again, gone again
And this house of cards, your building here is gone
