If you wanna jump
If you wanna fly
If you wanna go off, go off, go off
And be yourself, that's fine
If you wanna live
If you wanna feel alive
Then you gotta go off, go off, go off
And get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
If you wanna shout
If you wanna dance
Then you gotta come on, come on, come on, do it
now's your chance if you wanna live
If you wanna feel alive
Then you gotta go up, go up, go up
And get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
If you wanna jump, if you wanna fly
If you wanna go off, go off, go off
And get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit wild
Get a little bit crazy
Get a little bit wild
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
