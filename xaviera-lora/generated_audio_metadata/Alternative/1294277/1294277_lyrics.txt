It was there, we were there, in the air, in the air
It was there, it was there, in the air, in the air, so there
Can't live without it, real life without it
Can't dream without it, won't et about it
Can't live without it, real life without it
Can't do just without it
Won't et about it
So we live again
So we live again
So we live again
So we'll laugh and we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk about being naked together
And we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk about being naked together
And we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk about being naked together
And we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk about being naked together
And we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk about being naked together
And we'll talk about the weather
And we'll talk, we'll talk, we'll talk, we'll talk, we'll talk
