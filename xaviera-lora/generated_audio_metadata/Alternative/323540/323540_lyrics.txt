I'm just sitting here thinking'bout my baby
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout my girl
But it feels sweet, but it tastes like sugar candy
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout that girl
Ooh, late at night when she holds me tight
It's enough to drop on me and say
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout my baby
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout love
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout my baby
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout her love
She gives me money if I ever need it
She gives me love in every single night
Ooh, if you hold me tight and my eyes pop out of sight
It's enough you drop on me and say
I'm just sitting here thinking'bout my baby
Life's just an empty ball of love
