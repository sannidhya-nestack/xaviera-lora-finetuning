All hail the power
The broken crown
Streets paved with flowers
Statues coming down
We couldn't see
We couldn't see, we couldn't see, we couldn't see
All hail the melody
Bricks and mortar
Streets drowning ecstasy
Quarter by quarter
We couldn't see
We couldn't see
We couldn't see
We couldn't see
All hail the desert
Rivers run dry
Streets littered with money
Blowing the sky high
