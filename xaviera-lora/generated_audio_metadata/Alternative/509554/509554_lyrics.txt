Lost, lost in this fear
Can't escape from the calling
I'm drowning in tears
I sit and wait for the lightning
Soon the clock will start to chime
And we're running out of time
Now the countdown has begun
And the feeling carries on
When the hands keep moving fast
Every second is our last
Now there's nowhere left to hide
It's eleven fifty nine
Eleven fifty nine
Soon the clocks will start to chime
And we're running out of time
Now the countdown has begun
And the feeling carries on
When the hands keep moving fast
Every second is our last
Now there's nowhere left to hide
Fade
Sealed with a kiss
The kiss of life
I'm still waiting
Stay
Stay with me now
Until the end
Keep on praying
Soon the clock will start to chime
And we're running out of time
Now the countdown has begun
And the feeling carries on
When the hands keep moving fast
Every second is our last
Now there's nowhere left to hide
It's eleven fifty nine
Oh, eleven fifteen nine
Yeah, eleven fifteen nine
Oh, eleven fifteen nine
Yeah
Soon the clock will start to chime
And we're running out of time
Now the countdown has begun
And the feeling carries on
When the hands keep moving fast
Every second is our last
Now there's nowhere left to hide
It's eleven fifty nine
Tonight, tonight, tonight
