Mesmerized by the horizon
Twinkly stars sparkly diamonds
Watching the sun as it's rising
Feeling so calm hypnotizing
Lights are blue
And pink and orange
Sky so true
It seems so honest, drifting through
The clouds of promise, believing the sky has no ceiling
I love this feeling
The moment's right, the feeling's new
Magic, call me new
Crimson light, this violet hue
It's true
Tonight you reach into what's new
Tonight you reach into
You, you, you
Mesmerized by the horizon
Twinkly stars, sparkly diamonds
Glistening lights mystifying
Gazing afar is inspiring
Inviting you
To think upon it, gliding through
Your dreams of longing, pleasing you
Division of it, believing the sky has no ceiling
I love this beat
(Magical me, magical me, magical me, magical me, magical me)
You, you
I love this feeling, the moment's right, the feeling's new
Magical meaning, crimson light, this violet hue
It's true, tonight you reach into what's new
Tonight you reach into
You, you, you, you
You, you, you
As my horizon, my horizon
Twinkly stars, fuck a dinosaur
