Huh, what's in a flame?
Does it burn when it's buried? Is it harder than fame?
Does it sting when you slip from it and hide it away?
Does it hurt to know that what you heard was merely an echo?
Do you even know that I've become a he and you've become a headstone?
We can go beyond the one
Back when the man was an elephant throwing us orange from the storms
You posed a thorn in a bed I was born of
And now I lay me down to sleep tonight
Knowing that all your larvae eat away your DNA
And I pray that you die again
What's in a name?
Does it show the soul of your seed in my sway?
Back when you were two and I was three
Does it look the same? Okay maybe not
Cause I met you even for a little while, a lot
And inside of me there's some of you
That hasn't let me go, not
And I try not to cry
But what if those seeds pollinate
And see the light of day
Then our love will die again
Dead names, dead names
Tired of playing your head games
Man, it's a big shame
I can't remember your name
Not dead names, dead names
I can't remember your name
Bad names, bad names
Tired of playing your head games
That's a big shame
I can't remember your name
Bad names, bad names
I can't remember your name
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
