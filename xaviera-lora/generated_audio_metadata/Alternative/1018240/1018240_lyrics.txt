Can you feel the weight of my heart
Can you feel the weight
It gets heavier everyday
Cause the pain won't stop
Can you carry the weight
My blood bursts through its veins
And then I found out you're in love
Are you going to keep her
Can you feel the weight of my heart
Can you feel the weight
It gets heavier everyday
Cause the pain won't stop
Can you carry the weight
I'm not as strong as I used to be
Did I ruin myself
I got this heavy feeling
I can't seem to escape from
It's not healthy, no
It's not healthy, no
Sorry tonight I'm a dream again
This time you couldn't see me
Or maybe you just didn't want it to
But how could you et
How much you needed me
How much I cared
It was never fair
But it never is
I'm not strong enough
Can't get this sadness to leave
Nobody knows
And nobody knows
What's going on in my head
And if I can't get it out
I can't get you out
Get out of me
Get out of me
Can you feel the weight of my heart
Can you feel the weight
It gets heavier everyday
Cause the pain won't stop
Can you carry the weight
Oh free me from my body
I can feel it giving
Can you feel the weight of my heart? Can you feel the weight?
It got heavier everyday now the pain has stopped
I couldn't carry the weight
