You're the moth caught in my will
Bound by my strings, my sweet marionette
Ill romance with blood on my hands
Is the only kind I can get
You're the moth caught in my web
Trapped in the spotlight of my twisted head
Though this scene ends in tragedy
I'll relish your fleeting breaths
Oh, this is who I am, this is what I do
I can't help myself and I can't help you
You're the moth caught in my web
You're tired little wings, I will lay them to rest
Now let me do as I please
I'll be onto the
Next
Onto the
Next
Who are? Who are? Who are? Who are? Who are?
