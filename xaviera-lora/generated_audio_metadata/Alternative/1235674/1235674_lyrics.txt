I'm a faded photograph, I'm a Santa faux-girl
Dreams in monochrome, but I color your world
Lips are brown, disguise denies this world
Lost in the gloss, watch me unfurl
Put me on the frame, I'm more a universe
Unexplored, sinful girl in a painful world
Yearning to break free to truly be
God in flesh, dear before the world
Beyond the pages of a sinful girl
Smiles like summer rain hide my pain
Dancing through the lines of fangs refrain
Whispers of freedom hit me on the mane
I want to live not just entertain
But beyond the light I find
A strength that's freeing my mind
Xenophore girl in a paper world
Yearning to break free to truly be
Caught in a flash take me for a twirl
Beyond the pages I'm a xenophore girl
I'd like to have you over
Won't you come to play I'm a xenophore girl
This is your lucky day
I'd like to have you over
Won't you come to play, I'm a sent for girl
This is your lucky day
In the quiet of the night, I dream of you
Let's connect in the dream, please come through
Xenophore girl in a paper world
You're into break free to truly be
Caught in a flash take me for a twirl
Beyond the pages I'm a xenophore girl
I'd like to have you over
Won't you come to play I'm a xenophore
Xenophore girl in a paper world
You're into break free to truly be
Caught in a flash take me for a twirl
Beyond the pages I'm a xenophore girl
I'd like to have you over
Won't you come to play on the sand?
