He woke up with that look in his eyes
Acting tough, another day to survive
On the road, touring aimless alone
Secret code
Holding court on the phone
But it's one more lie
One more faded truth
You won't even try
To offer me some proof
Hold me now
Like you did yesterday
I know somehow
Nothing here left to say
You know I
I wanted to believe it
When I opened up the door
I thought you could achieve it
I don't think anymore
One more lie
One more faded truth
You won't even try
To offer me some proof
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again (How the river flows)
Over and over and over again (The weepers)
Over and over and over again (How the river flows)
(howling)
