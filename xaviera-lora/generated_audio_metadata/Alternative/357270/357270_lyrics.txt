I feel your gaze over my shoulder
And then I'm at your disappointment
You say there's nothing that I can do
But you can't prevent me from trying
I can't stop thinking about this
Such a sad sad situation
Just as we started to date off
We've fallen into accusations, I told you what I've done
Some part of you knows I'm not the devil's son
All I ask is that you consider this
In my voice to leave that feeling I miss
I can't believe what I've stood into
And all I have to do to convince you
You and me we're talking forever
And I walk out in the cold
Getting closer and closer together
Finishing each other's thoughts
I can't stop thinking about this
As you ignore every explanation
So many times I try to tell you
Over three hours of conversation I told you what I've done
Some part of you knows I'm not the devil's son
All I ask is that you consider this
In my voice you'll hear that feeling I miss
I can't believe what it's turned into
The more I have to do to convince you, no
I told you all that I have done
So one of you knows I'm not the devil's son
All I ask is that you consider this
Am I forced to live that feeling I miss?
I can't believe what I stood and do
I'm telling you whatever you thought isn't true
girls like you are too much to lose
And more will I have to do
Convince you
