If you'd take off all the clothes of these television shows
You might see the answer to the question left alone
It's cider in a flask, it's a spider in a glass
You see the question's not unknown, you've just been too afraid to ask
You're too afraid to ask
When it's all down to radiation
Microwaves and x-ray stations
Gyro slaves, deportation
Pyro flames and relocation
When you don't know who's wrong or right
Your seat's a flotation device
The tags on airplanes they don't lie
Furniture can save your life
If you undress the heart and pick it all apart
You might see some clarity and who you really are
Some glider flying past, some rider riding fast
On the road to great prosperity, shreddin' up the past
Mmm, shreddin' up the past
When it's all down to radiation
Microwaves and x-ray stations
Gyro slaves, deportation
Pyro flames and relocation
When you don't know who's wrong or right
You'll see it's a flotation device
The tags on airplanes, they don't lie
Furniture can save your life
Furniture can save your life, mmm
It's all down to radiation, gamma rays, communication, a handy cash
From a quick pick fix, a candy stash of pixie sticks
When the plane you're on takes off in flight
Tilt your seat to the upright
Sit back now and enjoy the ride
Furniture can save your life
Furniture can save your life
Furniture can save your life
