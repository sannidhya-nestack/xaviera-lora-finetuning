Die with the hell
Girl, I think you'd curse
Your evil little self
I tried to put you in the past
I'm feeling just a bit unwell
Let's make it go faster
Who can outlast her?
Who can live forever, never die?
Get prepared to skin a shedding
Heavy padding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark, black, dark black wedding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Lisa, check your dress, are you going to confess?
Do you think you're really ready for a dark black wedding?
Lisa, check my boots, my dark and evil boots
My appetite is ready for a dark black wedding, skin, skinning
Heavy pain
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark black, dark black wedding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Spirits lost as wed, they're living in the dead
Like the map of stars, weave the chains around our hearts
This might be doing right, it's the never ending fright
Disregard the warning and let's party'til the morning
Kids getting heavy, petty
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark black, dark black wedding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Skid shedding, heavy padding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark black, dark black wedding
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Blood is on the lace of the wedding dress you wear
A cold and ghostly face beneath your black raven hair
Silent yet so loud, the vows we now recite
To friends and highest spree as we revel in the night
Skin, steady, heavy, heading
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Tying, tying, dark black wedding
Dark black wedding
Embrace the night
Let darkness reign
Our love ignites
As sweet as cane
With every kiss
A silent scream
And in the dark
We live the dream
Do you hear the silent scream?
That's a dark black
Love is never what it seems
It's a dark black
Are we living in a dream?
It's a dark black, dark black wedding
A dark black wedding
I tonight love darkness reign
Our love ignites a sweet disdain
In every kiss a silent scream
And in the dark we live the dream
Do you hear the silent scream? That's a dark black
Love is never what it seems, it's a dark black
Are we living in a dream? It's a dark black, dark black wedding
A dark black wedding
Heavy, steady, heavy, heavy
It's an amazing night for a dark black wedding
Dark, dark, dark black wedding
Dark black wedding
Embrace the night, let darkness reign
A loving night, a sleepless day
With every kiss, a silent scream
And in the dark
We live the dream
Do you hear the silence scream?
That's a dark black
Love is never what it seems
It's a dark black
I'm living in a dream
It's a dark black, dark black wedding
A dark black wedding
Do you hear the silence scream?
It's a dark black, dark black wedding, a dark black wedding
