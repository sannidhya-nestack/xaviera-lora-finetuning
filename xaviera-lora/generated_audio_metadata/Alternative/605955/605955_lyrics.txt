I have always been a friend of danger
A life of playing safe could never do
And I'm much too quick to get on with a stranger
And there's not too many stranger than you
Now there hardly is a place a fool won't go
I know the story told is true
But I could never stand to miss you so
And it's dangerous to be in love with you
I guess I could live my life without you
It's easier to say you'll have to go
I could swear I just don't care about you
Just pretend the feeling isn't so
I know that our love can never be
I'm not so blind if I can't see
Love with danger's bound to make me blue
And it's dangerous to be in love with you
It's dangerous to be in love with you
It's dangerous to be in love with you
