Can we put this thing to rest
Place the past in its grave
You cannot live this way forever
Yesterday cannot be saved
You stood by the corner waiting
Trapped in a funeral song
I was on my knees begging for iveness
No longer will I crawl
Lord help me and discover me
A tall man, oh yeah
And this could be my crime, oh oh
Engraved and encrypted, do do do do
From the depths of time
Oh yeah, yeah, woah
There is no use hanging on
Flay have missed, what was is gone
Now the two must stop breathless
Running in confusion we were restless
Driven by an illusion that has since left us
But for tomorrow now I stand
Across the burning bridge to another land
There's so much I don't understand
There's so much I don't understand
And this could be a domain
And this could be my crime
Engraved and encrypted
For the gifts of time
And this could be my crime, oh oh
Engraved and encrypted
T-t-t-t-t-t-t
Vomit the depths of time
Yeah, yeah
Of you, of you, of you
