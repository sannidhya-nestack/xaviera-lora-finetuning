Give this a home, this feeling you gave me
It's new to my bones but it still doesn't phase me
Look in these eyes they will never lie to you
We've walked for miles in the middle of summer
I hate that I can't stay
Where have you been and why have you found me?
Why not yesterday?
Nabgi
Giving all I have to give you
But I could always find some more
whenever I am with you
I am ready to go
To a, to a, ready to go
To a, to a, ready to go
Follow me home, it's yours if you want it
Share what I have, it means nothing to me
My demons are gone, I'm saving you from them
They'll only punish me
I'm giving all I have to give you
But I could always find some more
Cause whenever I am with you
I am ready to go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war, to war
We'll go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war
Ready to go to war, to war, to war
