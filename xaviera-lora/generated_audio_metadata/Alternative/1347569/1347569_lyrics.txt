I don't whisper in riddles, I don't fake my desire
Every word's a confession, you're the spark, I'm the fire
No sugar, no halo, no polite restriction
I tell it straight up, baby that's non-fiction
Oh you talk like a poet
But your grin says sin
You swear it's the truth
I might let you begin
With your ink and your smoke
Are you ready for friction?
Let's see if you can handle my brand of non-fiction
No edits, no filters
No slight contradiction
You play it uncut
Beyond any prediction
Non-fiction
It's hotter than fiction
Your hands write the headline
My lips the addition
No fairytale crown
No stage benediction
Let's get out on the town
Live in large non-fiction
I'm not prince or a preacher
No knight with a sword
But I'll buy you the dream
And we'll skip the awards
I sparkle, I stoke it
Baby, I'm on a mission
You roll your eyes slightly
But you love my non-fiction
You got scars, I've got reason
We're not chasing a season
I don't need perfection
Just an honest connection
No smoke and no mirrors
No saints on commission
I'll take your sweet chaos and we'll call it ambition
No edits, no filters, no slight contradiction
We played uncut, living loud and non-fiction
Non-fiction, the sweetest affliction
We cross out the fables and dance the inscription
No bedtime illusion, no staged intermission
Hold the curtain aside
And witness non-fiction
The pages are burning
The ink cuts deep
Truth cuts like thunder
Unruly and wild
No curtain, no silence
No scripted evasion
Just fire in the bloodstream
Objectification
Non-fiction
A wild new rendition
We scribble the margins
And break with tradition
The veil turns to glass
The dream to incision
We vanish, we rise
Eyes in wicked precision
Ashes to laughter, stone into sound
The truth tastes sweeter when trouble's around
No illusions, no fiction, just playful affliction
Two voices collide and we live the non-fiction
Live the non-fiction
Live the non-fiction
