All I really want to do is drink myself to sleep and wake up with a headache
I don't have to say what's on my mind, it's written on my face, you liar
I can take a beating but I cannot take the screaming of my heart breaking
All I really want to do
Is drink myself to sleep
And wake up with a headache
It's the only thing that's true
pain is universal
Hoping that it hits you soon
Empty words fill empty bottles I keep listening but there's no message
Empty words fill empty bottles I keep listening but there's no message
Empty words fill empty bottles I keep listening but there's no message
Oh, I really wanna do
Is drink myself to sleep
And wake up with a headache
Hurts the only thing that's true
Cause pain is universal
Hoping that it hits you soon
All I really wanna do
Is drink myself to sleep
And wake up with a headache
Hurts the only thing that's true
Cause pain is universal, hoping that it hits you soon
