Like a time bomb set to break my heart
I heard you ticking from the start
Wiring into my nervous system
Save your prayers cause I'm not listening
It's like a rainbow sent to cleanse my soul
It came crashing down like a waterfall
You were the angel led to him by call
Was it ways too loud to hear my own voice at all?
May my heart be bound to something that I've found
Met a hurricane and left my soul to drown
And I've been waiting inside my head tonight
Like an exhibition that just isn't suicide
She had me gagged and bound and left my soul to die
Tie yourself to the traps tonight
I hope you start a mind inside me sets my soul alive
I guess I should've seen the world in time
But it's like bombs in heartbreak songs
A load of my life in the setting sun
There's a poltergeist in the father's kitchen
A devil outside the young boy's christening
May my heart be bound to something that I've found
Met a hurricane when she left my soul to drown
But I'll be waiting inside my bed tonight
Like an exhibition, exorcism, suicide
She had me getting bound and left my soul to die
Tie yourself to the tracks tonight
I only start a mind inside me sets my soul alive
I guess I should've seen the warning sign
But I've been waiting inside my head tonight
Like an exhibition of justice and suicide
Should I be condemned, bound, and lift my soul in doubt?
Tie yourself to the tracks tonight
I only start a line and suddenly set my soul alight
Should I be condemned, bound, and lift my soul in doubt?
But I've been waiting inside my
Lookin' as if we should exist isn't suicide
She and me gagged and bound and we're blessed so
Would you tie yourself to the tracks tonight?
My only sign of mind is time resets my soul alive
Guess I shoulda seen the world in science
I guess I shoulda seen the world in science
I guess I shoulda seen the world in science
I guess I shoulda seen the world in science
