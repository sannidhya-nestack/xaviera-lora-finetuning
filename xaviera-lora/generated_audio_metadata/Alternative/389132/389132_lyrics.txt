Feeling washed up, beat myself up, no more make up, things are fucked up, I've got nothing to say, now that I'm not writing songs about her anymore
Feeling run down, beat myself down, no more let down, things fine, roll down, don't know why I say what I say and let it get me up, sit down, take a look
I rebound and rebound but you break the code
There is no love anymore when there's no response no matter what I say
Wish it would go away
Wish it would go away
I've been told I'm scared to be alone yet
I'm scared everyone dies
I've been told I've changed and I lied
Yeah I've changed and everyone lied
Sometimes
Feeling run down, be mind, self doubt, no more, let down, things fall down
Don't know why I say what I say unless it get me up, set down, take over
I rebound and rebound but you make it sound
There is no love anymore when there's no response no matter what I say
Wish you would go away, wish you would go away
I rebound and rebound but you place it so hard
There is no love anymore when there's no response no matter what I say
Wish you would go away
Wish you would go away
Wish you would go away
