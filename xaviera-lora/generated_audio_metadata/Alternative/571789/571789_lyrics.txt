In the witching hour
She put a spell on me
Temperature like fire
Skin burning with the heat
I'm in a daze
It feels so strange
In the witching hour
She'll visit me again
With her mystic powers
The pleasure and the pain
Satanic charm
Will do you harm
I try to run away from you
But I can't fight the things you say and do
I'm locked inside the sweetest hell
Under your spell
Whoa, under your spell
It's the witching hour and I can't get no peace
There's a raging hunger deep inside of me
A wicked game is what you play
I try to run away from you (away from you)
But I can't fight the things you say and do (and do)
I'm locked inside the sweetest hell
Nowhere to hide
The cards you've dealt
Under your spell
Under your spell
