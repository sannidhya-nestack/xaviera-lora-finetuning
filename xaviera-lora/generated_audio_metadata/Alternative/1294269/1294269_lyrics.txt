Look away, don't be so shallow
By the way, your bones are hollow
If not today, then tomorrow
Either way, their eyes will follow
It's in your mind, not what I'm thinking
I think you'll find, your pipes are leaking
In time, you might just weaken
Never mind, this boat is sinking
Kiss the girls and run away
There's a game to wanna play
Pants on fire, lie a lie
Cross your heart in hopes of dying
It's what you said
Your bones were hollow
It's in your head
Your bones were hollow
Sticks and stones
Your bones were hollow
Are breaking bones
Your bones were hollow
Arms out, head back
Arms out, head back
Arms out, head back
Arms out, head back
Kiss the girls who made you cry
Cross your heart and hope to die
Kiss the boys and wave goodbye
Where's the needle in your eye?
Kiss the girls and watch them cry
Lamps on fire light your light
You're the one that chose to cry
Take the needle from my eye
