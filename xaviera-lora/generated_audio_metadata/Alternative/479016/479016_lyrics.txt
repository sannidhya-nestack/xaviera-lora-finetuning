If your name is John then you got to lay it on, pray it on
If your name is John then you got to play it on, pray it on
Watching you, watching me
We're in the space and time
Cause it doesn't need like you need me
No, and this is where I want to be
If your name is John
Then you got to come undone
Be the one
If your name is gone
Then you got to say it's on
Pray it's on
And everybody that you meet is nice to me tonight
And overly tame and not complete
No, then this is what I want to be
If your name is John
Then you got to lay it on
Pray it on
If your name is John
Then you got to play it on
Bray it on
Good name is John
Then you got to get it on
Bang a gong
Good name is John
Then you got to bray upon
Play a song
