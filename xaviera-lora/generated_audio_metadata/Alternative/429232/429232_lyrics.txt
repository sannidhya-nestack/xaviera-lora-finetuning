It's a state of mind that you can't hide
Hold it in your pocket, a gift to lead the blind
Go where you know, feel the warm wind blow in your life
Take me to a place where you stand tall
A land of milk and honey
Release the chain of all
Go where you know
Feel the whirlwind blow
Take me to the summertime
Bathing in red wine
You can say it's coming soon
I'm running through
Feel the calm in you
Make it easy, play the fool
Take the world and make it groove
Be there too
How can you go that way
Make it to the stars one day
It's all been up to you
Be there too
Picture this, a bitter memory (picture this, a bitter memory)
Time can make it happen, ashamed of what we see
Hey, don't let go, watch the spirit flow
Take me to the summertime, bathing in red wine
You can say it's coming soon
I'm running through
Feel the calm in you, make it easy play the fool
Take the world and make it grew, be there too
How can you go that way, make it to the stars one day
It's all been up to you
Be there to feel the calm in you
Make it easy, play the fool
Take the world and make it grow
Be there to how can you go that way
Make it to the stars one day
It's all been up to you
Be there to
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
