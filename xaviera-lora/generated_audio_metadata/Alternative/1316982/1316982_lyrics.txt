Under soft streetlights
We walk through the dark of my heart
Whispers of memories
Tlingle like a fading echo
Carried away and breathless in our thoughts
As the night clots our hopes in a fragile embrace
Searching for answers to hide in the shadows
We lost track time as the moments just all settled and chase
I'm caught up in a fantasy
It's a fire, gonna fall, gonna fall, I won't fall at peace tonight
And the dawn broke soft like acid colors on the ground
I felt the weight of silence and bitter space
The memories crashing like waves they pulled me under
The darkness found a glimmer of light
Those are ties that bind us
Two trips take our parts, I'll cherish each moment
Like a lost princess
In the quiet moments
When the world feels so right
I'll hold on to hope
Let it guide me through the night
With every heartbeat
I'll write my own song
Embracing the echoes
Where we both belong
So don't chase my dreams
I'll carve my path under these hanged skies
Follow it with a soft wind sigh
if I'm gonna fall I want to fall in peace tonight
