Oh when you're young
Sometimes living isn't that much fun
You fall straight to the ground
And fall with such a sound
You're getting knocked down
You scream so loud it's heard throughout the town
But there's hope here
You'll always have friends near
Oh when you're stuck in a hole
And there's no place left to go
And you're feeling so let down
And you can't help but wear a frown
Oh when you're stuck in a hole
And there's no place left to go
Oh you can always look up
So look up
And if you get old
I heard it said you lose your heart of gold
Well
I'll never let that go, that's how it goes
I'll sing a song nobody knows, but what's the point?
Of living with no soul
When you're stuck in a hole
And there's no place left to go
When you're feeling so let down
And you can't help but wear a frown
When you're stuck in a hole
And there's no place left to go
Oh, you can always look up
And I came, trying now to get a hold of things
And I came, running out of ways to say
But things are heavy and I've got no chance
To get out of this alive
When you're stuck in a hole and there's no place left to go
When you're feeling so let down and you can't help but wear a frown
When you're stuck in a hole and there's no place left to go
Oh, you can always look up
Oh, you can always look up
Oh, you can always look up
