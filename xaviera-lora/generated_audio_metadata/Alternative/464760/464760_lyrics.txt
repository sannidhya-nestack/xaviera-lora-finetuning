You reach into the night, obsidian and blight
A blight that leaves you always turning
You can't resist the shame, the deep vermillion game
Of love and luxury and burning
Deep in your desperate core
You can't stop wanting more
Revolving mirrors and tears and turning, burning
That faithful love of damaged years
The pain is mixed with blood
Your heart is burning full
Do you comply or give resistance?
You reignite the spark
Hoping to feel the burn
You're drawn toward the dark persistence
Deep in your desperate core
You can't stop wanting more
Revolving mirrors and tears and turning, burning
That faithful love of damaged yearning
That faithful love of damaged yearning
(You're crying, you're in pain for no reason)
(You're crying, you're in pain for nothing)
(Relax, my darling)
And I need more to say, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Deep in your desperate core
You can't stop wanting more
Revolving mirrors and tears and turning, burning
That faithful love of desperate yearning
That faithful love of damaged yearning
Of damaged yearning
