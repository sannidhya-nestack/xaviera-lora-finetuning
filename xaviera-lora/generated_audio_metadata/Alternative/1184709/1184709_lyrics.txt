It's too early in the morning
To be so hot we don't want to move
AC having a breakdown
Here's what we're gonna do
We're gonna throw that van in the window
Crank the dial get the breeze blowing
Turn up the island music like pirate radio
Yeah we got Chesney, Marley, Buffett like it love it
Harder than an oven but we make it cooler
Right here on that sunny side
Slice that bag of penguin ice and shake it in the cooler
It's all good yeah it's alright
It's just like everything we do
We make it cooler yeah yeah yeah
We make it cooler yeah yeah yeah
Got some sunset flamingo beach towels
Let's lay'em out on the living room floor
Strap on your black bikini
And I'll grab my surfer shorts
I'll be popping open that freezer
Trying to get my whole face inside
Fogging up these Ray-Bans
While you're cutting up the limes
There's heat advisory
Hundred degrees humidity
But with Dekoreas we make it cooler
Right here on that sunny side
Slice that bag of penguin ice
And shake it in the cooler
It's all good yeah it's alright
It's just like everything we do
We make it cooler, yeah yeah yeah
We make it cooler, yeah yeah yeah
Later tonight
Turn out the lights
Speed on the porch
By the tiki torch
You got me, I got ya
Hakuna matata
Hot like enchiladas but
We still make it cooler
Right here on that sunny side
Slice that bag of penguin ice
And shake it in the cooler
It's all good, yeah, it's alright
It's just like everything we do
We make it cooler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We make it cooler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cooler, yeah yeah yeah
Cooler, yeah yeah yeah
