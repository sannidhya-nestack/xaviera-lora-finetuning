Honey tea and hibiscus make my garden fine
Sugar candy dreams and some of the colors online
Love's tripping me up I et my words
Love's tripping me up I et my plans
Love's tripping me up I et the routine
Love's tripping me up I et myself
Honeysuckle, chrysanthemum make the hedge align
Two sugars, a cream, the tea tastes so like wine
Primroses and daisies look right but they don't rhyme
You and me we also look right but we don't chime
Love's tripping me up, I et my words
Love's tripping me up, I et my plans
Love's tripping me up, I et the routine
Love's tripping me up, I et myself
Laughs, tripping me up, I et my words
Laughs, tripping me up, I et my plans
Laughs, tripping me up, I et the routine
Laughs, tripping me up, I et myself
