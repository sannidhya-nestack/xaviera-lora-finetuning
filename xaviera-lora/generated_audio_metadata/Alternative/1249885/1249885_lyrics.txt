Love on my mind, I can't shake this feeling
Day and night it's you I'm seeing
Never leaving
Love on my mind
Blood's beating fast
Time's slipping by
Hope it will last
In your eyes I see our future
With each touch moments grow richer
Love on my mind was beating fast
Time slipping by, hope it will last
With all my might can't shake this feeling
Day and night, it's you I'm seeing
Never leaving, never leaving, never leaving
Love on my mind
Hearts beating fast, hearts beating fast
Time slipping, been by, hope it will last
Hope it will last in your eyes
Ain't no rest
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm
