Wide awake
Wish that I could sleep
I'm staring at the ceiling
Woke up from this dream
Woke up I was screaming
I've got this sinking feeling
Oh, oh baby you should be next to me
So where can you be?
Yeah, where can you be?
It was one, two, three o'clock in the morning
My heartbeat is a code, this is my SOS
Yes this is an emergency
Oh, oh, baby, you should be next to me
You should be next to me
When I get up in the morning
I wanna feel you next to me
Oh yeah
When I get home in the evening
I wanna feel you next to me
It was one, two, three o'clock in the morning
And my blood is running cold
This is my SOS
I've got this case of jealousy
Oh, oh baby
You should be next to me
You should be next to me
Oh woah
Then I get up in the morning, I wanna feel you next to me
Then I get home in the evening, I wanna feel you next to me
Oh, baby, you should be next to me
Oh, baby, you should be next to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
You should be next to me, oh
Oh, baby, you should be next to me
