Well the sun's burning bright in the sky And it ain't never been this nice
So we're taking the jeep for a ride
Let's take the top and the doors off
Now I'm feeling the breeze just to roll
You and me
Let's take the top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
You and me driving on the back roads
Got the speaker bumping, playing all our favorite songs
Just the tank top and a pair of jeans on
The top and the doors closed
Now I'm feeling the breeze, just the road
You and me, yeah
The top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
Let's take the top and the doors off
