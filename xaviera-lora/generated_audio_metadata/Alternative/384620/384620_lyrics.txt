When I was a boy
Had no problems
And I was always in control
Life is just a game
No need to play to win
But I was always in control (and I loved it)
Angel,'cause I was always her,'cause I loved it
I'm a little angel
I was always in control
She is a child
Got no problems
And she's always in control
Life is just a game
No need to play to win
But she's always in control
She's an angel and she's always all of her
She's an angel
And she's always in control
Are they running?
There's nothing here worth running for
Then why are they fighting?
There's nothing here worth fighting for
And I love her
Oh she's an angel
And she's always
I love her
She's an angel
And she's always in control (oh she's so right)
Why are they running?
There's nothing here worth running for
And why are they fighting?
There's nothing here worth fighting for
