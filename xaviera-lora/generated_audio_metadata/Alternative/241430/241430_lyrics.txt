Sun is sinking to the water
Clouds are coming in
I'm looking into blue eyes
I'm watching over him
I'm brushing against new skin
Fallin' into love
I'm rollin' with the punches
Tryin' not to come undone while I'm
Watchin' him
Watchin' him, I'm watchin' him
I've run out of ink and paper
I'm writing letters in the sand
I'm declaring my heart while
Holding it in his hands and I'm
Watching him
I've been thinking, am I fine?
I'm wanting you
Am I seeing what I'm dreaming?
I'm needing you
I've been thinkin' ever before,'cause I'm watching you
Blue eyes melt into oceans
It's the rest that's fine by me, so
Let it go on my inhibitions
Being honest with my love
A vulnerable position
Try not to come undone, why?
Watching you, I'm watching you
I've been thinking, am I falling?
I'm wanting you (watching, watching)
Am I seeing what I'm dreaming?
I'm needing you
I've been thinking if I fall,'cause I'm wanting you
