Yesterday falls away like it always does
It's so late and we know
That we'll both be busted in a while
When we go back home
I don't care, it was all worth it
Had to sit through a long winded reprimand
Through a fit slammed a door
It was all pretend
Not much left I wasn't allowed to do
But sitting thin
About you
Not a shock
To be grounded
Their suspicions
Are well founded
What's the worst?
That could happen
Meet me at the underpass tonight
I'll be waiting
Everyone's wondering where you were this week
The softball team needs you back
It's a losing streak
Carol calls me to say
Stay away from you
What's going on?
I didn't know how it was for you
Until later on when I overheard Michelle
Tell her friends what your dad did to you
Not a shock to be grounded
Their suspicions are well founded
What's the worst that could happen?
What's the worst that could happen?
