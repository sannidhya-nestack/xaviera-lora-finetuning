And what I wouldn't give to find someone with no secrets to hide
What I wouldn't give to taste a love that doesn't go to waste
I say the things I should've said and lock your voice out of my head
But you lit up my sky and let me go
But don't you know that I'm still afraid of the night approach
I'm still afraid of the lonely broken road
Like a car on an empty street in park
Oh, I am deathly afraid of the dark
What if the lights go out?
And all that's left is the beating sound of an empty chest
Ghost from the past, my heart afraid of the dark
What I wouldn't say to hear true words, erasing all my fears
What I wouldn't say to feel anything from you that's real
I'm the fool that fell for it, but I refuse to feel regret
And finally I've taken steps to go
But don't you know that I'm still afraid of the night approach
I'm still afraid of the lonely broken road
Like a car on an empty street in park
Oh I am deathly afraid of the dark
What if the lights go out
And all that's left is a beating sound
Of empty chest ghosts from the past in my heart
I played to the whispers from your voice that say
It could've worked, I hope the ship was sinking
I took a dive and I'm swimming for the coast
But I'm still afraid of the night approach
I'm still afraid of the lonely broken road
I'm still afraid of the night approach
I'm still afraid of the lonely broken road
Like a car on an empty street in park
Oh I am deadly afraid of the dark
What if the lights go out?
And all that's left is the beating sound of an empty chest
Goes from the past to my heart
Free to the dark (Shine a light on, shine a light on, shine a light on)
Free to the dark (Shine a light on) (Shine a light on, shine a light on)
Free to the dark (Shine a light on), (Shine a light on), (Shine light on)
Free to the dark (Shine a light on), (Shine a light on), (Shine light on)
Free to the dark
