She has a heart but she can't use it
She won't let anyone abuse it
She says life can be simple or life can be tough
The world is yours you just don't take the wheel enough
Hold on too tight and you'll just slip away
If love gets in your way you have to move it
People try to tell me that it doesn't work that way
But they'll never get a chance to prove it
I need nothing, I need no one
My world does not belong to anyone
And I need nothing like the earth needs the sun
I want nothing, I need nothing, I need no one, no one
He is not brave, he is not bold
But he finds comfort in the cold
He says don't listen, don't listen, don't do what you're told
This is your world, it's your life, just take control
I need nothing, I need no one
And I'm just the same as anyone
When I don't care is when I have the most fun
I want nothing, I need nothing, I need no one, no one
And they say your fairy tales we call them lies
They leave no room for compromise
You can't be happy till you realise
That you've just got to get rid of all those stars in your eyes
I need nothing I need no one
My world will not be burned by anyone
King of my prison, I'm cold as a stone
So get out and shut the door, leave me alone
I don't need anything, I don't need anyone
Don't try to cage me in,'cause I will just run
I can't hurt you when you can't hurt number one
I need nothing, I need no one, no one
