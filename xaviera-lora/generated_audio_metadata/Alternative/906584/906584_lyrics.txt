Time flies, friends move on, people die
I wanna cry for all the change in my bones
Lips part, time heals wounds, new chapters start
I feel my heart
Beating through my bones
I miss how I jumped into things without a second glance
I want those pieces back
I want a second chance
I want a (ah) second chance
Minds grow, people come, people go
I wanna know how to take it all in
Bad news comes, feelings change
My body thrums, I feel I've been numb
From taking it all in
I miss how I jumped into things without a second glance
I want those pieces back
I want a second chance
I want a
Second chance
I bumped into an old friend today
The one that got away
I miss her all the time
But I'm glad she didn't stay
I like how I changed
Proud of who I am today
Proud of who I am today
I miss how I jumped into things without a second glance
I want those pieces back
I want a second chance
I want a
Second chance
I want a second chance
I want a
Second chance
