A little getaway, a little getaway
Anywhere we go, anywhere we go's a little getaway
Let's make some plans
Get some sand in our toes
Let's make some sweet memories on the road
A little getaway
A little getaway
Anywhere we go
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
A little getaway
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
Let's travel far
Touch each star on the way
Just feel the air, lose all cares today
A little getaway, a little getaway
Anywhere we go
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
A little getaway
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
The world is a surprise before our eyes
Let's get away, a little getaway
Anywhere we go, anywhere we goes
A little getaway, a little getaway
Anywhere we go, anywhere we goes
A little getaway, a little getaway
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
Anywhere we go's a little getaway
