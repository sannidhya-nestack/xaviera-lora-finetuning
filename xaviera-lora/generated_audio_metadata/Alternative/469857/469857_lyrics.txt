She don't know what she wants
She just needs to know what she wants
But she doesn't know how
Could she know how
Won't you please help her
Come on get up off your feet with me tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Tonight could be the last night
She don't know what she needs
She just needs to know what to need
But she doesn't know how
Could she know how
Won't you please help her
Come on get up off your feet with me tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Tonight could be the last night
Come on, get up off your feet with me tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Tonight could be the last night
Night could be the last night
Night could be the last night
She don't know what she wants
She just needs to know what she wants
But she doesn't know how
Could she know how?
Won't you please help her?
Come on, get up off your feet with me tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Tonight could be the last night
Come on, get up off your feet with me tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Tonight could be the last night
Night could be the last night
Night could be the last night
