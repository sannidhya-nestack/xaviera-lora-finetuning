To love you hard like we're lost in a dream
To dance in the rain when the sunlight beeps
To spin in circles hearts wild and free
To laugh till we cry just you and me
To chase every star make the night our own
To trace every line in a world unknown
These are the moments of a beautiful fever
These are the moments of love that's keeper
To paint the sky bright with colors that glow
To whisper secrets only we will know
To find joy in chaos so weird and sweet
To share our halt in this quirky retreat
To float on the dreams ride the waves of time
To sing every word in perfect rhyme
These are the moments so dear if I feel them
These are the moments of love that's keeper
So let's find a way to lens unknown
With laughter as our guide, you're never alone
These are my moments of beautiful fever
These are the moments of love that's a keeper
