The darkness inside
I feel it take my life and make me realize
I'm not alone in this
Soon my hand will rise
To those things I've never tried
Does this make me vile?
Or turn a frown to smile
Say and a, say and a, say and a
That's tonight, say with me now
Hold it tight, don't leave out of sight
It will change you through the night
The darkness comes alive
Hold me tight, don't leave out of sight
It has chained me through the night
The darkness will survive this sight
