Okay, I'm back
Now get your train off my track
And here's a little feedback for you
This is how it is, skin for skin
Stand up, stand up
Was just a little mix up
A place we had to fix up right now
This is how it is, skin for skin
Here comes memory, here she comes
You said goodbye
You finally felt your heart cry
You finally felt your heart crack into
This is how it is, skin for skin
Here comes memory, dancing in with a grin
You made me crawl, you made me spin, you've taken it all
Further along we gather within
Here comes memory, here she comes
Okay, get back
You finally felt your heart crack
You finally felt your heart crack in two
This is how it is, skin for skin
Here comes memory, dancing in with a grin
This is how it is, skin for skin
Here comes memory, here she comes, here she comes
