Fork
You sucked the life from my skull
Creating my disease
Taking this life you did not own
Is that what I need?
No indication
Moral implication
Chained to my hand and knee
More satisfaction
Through your elevation
Now do you wanna hear me breathe?
Hear me breathe (hear me breathe)
Hear me breathe (hear me breathe)
Hear me please
Drink the poison and my world slowly sinks into
A helpless state of mind
As I'm giving in to you
This poison takes my life
And leaves me at my will
I sip with you in silence
We're breathing perfectly
Perfectly still
Licking your hand of affliction
Embedding me with your sin
Erecting a fist through my soul
A week before you to begin
Got no passion of our perversion
You beg and plead limitations of your asmic sensation
But you turn it on to see me bleed
See me bleed, see me bleed, see me bleed
Oh, bleed by the day, bleed by the day, bleed by the day
I'll just sing my blues, bleed by the day, you can sing my blues
Drink the poison out of my world
Slow mistakes then do
I'll have this state of mind as I'm healed
This poison takes my mind
And leads me up a well
I sit with you in silence
We're playing perfectly still
Sleep away
Drink the poison and my world
Slowly sinks into
A helpless state of mind
As I'm giving in to you
This poison takes my mind
And leaves me out of my mind
But I'll sit with you in silence
The pain of people still
Drink the poison
Drink the poison and the world
Drink the poison
The world sings with you
Trick the poison out of my world
Trick the poison out of my world
