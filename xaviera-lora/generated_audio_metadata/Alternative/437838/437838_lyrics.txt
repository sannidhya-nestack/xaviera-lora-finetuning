One more cold debate
It sure won't change the fate of one who sleeps on old newspapers in the streets
Never left square one
Let's draw a line and keep the dirt on us
Save this mess like we burned
Let's go, let's see the truth we know
I know it's in there somewhere
What will it take to turn the tide?
Words and empty phrases just for show
Or is it just me who has grown way too cynical
Somewhere down the line
Will we wake up
Will we still have the time
Money get away
I don't et to pay
We own you now
No questions asked and you're okay
Can't help but see the oppressive tendencies
What we know, know they all was right
We've helped them out in the past
Let's go, let's change the truth
We know, I know it's in there somewhere
What will it take to turn the tide
Words and empty phrases'cause for sure
Or is it just me who has grown way too cynical
Somewhere down the line
Will we wake up
Will we still have the time
Yeah, words and empty phrases just don't show
Or is it just me who has grown way too cynical
Somewhere down the line
Will we wake up? Will we still have the time?
