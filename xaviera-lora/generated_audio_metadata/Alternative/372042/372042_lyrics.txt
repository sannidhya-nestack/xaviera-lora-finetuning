Nothing up out in the front yard
Nothing up out in the back
Afternoon sun on the living room rug
Dog curled up with the cat
Got nothing to do
Skip stretched out in the back room
G's stacking Z's in the front
And I'm reflecting on time slow passing
Dreaming on days in the sun
With nothing to do
I got nothing to do
I got nothing to do
You got nothing to do
Got nothing to do
And there's nothing to do
