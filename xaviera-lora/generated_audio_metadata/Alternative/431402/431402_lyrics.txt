(Yes, yes, yes)
(Oh, yeah)
Calm me down
I can't play by myself
Calling distant words on the telephone
Washing different faces
In the glass
Caught out
In the snow
Summer rain
Human flesh
Come down
Call me a dumb
But they're meaner than a heart
My only hope
Wishing different words were spoken
Grand familiar places
They were my eyes and every smell in this woods brings back memories of a human flood
Calm down
Calm it down, let me know I'm a calming hero
Calm down, calm me down
Simulating your love into myself
Now calm down, calm me down
I'm trying to hang up
Where's my cell, cell, cell, cell?
