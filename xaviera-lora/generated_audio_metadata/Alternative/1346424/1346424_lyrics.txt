I've had enough
I feel you flooding in my mind
It's all messed up
I'm here while you now live my life
I'm tired of these days
What do I do to get through to you
Compulsion reach out ahead
When you hold me back instead
I can't get back on my feet
With you hanging over me
Compulsion reach out ahead
Can't get out of my bed
I wanna get back on my feet
When you let go of me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
I feel so tired
But there is nothing I can do
I feel so lost
And I have lost my mind in you
I'm tired of these games
What do I do to get through to you?
Compulsion reach out ahead
When you hold me back instead
I can't get back on my feet
With you hanging on for me
Compulsion reach out ahead
I can't get out of my bed
I wanna get back on my feet
When you let go of me
Get off me, get off me, get off me, get off me
Can't push and reach out ahead
When you hold me back instead
Can't get back on my feet
With you hanging over me
Can't push and reach out ahead
Can't get out of my bed
Wanna get back on my feet
When you let go of me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
Get off me
