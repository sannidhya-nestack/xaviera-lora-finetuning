In the stillness of the night I hear your voice
Whispers of a love that's lost a distant noise
We built our world on dreams that never came
Now we're chasing shadows, playing a lonely game
Oh, when the rain falls down and the sky turns grey
You'll find your way back, but I won't stay
In the silence of the storm, I'll be free
Dreaming of the love that's meant to be
Every promise that we made is fading fast
Like the echoes of a song, a otten past
We tried to hold on tight but love slipped away
Now we're left with broken dreams and words we couldn't say
Oh when the rain falls down and the sky turns grey
You'll find your way back
But I won't stay in the silence of the storm
I'll be free, dreaming of a love that's meant to be
And the thunder rolls as our hearts collide
We were caught in the storm
With no place to hide
But now I see the truth
In the lightning flash
We were never meant to last
Just a spark that couldn't catch
Oh when the rain falls down
And the sky turns grey
You'll find your way back
But I won't stay
In the silence of the storm
I'll be free
Dreaming of a love that's meant to be
So walk away with my head held high
Knowing in my heart it's time to say goodbye
And as the rain falls down I'll find my peace
In the dreams of the love that sets me free
So I walk away with my head held high
We were caught in the storm with no place to hide
But now I see the truth in the lightning's flash
We were never meant to last, just a spark that couldn't catch
