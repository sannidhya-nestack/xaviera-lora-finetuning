There's a place we want to go
But we got no money
And there's a house we want to buy
And even after all these years
You call me honey
You keep our happiness alive
And I wanna buy you a new diamond ring
A house on an island, a bird that can sing
Let's live our last days in glory
et all these tired years
We've got a beautiful story
A bottle that's full of tears
I have so many broken dreams
The trail behind me
They pull me back into the past
You can help me run away
Where they'll never find me
Where we can make the morning last
I feel like I failed you
I feel like I'm done
There's no fight left in me now
Let's live our last days in glory
et all these tired years
We've got a beautiful story
A bottle that's full of tears
Grow old with me
Grow old with me
Please grow old with me
And live our last days in glory
et all these tired years
We've got a beautiful story
A bottle that's full
A bottle that's full
A bottle that's full of tears
