Today I woke, find the sun unraised in their hand
I finally choked on the words that I can't say
Yesterday's dying, tomorrow cannot live
And I can't bring myself to say
Hello my dear
These days are getting longer and the skies are clear
The stars are burning bright and just take my hand
I'll try hard not to tremble just please don't step out of the light
Don't step out of the light
Well, I heard a song the other day
Reminding me of a time when everything was okay
And I, I starve at night just to feel alive
Oh, wherein God's name is that voice that I can't find
And when the day slips from my grasp
Well I turn my head and laugh and hope to see you smile
And every color turns to grey
Well I've been hoping and praying that you will come to say
Hello my dear
These days are getting longer and the skies are clear
The stars are burning bright and just take my hand
I'll try hard not to tremble just please don't step out of the light
Don't step out of there
And I won't sleep when I get home
I just keep checking the phone
To see if you haven't called another thousand times
And I won't breathe this life away
I know you're not here to stay
And I won't waste my breath
If you're not here at all
Alone my dear
These days are getting longer and the skies are clear
Stars are burning bright and just take my hand
I'll try not to tremble just please don't step out of the light
Please don't step out of the light
And just please don't step out of the light
No don't, no don't, don't step out of the light
