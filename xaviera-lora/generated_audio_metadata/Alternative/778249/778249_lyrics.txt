When everything is black, the tempest comes
Pray it brings me sweet oblivion
Shelter me softly, spirit of rain
Help me et his deafening way
Memory clings, its steady black tide
Holds me in sway
Won't let me hide, let me hide
When everything is black, the tempest comes
Pray it brings me sweet oblivion
Follow me, faithless, torrent of clouds
Under the sapphire, remnants all drown
A heart that feels nothing has never been pained
If I ride the storm surge, will I be brave?
When all the light is gone, the tempest comes
Sink into its mind,'til I am gone
I'll float on indigo waves
Far away from all fears
I'll sail the atmosphere
When everything is black
The tempest comes
Pray it brings me sweet oblivion
When everything is black, the tempest comes
Way it brings me sweet oblivion
