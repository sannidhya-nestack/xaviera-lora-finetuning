I'm so bitter by your tongue
But I can't buy without you
Holding hands could make this hard
Twist it up inside you
All the best is all for worst
But I can't breathe without you
You do it once and twice, et
The second time reminds you
And you get tired of making friends
But they get by without you
And on my left you can't depend
We all survives a lot too
A new day, a new way, an old face, an okay, a new wave
And I see, an old face, a heartbreaker
How does it feel to be down on your knees again?
All for best is all for worst
And heaven knows you don't come first
A new day, a new way, an old face, an okay
A new wave, and I say, an old fake
A heartbreaker, how does it feel
To be down on your knees
Tell me how does it feel
To be down on your knees again
Run again, hey
