I think that I want you for myself
I know it sounds selfish
But so what, so what
I held my dream
Patiently
Later on
Stick around
Stay with me
And we're both crazy
And we know it
And the people think out loud
So what, so what?
I held my dream patiently
Later on, stick around, stay with me
I think that I want you for myself
I know it sounds selfish but so what?
So what?
I have my dreams
Patiently
Later on
Stick around
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
