Hello mister, hello sir, did it ease your mind?
Make the day go by, there's nothing to see
I'll be friendly, I ain't trying to serve in a way
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, I might get in trouble, don't be kind with me
I can take what I deserve, I'm a hit-or-miss child
Full of trouble, temporary, just to start their lives
I'm the best in this position, never good for you
Let me prove it to you, I'll blow you away, oh
I'm just a messenger of music
Set aside and call me what you want
Tell me why, tell me
I'm just a messenger to bring you satisfaction
Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Make me fake, I promise you'll be happy
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm just a messenger, refuses self-assertion
Call me what you want, tell me what you need
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, I might get in trouble
Don't be kind with me
I can take what I deserve
I'm here for the job
Full time or temporary
Just sit back, relax
I'm the best in this position
Put your dreams on hold
Baby, lose the fold
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In the next few moments, oh, oh, oh
Watch me work on something that really shows
I'm just a messenger to bring satisfaction
Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
I'm just a messenger, a musical symbol, servant
Call me what you want, tell me what you need
Make me pay, God promise you'll be happy
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm just a messenger, to bring you satisfaction
Tell me what you want, tell me what you need
