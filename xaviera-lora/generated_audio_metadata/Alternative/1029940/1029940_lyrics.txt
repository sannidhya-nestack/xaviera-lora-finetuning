I'm counting cracks on your dry and droopy lips
You're bending to grip a firelight and a sandal stick
We finish our wine and maybe have something more
I am not sure
I'm cutting cracks on your dry and choppy lips
Dry and choppy lips
Drying choppy lips are sliding down my skin
It doesn't move me but I feel a resolution
In the sky it's burning black holes in my eyes
And I am drowning in your dreams
(Giving her love)
And I'm pretending how it feels
(He's the liar)
I see the world distorted in your eyes
I see the world distorted in your eyes
I came alone
I come and start a play
I come alone
I come right away
And I am drowning in your dreams (getting higher)
And I'm pretending how it feels
And I am drowning in your dream
And I'm pretending
And I'm pretending how it feels
