Feels like an angel crying
Feels like the hopeless trying
Feels like a wandering eye watches over me
And I can see
It's been a while, but it's no use
Will I ever find the truth
I keep looking around, but I should be looking inside
And I wonder why
I've got all kinds of reasons, things to believe in
But I've got a long, long way to go
I've got all kinds of seasons, to live and breathe in
But I've got a long, long way to go, to go
Everything's so contrary
Such a weight to carry
Will I ever find a peace of mind
Anywhere it hides
It's like a lie, and in some way
You think that everything's okay
Something's always wrong, something always breaks
And I'm not gonna let it stay
I've got all kinds of reasons and things to believe in
But I've got a long, long way to go
I've got all kinds of seasons to live and breathe in
But I've got a long, long way to go
And how long must I wait
For some way that you let me down
And how long must I wait
For you to come around
And how long must I wait
For some way that you'll let me down
And how long must I wait
For you to save me
Save me
I've got all kinds of reasons and things to believe in
And I got a long, long way to go
I got all kinds of seasons to live and breathe in
And I got a long, long way to go
