Another Saturday, I know too well
These calls are killing me, am I in hell?
Your words overshadowing, my thoughts are still
There is no other way
Out of this kill, don't make me say
Those words I hate, don't make a scene
This is just my way of breaking free
From your day to day misery
I've got nowhere to breathe
Choking in my shell
Put me out of my misery
No more tales to tell
I've got one last chance
One last tell
Do you hear this silence?
It's a mercy kill, don't make me say
Those words I hate, don't make a scene
This is just my way of breaking free
From your day to day misery
Don't make me say those words I hate
Don't make a scene, this is just my way
Of breaking free from your day to day misery
Don't make me say those words I hate
Don't make a scene
This is just my way of breaking free
From your day to day misery
I will never say those words I hate
I won't make a scene
This is just my way
I'm breaking free from the day to day misery
