A quick stare as if it were a loaded gun
At worst I'm treated
I'm meant to break all ties but I've finally reached the point
You feel the need to turn a purpose like a disease
I won't break
Show me how it's really done
Just like you've stated
I won't ever be held down
Proving what you are is simply monotone
I don't wanna be left out again
Rid me of this veil
I don't wanna be left out
I'll trade for something real, yeah
A mere taste, it kills you now you're on the run'til it has faded
Just one look from those eyes and I'll face the moment's end
You steal your feet, my aching to be released
I set fate looking out for number one a point well it's again
I won't ever be held down
I'm a geostar cast a kind of tone
I don't wanna be left out again rid me of this spell
I don't wanna be left out I'll trade for something real yeah
Thought, fear, it seems you went from all to none, it's self created
Survival is implied now, it really does depend
I don't wanna be left out again, read me out this veil
I don't wanna be left out, I'll trade for something real, yeah
I don't wanna be left out again, read me out this veil
I don't wanna be left out, I'll trade for something real, yeah
Baby, I love you, baby (baby, I love you, baby)
Baby, I love you, baby (baby, now)
