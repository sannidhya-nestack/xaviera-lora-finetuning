It's not so bad alone
My fridge makes a noise
That lets me know I'm home
And the milk in my bones
Says this isn't the darkest night I've known, I know
That this isn't the darkest night I've known
I'd walk some miles to sleep
But there's nowhere to run
And the lights on my street
And my shoe at the stone
Says this isn't the darkest night I've known
I know
That this isn't the darkest night I've known
I know
That this isn't the darkest night I've known
And this is where I'll lie this whole night
The fire and the sight through no light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide
It's not so bad alone
The crack in my wall
Let's me know I've grown
stronger winds have blown
And this isn't the darkest night I've known, I know
This isn't the darkest night I've known, I know
But this isn't the darkest night I've known
And this is where I'll lie this whole night
The fire and the sight through no light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide
In silence, I'm silently writing
Untitled, half-lighted
Burns brighter in the silence of the light
And this is where I'll lie this whole night
The fire and the safe through low light
And this is where I'll hide
And this is where I'll hide
