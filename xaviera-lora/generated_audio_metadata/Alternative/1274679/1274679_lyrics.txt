Phone rings in the morning, everyday
You're burning me slowly, taking away
Here in the dark now, I'm losing my way
But I couldn't stay, I couldn't wait
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
Phone rings in the morning, everyday
You're burning me slowly, taking away
Here in the dark now, I'm losing my way
But I couldn't stay, I couldn't wait
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do without me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, tell me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, tell me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, tell me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, tell me
