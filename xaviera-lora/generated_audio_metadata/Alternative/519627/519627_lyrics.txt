Most of all, I hate the part where I keep my cool, shut out my heart
It's a stupid game, but I don't wanna play
There's a place where I can go, where I'm the star and it's my show
And nobody can tell me what to say
I'm gonna turn up loud and rock the band
With my guitar, some booze and a one night stand
'Cause I'm a dying bar rockstar
All the lights are on me
Yeah I'm a dying bar rockstar
Get all my drinks for free
Yeah I'm a dying bar rockstar
Dying bar rockstar
Don't look back, avoid the trap
I tell myself it's useless crap
But in the end I just fall anyway
I'll be happy soon enough
When I free myself from all this stuff
And let the music drown it all away
I can't wait to turn up loud and rock the band
With my guitar, some booze and a one night stand
'Cause I'm a die-hard rockstar
All the lights are on me
And I'm a die-hard rockstar
Getting all my drinks for free
And I'm a die-hard rockstar
Die-hard rockstar
That I'm a Tiber Rushstar, Tiber Rushstar
