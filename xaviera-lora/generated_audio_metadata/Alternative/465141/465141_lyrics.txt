Why are you so out of reach?
Never practice what you preach
And if my shadow turns around
Hope my feet don't fail me now
Paper heights to walk away
Scissor comes and saves the day
Take my picture if you please
I think I'm turning Japanese
Ooh la la la la la la la
Yes I'm in the way
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, breakaway
If you think of breaking up
We will catch you there's no doubt
If you think of moving on
You'll be back it won't be long
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
As I break away
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
As I break away
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
As I'm away
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Break away
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
As I'm away
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
