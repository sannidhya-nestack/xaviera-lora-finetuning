He puts out his cigarette and hides it from his Juliet
He loves her so he doesn't want her to know
He's not the guy she thought she knew
She took a chance and their emotions grew
A year went by and they're going out
It's going great and they had no doubts
Just a boy in a band who her father couldn't stand
But she took a chance
And now her world is crashing down
Treading in the deep and waiting to drown
He loves her with all his heart
But knew it wouldn't work right from the start
He knows he wants to save
But says we should go our separate ways
This is the story of a guy who wants
To live all of his life without saying goodbye
And if she stays
He would treat her right, he'd choose every night if she falls
He would be there to catch her and never neglect her if she runs
He'd look all over the world and find this beautiful girl
He had promised Juliet he'd never smoke another cigarette
So that she left him just like he said she should
But if he could stop her, he knows he would
He's feeling alone and couldn't feed this addiction
Didn't pay the rent, hello eviction
Nothing he did before feels the same
So he's resorting to Mary Jane
But he's on tour and he's playing his hometown
He doesn't believe all he sees in the crowd
It's as Juliet now he feels in love again
Is never gonna ever have to pretend
She looks at him and smiles
And his heart stops for a while
She meets him backstage after the show
It's as her blade leaves tomorrow
He lets her stay and they agree
To never go their separate ways
And if she stays
He will treat her right, each and every night if she falls
He will be there to catch her and never neglect her if she runs
He'll look all over the world to find his beautiful girl
He had promised Juliet he'd never smoke another cigarette
He puts out his cigarette and hides it from his Juliet
He loves her so he doesn't want her to know
It's just a boy in a band
Who her father couldn't stand
And if she stays
He would treat her right, he'd shoot every night and if she falls
He would be there to catch her and never neglect her if she runs
He'll look all over the world to find his beautiful girl
He had promised Juliet he'd never smoke another cigarette
He had promised Juliet he'd never smoke another cigarette
