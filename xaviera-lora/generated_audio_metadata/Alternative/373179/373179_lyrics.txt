Lonely, the nights became so lonely
The treasures of the city
Hidden behind the closed windows
Hearts broken mirrors
Lonely reflections falling down
Like a stone into the water
Stars are so close if you stand on the edge
Leave me alone
What did you mean when you said to me
Leave me alone
When you said I must be strong
I lost you all
But I can't be always wrong
What did you mean?
Come down
The world is turning round, you know
I thought you were the one
A hero, angel, from me
The action is over, resurrection
The lights are going out
Stars are so close if you stand on the edge
Leave me alone
What did you mean when you said to me
Leave me alone
When you said I must be strong
I lost you all
But I can't be always wrong
What did you mean?
Lonely
The nights became so lonely
The nights became so lonely
The nights became so lonely
Lonely
