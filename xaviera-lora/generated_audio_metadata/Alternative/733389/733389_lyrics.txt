Take me home sometime, driver
See what I've done
Whole lot of nothing
Let's ride sometime, driver
Warm my head
Frozen hands, it's all that I have
Change your mind and you're gone again
Is this time for real? Just pretend
Whole lot of nothing
Whole lot of nothing
A lot of nothing
Some time driver
Change your mind and you're gone again
Is this time for real?
Just pretend
A lot of nothing
A lot of nothing
A lot of nothing
What am I supposed to do?
