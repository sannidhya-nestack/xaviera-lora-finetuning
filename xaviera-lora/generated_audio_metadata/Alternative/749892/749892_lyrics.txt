Look on the sand, my boy
Where is your friend?
What did she lose?
Where these men's homes are from?
Why is the sand here?
Also compelled to smoke
When we'll come back to that town
I will stay alone as usual
It's useful to wait to lay your gloves down before me
Boom of your car
Oh, we run wild and I run too fast
My arm was falling down on the floor
I will teach you how to turn back
We were surrounded by the storm
Love, dealer and the four days are gonna sleep on the ride, yeah
Who kept us safe, Ben, Ben, I wish you'd leave
I'm scared to count your desk, do you believe
The sand is falling on our floor
I had a dream you all break down
Oh, we were lying around so fast
My arm was falling down on a foul wall
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I was such a cry star that turned black
We were surrounded by lights twilight
Love dealer, I'm the flower, days are gonna sleep on the rack, shit, shit, shit, shit
