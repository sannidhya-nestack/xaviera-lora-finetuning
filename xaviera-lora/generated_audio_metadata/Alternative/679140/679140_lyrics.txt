A voice on the telephone, a dream in the night, another evening spent alone
Another wish that fades from sight
The days begin to look the same
Can you hear me call your name
When you're coming home
When you're coming home
I'm missing you
Can't stand these days apart
I'm missing you
Can't take this broken heart
I'm missing you
Tell me what to do
Oh, tell me
don't you know I'm missing you?
Tell me are you missing me too?
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Letters sent from far away
I read a thousand times
It doesn't matter what they say
I always read between the lines
I'm looking out my window now
But it's only a shadow now
When you're coming home
When you're coming home
Oh, I'm missing you
Can't stand this day's war
I'm missing you
Can't take this broken heart
I'm missing you
Tell me what to do, oh tell me
don't you know I'm missing you
Tell me are you missing me
dreams can't help me now, no, no
I need to feel your sweetness washing over me
Won't you hurry home, oh
don't you know I'm missing you
Missing you
I'm missing you
I can't stand it, no, no
Don't you know I'm missing you
Missing you
Oh, missing you
Washing over me
Oh, don't you know I'm washing all over me
I can't take it when you're far away, oh
Washing all over me
Washing all over me (I'm missing you)
Washing all over me
Washing all over me (I'm missing you, oh)
Washing all over me
Washing all over me (my dreams can't help me now)
