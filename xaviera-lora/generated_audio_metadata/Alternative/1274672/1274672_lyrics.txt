Flying through the mountains
Flying through the sea
I feel like I'm homeless
Lonely in my dreams
Please come here and save me
Only for one night
That love that you gave me
Enough for both of us
Don't leave me alone
Let me be your home
Don't leave me alone
Let me be your home
without you I'm screaming
Louder, louder, louder
I've only got a few
But you wave me like
Louder, louder, louder
I've only got a few, but you make me like
Louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder
Flying through the mountains
Flying through the sea
I feel like I'm homeless
Lonely in my dreams
Please come here and save me
Only for one night
That love that you gave me
Enough for both of us
Don't leave me alone
Let me be your home
Don't leave me alone
Let me be your home
without you I'm screaming louder, louder, louder
I finally got up here, but you wake me like louder, louder, louder
I've only got a few
But you wave me like brother
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
