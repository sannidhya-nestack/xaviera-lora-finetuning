I don't know what you're talking'bout
No idea what you mean
You keep on talking out the side of your face and
It don't mean nothing to me
You should complain a lot
But you get the job done
I guess that that's good enough
The work ain't supposed to be fun
I know I'll never find anyone quite like you
To do the things you do
Like paying my bills
And filing my paperwork
And picking up my drive
I know I'll never find anyone quite like you
I know I'll never find anyone quite like you
To do the things you do
And I know I'll never find anyone quite like you
And I know I'll never find anyone quite like you
Time and time I try to find someone to replace you
But I don't wanna take the time to train somebody new
So I guess you do
Yeah I guess you do
