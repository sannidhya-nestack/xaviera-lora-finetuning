It's over man, from the first touch
It's over man
From the first touch, to my man
From the first touch, to my man
From the first touch, to my man
From the first touch, to my man
Once we talked of civilization
We claimed it was the goal
The grail of our endeavors
We dreamed of a future
Where we would all taste the sweet fruits
Of technological progress
But now, now, now
As we stand on the edge
Of another thousand years
We have no common dreams
We have no common dreams
There is a howling gulf
Between the future of our fantasies
And the real world we are creating
My world is immaculate
My world is controlled
Bring on the future
As it's now a flow
Bring on the future
Bring on the troll
No common dreams as is now of us, no
It's over, it's over
All I had was you and now it's over
It's over, it's over
All I had was you and now it's over
