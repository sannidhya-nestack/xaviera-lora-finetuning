Down at the market square
There were barber mates
And all were for me
A go to you
Down at the market square
What will you be wearing here
I know I'll never et
That pretty face
Love's raining over me
Lost, bleeding, over made
Found you at the town square
With your sailor mouth in the air
Slid between the coldest drops of rain
Crowd in the summer air
Hanging off the rails
And floating in the sea of anarchy
Love raining over me
Love laid it all on me
Got the laughter in the air
Magic in your hands
I ask God for another second chance
Hiding mountain square
Stars blind me with a glint
Shout out their broken promises
Where did you wind up? Where did you wind up?
Love's bleeding over me
Love's raining over me
Love's bleeding over me
Love's raining over me
