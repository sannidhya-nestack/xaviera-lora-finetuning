The dog walks, the cat talks
The bird sings, the bell rings
Talk to holes, smoke rolls
Burn like a candle, burn like a flame
Melt my troubles and melt my brain
Light up a picture outside the frame
That shows our lives and shows our pain
Blue skies and red eyes
Spark that thing like a light on the wind
Sweet highs at sunrise
Up in smoke and do it again
An answer's there
How have you been?
It's been such a long time without any sin
Follow the call, what's there to learn?
Give light to your heart, roll it and burn
Blue skies and red eyes spark that thing like a light on the wind
Sweet highs at sunrise, up in smoke and do it again
Show me the way, my friend, daylight, my day
I said, where has the time gone by? How will I realize?
Burn like a candle, burn like a flame
Melt my troubles and melt my brain
Light up the picture outside the frame
That shows our lives and shows our pain
Blue skies and red eyes
Spark that bang like the light on the wind
Sweet highs at sunrise
I'll fit smoke and do it again
Blue skies and red eyes
Spark that thing like a light on the wind
Sweet highs at sunrise
Hop in smoke and do it again
Burn like a candle
Burn like a flame
Burn like a candle
