I didn't et you
I didn't et you, she said
She put her hand down, lower than her eyes
She put her hand down, lower than her eyes
He won't et me, he won't et his scent
She shook her head and looked at the bright mountain top
She shook her head and looked at the bright mountain top
I can't go right off (I never have)
I can't go right off
The scripts of summer
The crown of lies
She's dancing on her grave
With dandelion wine
The scripts of summer
Tell you gossip
The crown of lies
And she has the new gossips
She's dancing on the whole grave (I'll tell you a gossip)
With Andelian (Let me tell you a gossip)
No, I'll shout in the face with a handbow
But nobody burned out till the end
Because they all thought it was a clever mask
But it's clever mask that men have on
I mean, I have to know she said
She started looking well-armed as you might well imagine
All of sudden my even became less adventurous
It was too easy to recognize her for what she had done
All this blood is not in time
All this blood is not in time
All this sand
The scripts of summer
Until you got there
The crown of lies (you have something about this)
She's dancing on her grave (I'll tell you a gossip)
With dandelion wine
The scripts of summer (I'll tell you gossip)
The crown of lies (she has a new obsess)
She's dancing on her grave (I'll tell you gossip)
With dandelion wine
