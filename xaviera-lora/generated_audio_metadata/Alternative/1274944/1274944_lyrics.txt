I don't recognize you in half light
You're like an angel whose wings were left by the roadside
We try to talk poetically
But we don't know beauty
Some try to educate me in the ways of being ordinary
And maybe my eyes are blind
I'd rather have these dreams than take them away from me
And I am your salvation
But I'm a hurricane with no direction
We'll sit here under the cherry tree
And nurture the dream here in the Elysium
We'll move by the light of fireflies
Please don't lose sight of the serenity
Maybe I'm here, I'll disappear
And maybe my eyes are blind
I'd rather have these dreams than take them away from me
And I am your salvation
But I'm a hurricane with no direction
And I am your salvation
But I'm a hurricane with no direction
I feel
Lonely in the half light
The no
Spirit flown forevermore
I am your salvation
But I'm a hurricane with no direction
And I am your salvation
But I'm a hurricane with no direction
Oh oh oh oh
I can't afford
