It must have been five days
Your love showered me like rain (hey hey)
Forever repeat offenders
But I knew from the start
We would fade from white to grey (hey hey)
Forever repeat offenders
If love could kill I've died a thousand times
But you make me die to feel alive
So high, so high, so high
I shout for the moon
And you give me all the stars
I don't sleep, I'm dreaming
When you make me breathe the real things
Crazy for you
But silently screams my heart
Don't let this heat go freezing
your Mars squares my Venus
Heavens help me now I've found
Your gravity is sweeping
Like a dead devil demon
I shout for the moon
Found you between the stars
What a story without an ending
Forever repeat offenders
Thrown like a paper plane
How I feel when we're face to face
Hey hey
Forever repeat offenders
If love could kill a thousand times
But you make me die to feel alive
So high, so high, so high
I shout for the moon
And you give me all the stars
I don't sleep, I'm dreaming
When you make me breathe the real thing
Crazy for you
But suddenly screams my heart
Don't let this heat go freezing
your Mars squares my Venus
Heavens help me now, I found
Your gravity is sweeping
Like a dead devil demon
I shout for the moon
Found you between the stars
We're a story without an ending
Forever a beat offender
Whoa, crazy for you tonight
You're so sick, still my best vaccine
Whoa, crazy for you tonight
Making love, making memories
If love could kill, I'd die a thousand times
But you make me die to feel alive
I shuffle the moon (hey) and you give me all the stars
I don't sleep, I'm dreamin' when you make me breathe
And if I'm crazy for you, let's silently squeeze my heart
Don't let this heat go freezin'cause your Mars squares my Venus
I shuffle the moon
And you give me all the stars
I don't sleep, I'm dreaming
When you make me breathe the real things
Crazy for you
But silently screams my heart
Don't let this heat go freezing
your Mars squares my Venus
Heavens help me now
Heavens help
Your gravity is sweeping
Like a dead devil demon
I shout for the moon
Found you between the stars
We're a story without an ending
Forever repeat offenders
