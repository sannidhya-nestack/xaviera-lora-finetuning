Why don't you just go away?
It's not like you owe me anything anyway
You make me sick
With the cards you play
And your dirty tricks
I can't believe I'm wasting on you
This perfectly good melody
What can I say
When it makes me feel a little closer to okay
Do the world a favour, pull the trigger on yourself
The things you say, they'll go away
Do the world a favour, take the short trip to hell
The things you do, they'll come back to you
Why can't you just get a clue
Do I have to spell it out
F-U-C-K-O-F-F
You make me wanna shout
What can I say about yours truly
I'm usually live and let live love
But your bullshit it makes me angry
And now I want, I wanna let it out
Do the world a favour, put the trigger on yourself
The things you say, they'll go away
Do the world a favour, take the short trip to hell
The things you do, they'll come back to you
I hate you with a passion
Created by your actions
Through this release my anger
God help me rise above
Why don't you just go away
It's not like you owe me anything anyway
You make me sick
All the games you play
And your dirty tricks
Do the world a favor
Put the trigger on yourself
The things you say
They'll go away
Do the world a favor
Take the short trip to hell
The things you do
They'll come back to you
