Skies frozen still, grey against the steel
Found my lover still, asleep against the wheel
Across the broken hills, stone against water
I found my lover's hill, the engine running hotter
He told me, be still, be free
He holds me, we run on empty
I'm falling too deep, too fast, I'm dreaming
One more, one last valley cannot hold
A storm we've never seen, see the clouds unfold
Come to wash us clean
Inside a frozen truck
He's got no heat to spare
We've always been stuck
Somewhere next to nowhere
He told me
Be still, be free
He holds me
We run on empty and falling too deep, too fast
Dreaming one more, one last
We don't need to wait
We don't need to wait
We don't need to wait
We don't need to wait
To hold me, be still, be free
He holds me, we run on empty
I'm falling today too fast
I'm dreaming one more one last
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
