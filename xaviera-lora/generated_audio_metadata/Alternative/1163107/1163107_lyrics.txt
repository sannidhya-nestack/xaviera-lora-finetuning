Let's go, get rolling, this is the day
I'd walk a thousand miles, I'm there, you best believe
No destination is ever too far
Oh, we can handle more, the synergy's forming
Drop of a head
We're headed your way
Emotions are ablaze with tons to spare
Now we've arrived it's okay
That's right guaranteed
We're here to represent just watch it all unveil
The floor is yours
The floor is yours
The floor is yours
The floor is yours
The floor is yours, the floor is yours, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, the floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours The floor is yours
The floor is yours, the floor is yours
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sound waves exploding, you will too too
stopping would start it and it just gets better
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
The curtain's up, it's underway
Bow bang, a shine that blinds you
It feels unbelievable
Where would you rather be?
And we shop, get you the front line
We've known it all along
So incredible, yeah, it's what we wanted, yeah, well now we got it
Can we relive today? The pot of gold (the pot of gold)
The floor is yours, the floor is yours
The floor is yours, the floor is yours
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Sound waves exploding, you will too too
something gets better and it just gets better
Whoa
The end we shot could stay
Can't even think about it
So sad to walk away
I've been feeling such a daze without it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
