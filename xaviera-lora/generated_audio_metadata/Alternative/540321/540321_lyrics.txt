I love all men
Always breathing
Her eyes on me
Understanding
No one dead believer
No one heater
Warning world in her dreams
Shaken, broken, dry streams
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take me, yes, take me
Your love light
Save me, yes, save me
From dawn time
Always breathing
Her heart lights up the shore
Black sea lost all the drift no more
Take me, yes take me, your love
Yeah, save me from dawn's eye
Take me, save me, save me, save your loved ones
