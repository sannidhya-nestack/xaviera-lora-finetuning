Never ask the real reason why
There's no need to ever know
Words are sharpened knives
Carving truth from lies
When your heart's exposed
If I'd foreseen the storm we'd bring
Or all the promises we'd sever
But no one could know the weather
I keep you safe from suffering
Sheltered in our arms together
But nobody lives forever
When you're with me there's no thought of time
And the moonlight is so kind
But tomorrow comes with no care for tonight, tonight
If I'd foreseen what storm would bring
Or all the promises we'd sever
But no one can know the weather
If I'm never to shine again
I'm filled with all the light you've given
Nobody lives forever
We can leave this lonely place
Live among the falling stars
Never wonder what we are
And we never have to say
Goodbye, goodbye
The final scene the storm would bring
Were all the promises we'd sever
And no one could know the weather
To keep you safe from suffering
Sheltered in our arms together
Nobody lives forever
If I'm never to shine again
I'm filled with all the light truth's given
But nobody lives forever
