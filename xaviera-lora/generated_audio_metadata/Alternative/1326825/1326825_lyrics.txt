Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Some people wanna take it slow
I'm gonna rock it all night though
I'm gonna let my hair down low
Down to the flow
You know it's sweet, you know it's sticky
Mm, it's tasty and it's sticky
A little fizzy, a little tingly
Are you with me?
Raspberry chocolatini
Hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Take a dip, let me get you wet
Drip, drip, let me make you sweat
You can get it any way you want
Any way you want
Shakin' I'll stir
Pinky I'll make'em slur
Oh yeah now it's my turn
When I do it I make it burn
Raspberry chocolatini
Hot bikini, I stay steamy
Little cocktail in my hand
Yeah, I got it on demand
Slide it over, let it splash
Velvet kisses, midnight flash
You and me in velvet scenes
Dancing through our sugar dreams
So sip it slow or chug it fast
This kind of love is built to last
Raspberry lips are chocolate teas
Come on baby, drink up the breeze
Raspberry
Chocolatini
Come on baby
I'm so dreamy
Raspberry
Chocolatini
Come on baby
I'm so dreamy
Raspberry, cioccolatini
Come on baby, I'm so dreamy
