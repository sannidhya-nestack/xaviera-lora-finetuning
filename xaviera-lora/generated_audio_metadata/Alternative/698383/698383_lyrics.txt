Is this all a dream that I imagined up
Or did I drink your poison
Always thought that love would be so magical
Now trapped inside your prison
But you must be mistaken me for someone else
Tied up on your puppet string
My heart will not be tethered to your broken words
So you can just leave
I've given this a shot for love
But I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm not the girl you're thinking of
Just walk out that door
After all the tears I've cried I'm giving up
This love is such a mystery
You know I gave you my heart and spilled my blood
And this is not how you repay me
But you must think of someone else
I've given this a shot for love
But I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm not the girl you're thinking of
Just walk out that door
I used to think this was a dream
My lovely little fantasy
But now I see it's a nightmare
I've given this a shot for love
But I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm not the girl you're thinking of
Just walk out that door
I've given it a shot for love
But I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're not the man I'm thinking of
Just walk out that door
