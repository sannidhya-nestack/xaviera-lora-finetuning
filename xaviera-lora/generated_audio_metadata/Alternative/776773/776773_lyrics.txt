Glide my eyes and look through the sky
Never see the darkness shining
Catch the comet that passes by and I can
Be what I want to with you
I search for my endless cloud without me
You're everlasting (everlasting)
And who can tell why I have this down?
No, I can't be what I want to
Sweetened in style
Out of sight
Sweetened in style
Come out where you hide and shine so bright
Breathe while all the clean air is left on a fly
Until my wings stay till now and has reached a step
That I can be what I want soon
Sweet in style
Out of sight
Sweet in its time
Come out where you hide and shine so bright
Out
Don't ever say I told you so
Open the door and breathe me in
You'll find you've always been right
You've always been right there
Sweet hidden star (I'm the light)
Sweet hidden star (Shine so bright)
Come out where you hide and it shines so bright
Come out where you hide and it shines so bright
Come out where you hide and it shines so bright
Come out where you hide and it shines so bright
