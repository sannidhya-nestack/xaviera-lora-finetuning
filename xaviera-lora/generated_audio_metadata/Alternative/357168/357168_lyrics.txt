You called me late, bored, died and sad
What's wrong with just being friends
Well I'm so tired of hearing this sour phrase
That I'd ever do anything to change my ways
Is this real or am I just another heart to steal
The old like a dream
Like a dream, it always seems
I dream that I'm still chasing her
But I'm still chasing her
I'm still chasing her
Three o'clock late one Saturday night
They never talk, we only fight
You scream at me, you just don't understand
But how can I when you're holding this hand?
Is this real or am I just another heart to steal?
But you're like a dream
Like a dream, it always seems
I dream that I'm still chasing her
I'm still chasing her, still chasing her
You're just real, or am I just another heart to steal?
You're like a dream, like a dream it always seems
I dream that I'm still chasing on (am I just another heart to steal?)
Whoa
Like a dream, it always seems
I dream that I'm still chasing her
But I'm still chasing her
I'm still chasing her
I'm still chasing her
