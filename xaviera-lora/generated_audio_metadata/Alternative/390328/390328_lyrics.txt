A new day's arrived
I'm doing what was done
The plan is won't align
The future has begun
No magic will arise
I pour my coffee cup
Another day in an open page
In the scatterings of love
I tell myself it'll be alright
Just see there's music left to write
Well uh huh uh huh it's a promise (promise)
Uh huh, uh huh, it's a promise
Uh huh, uh huh, it's a promise
The stinging rays of sorrow
Are lighting like a swan
Wedging your tomorrow, baby
Mid-suicides and youngs
I drove them home to work
The speed wipes off this slate
And I'm not sure what it's worth
Already running late
Wait, I tell myself it'll be alright just
Say there's music left to write
Oh well, uh-huh, uh-huh, it's a promise (promise)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it's a promise
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it's a promise (promise)
Uh-huh
Alright
I tell myself it'll be alright
Just save his music left to write
Oh well, uh huh, uh huh, it's a promise
Uh huh, uh huh, it's a promise
Uh huh, uh huh, it's a promise
One more time
