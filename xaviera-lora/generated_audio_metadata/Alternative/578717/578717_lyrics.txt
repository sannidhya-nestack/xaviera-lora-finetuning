You fell, tried to undo
The wonders that would share a spell
Whistles and bells, tried to tame you
But you didn't feel wishing well
you want it so bad, want it so bad
It tears up your heart
Your pain has faded
You can't remember how
Now you're allowed
To give in to
Believing you'll have a chance
You want it so bad
Want it so bad
You don't look back
Don't squint or peek
Just lose those memories
Don't say a word
Be reckless and firm
The origin of love
Heaven may hurt
So don't say a word
The origin of love
only fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
Do you remember
How you felt like a careless kid
And how you wonder about the depths of your own abyss
You want it so bad, want it so bad, it tears up your heart
No words can define you, how the darkness equals the light
Only time can tell you
If you're able to walk the line
You want it so bad, want it so bad
You don't look back, don't squint or peek
Just lose those memories
Don't say a word, be reckless and firm
The origin of love
Heaven may hurt, so don't say a word
The origin of love
only fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
only fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread (Where angels fear to tread)
full blood shed (Where angels fear to tread)
full blood shed (Where angels fear to tread)
full blood shed (Where angels fear to treat)
full blood shed (Where angels fear to treat)
Heaven may hurt, so don't say a word
Don't say a word, be reckless and firm (the origin of love)
Heaven may hurt, so don't say a word (the origin of love)
only fools rush in (fools rush in)
Where angels fear to tread (where angels fear to tread)
only fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
