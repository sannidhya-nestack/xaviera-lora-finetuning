Pretty is the girl who waits outside your bedroom
But you don't want anything else except her help
Suddenly it's not so easy a pain to sleep through
You struggle to think of anyone but yourself
Let's not get this over with too quickly
You need a hand to hold
They send someone to monitor your breathing
And your lack of control
And maybe there'll be breakfast
In your brand new home
Lovey, you're the only one who needs the attention
Suddenly old and honest is your type
An assembly of witches waits until you call them
Summoning spells to make you feel alright
Let's not get this over with too quickly
You need a hand to hold
Send someone to monitor your breathing and your lack of control
And maybe there'll be breakfast in your brand new home
One, two, three, four
Let's not get this over with too quickly
You need a hand to hold
They said someone to monitor your breathing
And your lack of control
And maybe there'll be breakfast
In your brand new home
Ice cream in our hands, a man can stand
Watch us mess all that lipstick'round your arm
