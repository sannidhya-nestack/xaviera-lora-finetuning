I'm from LA, I love the rain
I love the way the farmers walk
I'm from New York, I love that town
I love the way the cowboys talk
And I know you know and you know me
Oh absolutely you can see me
And I'm not from here and I'm not me
I crash this party not leaving
I'm from the south, way up south
I broke my arm in North Dakota
I made it west to the rising sun
I bought the farm in East Virginia
And I know you know, you know me
Oh absolutely you can see me
And I'm not from here, and I'm not me
I crashed this party and now I've seen it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll keep flying, I'll keep fighting, I see the way you might feel
You got to draw down, I'll keep my fans on, I see the way you might feel
I'm from the country, in front of me
You can still see where I was buried
I'm from the city, wild, open city
You can see it's doors like crazy
And I know you know, you know me
I absolutely, you can see me
And I'm not from here, and I'm not me
I crushed this party and now I flee
I know you know, you know me, oh absolutely, you can see me
I'm not frontier, and I'm not mean, I crashed this party and now I'm leaving
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
I'll keep the fire, I see the way you move in me
You got your heart down, I'll keep my pants on
Cause I crave your love in me
