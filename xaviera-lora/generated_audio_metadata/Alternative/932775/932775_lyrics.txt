'Cause the moment, what did I pay for?
She's in perfume, I'm a bar stool, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Rusty fingers clutch the pavement
Weathered and broken
How's Los Angeles?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Holy moly they only want what you can't give
So you're getting pretty worried
it's just now singing (just now singing)
Yeah you're fighting battles that you know you just can't win
So you're getting pretty worried
it's just now singing (just now singing)
I'd love to leave it all behind, jump in the saddle again
Yeah, don't stare at me like y'all didn't know the ending
Sure you're alright, I'm on my way, now don't look at me
I don't need a thing, holy moly, they only want what you can't give
So you're getting pretty worried'cause it's just us again
Yeah, y'all fighting battles that you know you just can't win
So you're getting pretty worried'cause it's just us again
Yeah, the kids, well they don't see you anymore
And the girls, well they don't need you like they did before
Yeah you tumble in like some creature in hell
Yeah and I don't know the answer
All and more there ain't only one what you can't give
So you're getting pretty worried
it's just us again (it's just us again)
Yeah, you're fighting battles that you know you just can't win
So you're getting pretty worried
it's just us again
