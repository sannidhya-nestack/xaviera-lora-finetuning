I'm up, up for a good time
Always be a good time with you
You know I'm always gonna want it
I'm always gonna need it with you
You know and I know it's true
You know I'll always need you
Hey you spin me round
You make me feel so good
Oh night do it right
You make me feel so good
Hey you spin me round
You make me feel so good
Oh night do it right
You make me feel so good
It feels so good
Oh so good

Oh so good
I'm hot, hot for a good time, hot for a bad time, with you, crazy
Crazy for some action, crazy for reaction, with you
You know and I know it's true, you know I'll always need you
Hey you spin me round you make me feel so good
Oh night do it right you make me feel so good
Hey you spin me round you make me feel so good

Up, down, run around, all night, do it right, it feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good
We feel so good, so good, oh so good, so good

You know I'll always need you, round and round
You know and I know it's true, you spin me round
You know I'll always need you, upside down
You spin me round and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around
