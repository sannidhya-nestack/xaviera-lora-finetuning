Bang bang you're dead
Don't mess with me that's what I said
You tried to pump me full of lead
Well guess what you missed bang bang you're dead
You cried for your mama before you hit the floor
She don't have to worry about you no more
Mama little ain't lost his head
Go see put your devil bang bang you're dead
You're gone
Be sure to stay inside the law
Look at you now who's keeping score
Gambling and it's got a place to serve
This time I win this one you lose
Bang bang bang bang you're dead
Dead
Don't mess with me
That's what I said
You tried to poke me full of head
But guess what
Bang bang you're dead
Oh don't worry now and don't be sorry
Everything is going to be just fine
Cause I'll take care of your money
And your little honey she's going to have a real good time
Cause you ain't going back
That door's been closed
I washed my hands
The band's unplugged
Hats up and gone
And you just had your last dance
Bang bang your dad
Dad, are you meant for me?
No, Sid
And everybody got something to prove
Just step right up
Make your move
B-b-b-b-b-b-bap, bap, bap, bap, you're dead
