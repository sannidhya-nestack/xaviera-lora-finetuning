Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, ah
You are my designer drug
On the peak so high above
Yawning as my face goes
Till the rise of morning sun
You and I are worlds away
We burn like monster flames
Burn us to flames
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
You are my basil crush
All but time is not enough
Never stops and never sleeps
Case of war
All the faces I've been changing
All the losses I've been taking for you
For you
All the monsters I've been chasing
All the bones that I've been breaking
For you
For you
I never kiss and tell, you know I might as well
I can't tell what I'm seeing, know what I believe in
I'm standing on eggshells, I'm taking over worlds
Yet I am so defeated, too lost to ever leave it
I never kiss and tell, you know I might as well
I can't tell what I'm seeing, know what I believe in
I'm standing on eggshells, I'm taking over worlds
Yet I am so defeated
Goodbye my only love
Soon to die you're all that was
Saving all my words to say
When you reach out someday
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
