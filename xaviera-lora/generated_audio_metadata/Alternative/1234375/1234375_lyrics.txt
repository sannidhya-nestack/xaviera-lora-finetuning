In a jazz club's glow where the blues notes flow
Cats take the stage ready for an empty show
Tabby on the sax hitting those high notes
Whiskers go a-clitch and energy flows
Siamese slaps the bass deep and low
Tonsillo on trumpet stealing the show
Calico on keys with a sassy stride
Ginger with a clarinet swaying side to side
The beat of the drum, a pause tapping tune
Under aggressive, a jazz loving moon whirling and twirling
Their tails keep the beat as cats play jazz, oh what a treat
From dusk until dawn they groove and they glide
In the heart of the night where magic resides
So if you hear jazz with a feline theme stand
Know it's the cats with the coolest jazz band
In rhythm she flows
Siamese slaps the bass from deep and low
Tuxedo on trumpet stealing the show
Calico on keys with a sassy stride
Jinja with a clarinet swaying side to side
The beat of the drum, a pause tapping tune
Under a crescent, a jazz loving moon
Whirlin' and twirlin' their tails keep the beat
As cats play jazz, oh what a treat
From dusk until dawn they groove and they glide
In the heart of the night where magic resides
So if you hear jazz with a feline theme stand
Know it's the cats with the coolest jazz band
