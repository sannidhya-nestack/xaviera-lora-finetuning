The fear is south of the line, far from my creek
And who am I stuck in the reeds?
But it's all over now
I'm cancelling out
Still trying now
Don't fail me now
Cruel circles around
The cold winds are drifting
Sun carries down the mines
Remember St. Agnes
The past present on the mind
I'm down for the last time
Down on my last dime
Don't fail me now
I'm down for the last time
Down on my last dime
Don't fail me now
'Cause hope finds you here in the highlight of it all
New light I'm seeing where everything goes new
Life I'm breathing, I walk along St. Agnes
Now I'll live you
Jesus, I can't see you anymore
