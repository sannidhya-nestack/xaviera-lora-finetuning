My body's Tuesday, my mind is Friday
Just got to work and I'm craving my break
And I've never really been in one place
They say it's gonna catch up one day
I planned my funeral at twenty seven
Taking care of things after when I'm dead
And I'm always living in my head
Planning all of my regrets
My mom says to eat more veggies
Dad says it's just your twenties
My friends say it all works out but they're all sleeping on my couch
My head keeps spinning round and round
I'm just gonna inhale exhale
I'm just gonna inhale exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
Last week I tried meditation to take a break from my expectations
And honestly I hated it
My mind gets louder in the quiet
My mom says to eat more veggies
Dad says it's just your twenties
My friends say it all works out
But they're all sleeping on my couch
My head keeps spinning round and round
Can someone turn this music down
I'm just gonna inhale exhale
I'm just gonna inhale exhale
I'm just gonna inhale exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I think that I'm unwell
Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da
My mom says to eat more veggies
Dad says it's just your twenties
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I'm just gonna inhale, exhale
I think that I'm unwell
