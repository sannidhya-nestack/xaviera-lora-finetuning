You got a certain attraction
Or is it all in your head?
You lose your cash in casinos
And you will pay for the most of it
Oh no, I try to let you know
You got it bad now baby
You gotta pay for the suits you know
Well you're a part time lover
And you'll be hit by the worst of it
Oh no, I try to let you know
But there's always something else
When you know you're haunted
It's a shame
Then no one's asking, you try to give it up
Oh, you must've been joking if you thought this was an easy way out
Because it's far too much of a risk to watch your movie with the lights on
We've been there baby, you're going round in a circle
And you shouldn't have had that drink before you left bound me
There must be someone else out to tie your noose
Cause you're going nowhere with that bad attitude
Got the gun, got the trigger, got the guts to fire it's so easy
We know you're horny
It's a shame that no one's asking
We know you're high
It's a shame that no one's watching
When you know you're on it (Got the gun, got the trigger, got the gas)
It's a shame that no one's asking, yeah
When you know you're high (Got the gun, got the trigger, got the gas)
It's a shame for you that no one's watching
Oh baby, cut it out
The baby's gonna bite me with its eyes
