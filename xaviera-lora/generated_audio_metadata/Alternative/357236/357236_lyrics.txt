Get to the point
Cut to the chase
I know the world
Is filled up with grace
I'm going home
I'm going there
I wrote my will
I climbed the stairs
I know your eyes can't bear to see
And your ears can't bear to hear
Long goodbye
Nevertheless we're in this mess
I still believe
You had to leave
You're not a friend
You're not a foe
My mama said
I oughta know, oh, know
I know your eyes can't bear to see
And your ears can't bear to hear
Long goodbye, this is a long goodbye
Dreams were getting big and our love was getting strong
Show you something better but you, you got to hold on
You got to hold on, you got to hold on
Dreams were getting big and our love was getting strong
Show you something better but you, you got to hold on
You got to hold on, you got to hold on
Step out of line, step on the grass, my mama said
This love will surpass one of these days
You're gonna feel a little sting
Yeah you're gonna kneel
I know your eyes can't bear to see
And your ears can't bear to hear
Long goodbye, this is your long goodbye
Dreams were getting big and our love was getting strong
I'll show you something better but you, you got to hold on
You got to hold on, you got to hold on
Dreams were getting big and our love was getting strong
I'll show you something better but you, you got to hold on
You got to hold on
You got to hold on
(Ah)
