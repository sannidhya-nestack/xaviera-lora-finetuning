How long have I been asleep?
Closed my eyes and fell in deep
Where have all the people gone
What has happened to my soul
I've been waiting
We're floating somewhere in the night
We're praying, we're wishing
Hoping I'd somehow see the light and die
I feel like a kite
Floating weightless
And I've flown out of sight
But let go
Of the stray hoe, yeah
How much longer must I wait
Before I see the pearly gates
Does God love me? Does she care?
Heaven's out there but who knows where
I've been waiting
I'm floating somewhere in the night
I'm praying, I'm wishing, I'm hoping
I'd somehow see the light
And I feel like a kite
Floating weightless
And I've flown out of sight
And let go
Lift the string, hold on
And I feel like I could kite
Float down, wait, let her
And I've flown out of sight
Let go of the strangle, yeah
(He's all over me)
