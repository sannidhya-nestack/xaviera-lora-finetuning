She's an illusion
Fear
She
She's
She's an illusion
Oh she's
She's an illusion
I can't believe I'm really seeing beauty so divine
Is this summer heat I'm feeling playing with my mind?
Are you imagination or my soul's salvation?
I feel this passion burning me on fire
See, she, she's, she's an illusion
Once in her
In my world
She's, she's an illusion
Oh she's, she's an illusion
I don't even know you still
It feels just like I do
Should I trust my heart and hope that love will guide me through?
Are you a holy vision?
Or just my intuition?
That tells me things are gonna be alright?
Be here, she's, she's, she's an illusion
Wanting her (I want her)
In my world (I need her)
She's, she's an illusion
Oh she's, she's an illusion
Are you imagination?
Or my soul's salvation?
I feel this passion burning me on fire
Feel she
She's, she's an illusion
Wanting her in my world
She's, she's an illusion (she's an illusion)
Feel, I feel it
She, I need it
She's, she's an illusion (she's an illusion)
Wanting her (I want her)
In my world (I need her)
She's, she's an illusion
