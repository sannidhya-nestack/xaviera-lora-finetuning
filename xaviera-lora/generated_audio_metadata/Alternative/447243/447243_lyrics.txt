They're taking names and kicking butt and coming to your town
Hillbillies on speed
They'll kick it out and tear it up, there ain't no clowning round
Somebody's gonna bleed
Up in moonshine madness, hell-raising new streets
High altitude madness from the hillbilly cats on speed
They're tearing down the highway and their lives are on fire
Speed in their veins, their heads in their tires
Hellcats from hell and they don't smell too well
They're thieves, they're crooks, they're scoundrels, they're liars
Digging ancient kicking butt and coming to your town
Your Billy's on speed
They're kicking out and tearing up, there ain't no clowning around
Somebody's gonna bleed
They'll be moonshine madness and hell raising in the streets
I have the truth that is from the hillbilly cats on speed
Speed
They're bustin' heads, they're shootin' lead, they're greasin' their sleeves
Cussin' and a-fussin' and they don't hear no please
Cruisin' for a bruisin' on their Hellcat and spree
They're pigs, they're scum, they're lynches, they're fleas
They're takin' names and kickin' butt and comin' to your town
You billies on speed
They're kickin' out and turnin' up, there ain't no clownin'round
Somebody's gonna bleed
There'll be moonshine madness and hell raisin' in the streets
High altitude baggage from the hill, Billy Cats on speed
The hill, Billy Cats on speed
The hill, Billy Cats on speed
The hill, Billy Cats on speed
