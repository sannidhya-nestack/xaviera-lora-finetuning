Johnny ran away with the money
He stashed it in his trunk
It wasn't long before the cops caught up
Now Johnny's out of luck
Johnny's got away with the words
His stories they're like clay
He can bend the every situation
But eventually he'll pay
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
So disconnect the phone and disconnect your life
You can hide away in New York City but don't you go out at night
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
You're going down, you're going down
I'll take you out the next time around
