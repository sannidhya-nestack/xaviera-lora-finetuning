I left the city lights behind
On my way to find my destiny
I figured it out
But I can't stop
My love, my love
I sit a while and watch the stars
Could have sworn that I saw Mars
Shining bright but I can't stop my love, my love
I try to blank it out
Erase this whole self doubt
It's true
I'm running to survive
To cleanse my soul
My eyes are red and crazed
Gotta make these forty days
Night after night I fight with the demons
Taking control of all of my feelings in my space
I long for your embrace
The days are so cold without you to hold me
I feel exposed to break my heart again
Ease away the pain
Ooh
I feel so lost without your love
All alone I need you here with me
Save me now but I can't stop
My love, my love
I try to blank it out
Erase this whole self doubt
It's you
I'm running to survive
To cleanse my soul
My eyes are red and crazed
Gotta make these 40 days
Night after night
I fight with the demons
Taking control of all of my feelings
In my space
I long for your embrace
The days are so cold without you to hold me
I feel exposed to break my heart again
Ease away the pain
Night after night I fight with the demons
Taking control of all of my feelings in my space
I long for your embrace
The days are so cold without you to hold me
I feel exposed to break my heart again
Ease away the pain
My love, my love, my love, my love
