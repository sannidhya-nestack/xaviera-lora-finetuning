As the night passes by
I hope you can
ive me
For things I didn't do
I hear them talk about their faith
I can't wait to see the fear
Swallow up their faces
And they think that it's the truth
If it is then why don't I see it too?
Hear them pray unto their God
About something I don't understand
Yet I evolve and spin our way
Stuck in buildings that I can't escape
As I make my way to the door or the floor
Whatever one comes first
Let them know that we won't obey
And they will all fall into their places
And they think that it's the truth
If it is then why don't I see it too
You give, you give, you give
But still it's not enough
To have some comfort in your lives
You give, you give, you give
Oh you give your life
You're hoping for a miracle tonight
And let them know how you feel
To get turned away
From everything
You ever wanted
And I don't see the truth
That you see
And I won't
Everyone a ballin'
But they think it's a good day
When they don't all fall into the ground
Let them know that we won't obey
And they will all fall into their places
And they think that it's the truth
If it is then why don't I see it too?
