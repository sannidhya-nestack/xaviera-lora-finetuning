Take your shoes off
And lose your clothes
Turn the world off
And lose control
Can you stop my mind
Make me blind
We're getting nowhere
I need to get somewhere
Is this all?
But I want more
And I don't think I can fake it
Some days make you well
You're wrong but you stand still and nothing seems to fit
And live is your heart beating
You keep moving on, we're losing it
The illusion, the illusion
Is this all, what I want more
And I don't think I can fake it
Is this all, what I want more?
And I don't think I can fake it
Is this all
What I want more
And I don't think I can fake it
Is this all
When I want more
But I don't think I can make it, oh
(howling)
