I open my window and see
A snow-globe fantasy
Almost mystical, ooh
I close my eyes and I feel summer memories
Take me back to the warmest days
Your music's playing in the sun
Everyone can hear, oh, sequera
Take me with you
Wherever you are there is sun
There is green and blue
Where my ears find you
Wherever you are there is sun
Wherever you are there is sun
Snowfall kisses my cheek
I'm inside its mystique
Like a fairy tale
Warm by the fire and then
I feel your song from within
Take me back to the warmest day
Your music's playing in the sun
Everyone can hear old cicadas
Take me with you
Wherever you are there is sun
There are flowers too
Where my heart finds you
Wherever you are there is sun (wherever you are there is sun) (wherever you are there is sun) (wherever you are there is sun) (wherever you are there is sun)
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Cicada, won't you take me up high in the sky?
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la (Cicada, please take me up high in the sky, oh)
Cicada, take me with you
Wherever you are there is sun
There is green and blue
Where my ears find you
Wherever you are there is sun
Cicada, please take me with you
Wherever you are there is sun
There are flowers too
Where my heart finds you
Wherever you are there is sun (sun)
Wherever you are there is sun (sun)
Wherever you are there is sun (sun)
Wherever you are there is sun (sun)
Take me in your arms like a scarlet cicada
Cicada, cicada, cicada, cicada
