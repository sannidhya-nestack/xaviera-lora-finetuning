I dream of becoming (and I dream) in this world (in this world)
I dream of becoming (I dream) one (one)
I dream
I'll become the only one in these worlds I dream
I'll become the only one
I'll become the only one in these worlds I dream
Sweet music leaves and arrows fade through the starlit night
I've been watching shadows dance on the walls
The leaves they fade as the new sun calls
Germs buried in the breeze that smell of rainbows deep to me
I dream of becoming a dream in this world
I dream of becoming a dream
Becoming a dream, becoming a dream
Becoming a dream, becoming a dream
When I dream
Dream of becoming one with you
A dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one with you
A dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one with you
A dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one with you
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
Dream of becoming one
