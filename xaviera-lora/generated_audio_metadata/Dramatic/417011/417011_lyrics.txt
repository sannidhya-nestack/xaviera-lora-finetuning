You got my attention like a tidal wave
But I don't even wanna run away
You're breaking up the signal in my atmosphere
'Cause it's hard (and I can't afford you to feel my heart)
you're so fine
Stay a little longer boy, I got things to show you (yeah)
Stay a little longer boy, oh oh oh
Stay a little longer boy, I got plans to know you (yeah)
Stay a little longer boy
O-O-O-M-O-V-E
Now you got me thinking'bout some kind of strategy
How can I get that close to me?
And since I saw your face, all I can say is
Oh, baby, baby, yeah
Stay a little longer, boy
Stay a little longer, boy
Stay a little longer, boy
Stay a little longer, boy
Stay a little longer, boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
I got things to show you
Stay a little longer boy
Oh, stay a little longer boy
I got plans to know you
Stay a little longer boy
Oh, stay a little longer boy
L-O-V-E
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Let me break it down now
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy
Stay a little longer boy, oh oh oh
Stay a little longer boy, stay a little longer boy, oh oh oh
Stay a little longer boy, stay a little longer boy
