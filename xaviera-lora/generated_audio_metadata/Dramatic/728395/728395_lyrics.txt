When your dreams seem a heartbreak away
Don't know how you'll last through the day
You'd be better off to smile than cry
When life has you cancel your plans
Destiny seems out of your hands
You'd be better off to smile than cry
We all have days that feel like
It's time to throw in the towel
But bad times are the ones that make
The good seem so worthwhile
So why don't you smile?
The next time you get caught feeling blue
Don't feel bad, others feel it too
And you'd be
You'd be better off to smile
You'd be better off to smile
You'd be better off to smile than cry, ooh
Don't cry
