What do we owe each other in the game of love?
What do we owe ourselves?
And what choice do we have?
So many people in bed with us
Like crashing dolls
One mother inside the other
Or action shots on low speed film
Endless shadows seeming to move as one
How?
Do we know each other in the game of love?
How do we know ourselves and what right do we have?
So many people alone like us, we're broken dolls
No lover within the other
Like empty hearts beneath the veil
Endless shadows never to be one
What do we owe each other in the game of love?
What do we owe ourselves?
Endless shadows seeming to move as one
