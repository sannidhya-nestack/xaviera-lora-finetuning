Justice, justice
Quick, get your mom
The windows are all broken
And the rains have begun
Liberty, liberty
Go run and ring the bell
The rain is getting in
Abraham, Abraham, help me to restore
Please hammer in this nail while I hold up this board
Judas, Judas, oh please do look away
Don't tell your father what you have seen this day
Rita, my child, what's happened to you?
Your clothes are all torn and your face is black and blue
You're covered in oil and lost your free will
Some say you've taken a suicide pill
As hard as I try I just can't see
Oh please my child
Say it's not true
Lord my lord
I know you'll be kind
But what of all the women
And the kids left behind
We mustn't et
What of the immigrant poor
For Lucifer is here, oh, wanting so much more
Princess of darkness, I'm begging you please
Lay off of these people, I'm down on my knees
In freedom, my child, what's happened to you?
Clothes are all torn and your face is black and blue
You're covered in oil and lost your free will
Some say you've taken a suicide pill
As hard as I try, I just can't see you
Oh please my child, say it's not true
