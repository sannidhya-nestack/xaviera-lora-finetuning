Lotus Sacra
Sacred Lotus
Velvet colours, diminishing light
Never ending, never minding, ever waiting
Always, somewhere, everywhere
Everywhere
Sacred lotus
Filled underneath, awaiting rain
Remaining, reminding, encountering
Blossoming in deep silence
Sacred lotus
Blossoming in deep silence
My secret lotus
Unstaken, cool yet bright
Far away and away forever
Never gone but never gone
Never gone but never gone
Sacred lotus, my sacred lotus
Lotus I will never be gone
