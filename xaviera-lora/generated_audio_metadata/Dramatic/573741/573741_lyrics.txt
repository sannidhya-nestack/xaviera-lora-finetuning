A tapestry woven in gold
A life that I already know
The chatter will cease
When they take their seats
The lights of the stage all aglow
A melody sweeping the floor
The flattery raised to a door
The band starts to play
It all goes away
The moment you walk through the door
'Til now I never knew
Why violins sing on butterfly wings
It's all becoming true
Now that I'm in love with you
The songs and the stories of old
Where whispers are never untold
Our lives are all paved with promises made
And wishes we wished long ago
Till now I never knew
Why daffodils swoon there over the moon
The world is all I knew
My heart's alive, I've realized
Now that I'm in love with you
