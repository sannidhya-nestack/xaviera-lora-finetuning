Of the winter winding
I long for the woman's sigh
I long for the touch and sigh
Summer feels the sweat of beauty
Trembling comes with all you knew
In December you will see me
Smiling dim, but always grieving
In the warming of a cycle deadly
Of the summer's whispers onto sweet December
Melancholy breathing winter faded leaves
So bitter crystals to December
I seek for the spring of life
I leave all the bitter shines
In the fall within November
Trembling with the sadness blows
In December you will see me
Smiling dim but always grieving
In the warming of a cycle deadly
Of the summer's whispers onto sweet despair
Melancholy breathing winters faded leaves so bitter crystals to December
(Humming)
