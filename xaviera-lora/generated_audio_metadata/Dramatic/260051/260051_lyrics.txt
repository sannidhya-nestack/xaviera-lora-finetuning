Honor, riches, marriage, blessing
Long continuance and increasing
Holy joys bestill upon you
Judah sings her blessings on you
Holy joys bestill upon you
Judas sings her blessings on you
Earth's increase and poison plenty
Barns and garners never empty
Scarcity and one shall shun you
Saddest blessings so is on you
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest
Oh, in worries beyond known to you
I release a blessing on you
Every day the sun shall shine on you
Heaven bless the love that binds you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
