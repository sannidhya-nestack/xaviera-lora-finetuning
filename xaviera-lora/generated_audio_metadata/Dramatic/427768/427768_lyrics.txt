Crucifixus, crucifixus, atima cum misurum
Cups in cup, we go to school
Cups in these cups, us, us, us, us
I am the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
Spare the moon, show us how
