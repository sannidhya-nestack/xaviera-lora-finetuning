Almond trees in the hill, we saw them today
Almond trees in a hill, we saw them today
The Alfred Bonnet, do you want to know?
But almond trees, almond roots
Oh, you refer to olive roots
Those olive trees have larger roots
I do not know about almond trees
Those olive trees have larger roots
I do not know about almond trees
Demis waters, and how can you cease to be troubled
About the rest of the winter?
To be troubled about the rest of the summer
And the start of the winter?
Every night the snow falls
Yes, and so do the asphodels
There is no use in trying to accustom yourself to their beauty
Dear sir, I heard the roja ringing
We all did good night, Isabella Furness
Dear sir, I heard the roja ringing
We all did good night, Isabella Furness
I like their names
It is easy to name a street like that it is
With a view of trees and a hill
We were there and the almond flowers turned into almond leaves
Do you mean that a great many people were troubled?
Not a great many people
Some are happy and lucky and some are the others
We all have our wishes
Yadadadadadada yadadadadada
Almond trees in a hill
We saw them today
