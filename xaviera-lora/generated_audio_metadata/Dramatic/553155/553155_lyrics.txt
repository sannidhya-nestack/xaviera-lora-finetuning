Or a midsummer night's dream
A madness or maybe a fever
All of us caught in between our hopes and desires
Until the time we awake
Wearing the mask of enchantment
Vapor and steam
All amidst a moonlit stream
All of the love that we make
And all of the hearts we are breaking
Fade into memory
When we awaken
On a midsummer night's dream
Love might arrive without warning
Soft as a whispered prayer
Between midnight and morning
Changing the shape of our lives
Changing the things we desire
It is as it seems, on a midsummer night's dream
All of the love that we make
And all of the hearts we are breaking
Fade into memory
When we awaken
On amidst a night's dream
On amidst a night's dream
On amidst a night's dream
