Time to let a little light in
Time that I came out of hiding
Time for me to pick a side and take a stand
So very blind can be the eyes of man
Until one day the sun breaks through
The clouds have gone born in this place but
It's not the place where I belong
How did things here go so wrong?
Born in this place but it's not where I belong
Time for me to stop my fighting
In a war I might have died in
Time to swallow all my pride tear down this wall
Wait for the other shoe to fall
No surprise that when it does
The crowd has gone
Born in this place but
It's not the place where I belong
Sometimes I just can't go on
Born in this place but
It's not where I belong
The truth gets lost in all the noise
It's always hard to make the choice
Between destruction
And devotion, my mind is clouded by emotion
Guess I can't lose what I ain't got
Pretending to be something that I'm not
Born in this place but it's not the place where I belong
How did things here go so wrong?
Born in this place but it's not the place where I belong
Sometimes I just can't go on
Born in this place but
It's not where I belong
