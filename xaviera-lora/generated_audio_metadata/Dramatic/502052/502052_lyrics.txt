On this night I dream
We accompany our child
To the ritual bath
Built deep into the ground
Below the vision of
Those involved in daily life
So none unschooled in Congress
Can see the levers in their profound
Rights examined in their bodies
Learning nakedness
Immersion
I awake to the stroke of a hand
Move my body flush to my old man
I awake to the stroke of a hand
Move my body flush to my old man
On this night I dream
We accompany our child
To the ritual bath
Built deep into the ground
Below the vision of
Those involved in daily life
So none unschooled in Congress
Can see the lovers in their profound
Rights examining their bodies
Learning nakedness
I awake to the stroke of a hand
Move my body, flesh to my old man
I awake to the stroke of a hand
Move my body, flesh to my old man
