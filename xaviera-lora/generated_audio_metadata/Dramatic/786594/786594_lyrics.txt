Sometimes the night sky glitters like a new world
Each star's a dream you haven't seen yet
And so we fall for one that calms us
That's when my life told me I should try to lie
I wanted magic wrapped in a kiss
It seemed so tragic what I was missing
It's strange how we go on believing
We'll find romance, the perfect dance, a second chance
Had what's been right there waiting for us
And love songs always play inside us
Hoping we'll begin the search within
