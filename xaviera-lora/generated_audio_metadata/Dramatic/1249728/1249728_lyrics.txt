Did you ever have a week for a girl who could expire?
Ten thousand year bitch, you've held a hot desire
Doesn't even get to suprise a girl who fits the bill
I think she took the little red pill, she's a sight to see
And this money, a smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She struts in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion's so fine, you have to get in there and dream, see the worth cost
All's a pretty penny, come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little mom and Phil's being rich, one tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
All this money, you want fancy sweet honey
It's the thing that you adore, miss money
Now you got a little, would you like a little more?
Miss money, sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you got my text
Flexible finessing, I can see that you've been missing
Some things I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got all of that, it's quite the little thing
Generous, she is very, very, very keen
Buying up a love, it's something that you can't ever seem to get enough
On the swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crushing it very hard, in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money, you're a fantasy
I think about ya every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person
To a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend
Maybe you're a wife
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes, she's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweetifiers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses for the Dow Jones market, a monthly investment
Not selling just to pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh what a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy
Eyes love, but it's never ever tiny
With a trickle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy, funner made by flying
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's any picture with a golden touch
Cost of love it seems too much this money
Oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
I'll say school failure, torn apart
But oh, Ms. Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Oh, Ms. Money, you're a fantasy
I think about ya every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person
To a person in this money
So bow out the bowl, make your assets be liquid
