Freedom, freedom
It was September 11th, 2001
That day God shed some tears
As he looked down at us
Freedom, freedom
Oh how did our country gain all of its trust
There's some people it seems that hates all of us
They have martyrs and leaders that make it this way
But our heroes stood up to them on that faithful day
It was September 11, 2001
That day God shed some tears as he looked down at us
Freedom, freedom
Those people made history on one single day
They thought they would break our spirit but our flag is still waves
As they danced in their streets they showed us their ways
They just brought us all together made us stronger that day
It was September 11th, 2001
That day God shed some tears
As he looked down at us
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom, freedom
