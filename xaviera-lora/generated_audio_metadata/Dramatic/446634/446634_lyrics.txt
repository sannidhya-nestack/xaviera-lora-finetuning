She told you that you're the best thing that ever happened to her
It's no question that you're the best thing that ever happened to her
The best thing that happened to her
Don't let it go, don't let it slide
you never know if you never tried
Have no regrets, don't play it safe
you never know
It could be fate, what would you say if she told you
That you're the best thing that ever happened to her
It's no question that you're the best thing that ever happened to her
The best thing that happened to her
What would you say if she told you
That you're the best thing that ever happened
Two words, no question
That you're the best thing that ever
What would you say if she told you
You're the best thing that ever happened to her
No question, you're the best thing that ever happened to her
The best thing that happened to her
The best thing that happened to her
The best thing that happened to her
You're the best thing that happened to her
