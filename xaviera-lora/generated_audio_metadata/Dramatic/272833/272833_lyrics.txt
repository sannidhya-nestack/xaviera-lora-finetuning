I think he's funny, quoting Bugs Bunny
I never get my fill of the rabbit of Seville
He laughs at my pun, but is he the one?
I could be absolutely, positively certain
This is love, how serendipitous
That he digs sci-fi flicks
With outdated film tricks
That Star Wars can't replace
Plan 9 from outer space
I seem to agree with his POV
I could be absolutely positively certain
This is love
We had so much in common meeting at the drugstore sale on Echinacea
To think perchance a little cold might lead to more like having to hold
Or so I'm told that he places LPs never MP3s
I think vinyl is divine, is this coincidence a sign?
It's much too soon to celebrate, it's likely just another date
We'll see if this hypothesis concludes
That I'm absolutely positively certain
This is love
Disco is kitschy
We groove to Lionel Richie
We hustle with the flare of a Rogers and a stare
We're dancing, how great
We can both count to eight
I should be absolutely positively certain
This is love
It's so fortuitous that he's high on prana
Not marijuana
He's into yoga too
Downward dog he likes to do
We talk like old friends
And I'm glad that he bends
I'm almost absolutely positively certain
This is love
I'll bet that he's had me so, although
It wouldn't be so strange or accidental
The things he likes are what I like
I minored and he majored in psych
A lucky strike, he howls at the far side
The cow as the June bride
That Larson is a hoot
There is nothing to refute
I feel a tingle in my toes
Is this it, do you suppose?
There will be that magic when we kiss
I'm absolutely positively certain
This is love
