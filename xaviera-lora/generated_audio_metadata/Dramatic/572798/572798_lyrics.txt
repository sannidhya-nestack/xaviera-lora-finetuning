Did you just call my name
Whispering in my ear
The way you do when you are near
I'm just missing you my dear
And your kiss
So many different roads
So many ways to choose
So many things to be afraid to lose
I only sang these blues for your kiss
Fragrant, warm and sweet
The memory makes my heart skip a beat
If you remember me like I remember you
If you remember things that we used to do
Then you know why I'm true to your kiss
Fragrant, warm and sweet
The memory makes my heart skip a beat
If you remember me
Like I remember you
If you remember things
That we used to do
Then you know why I'm true
To your kiss
