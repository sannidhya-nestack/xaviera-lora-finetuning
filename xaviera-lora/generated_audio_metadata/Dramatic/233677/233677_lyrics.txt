Your smile
Your smile
You smile, you smile, you smile, you smile, you smile, you smile
The world is a mirror
What's looking at you
If you smile in front of it
It will smile right back to you
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
So sing in love and harmony and you'll see what a wonderful sound
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
I see women and men both young and old
Trying to make it work
It's the hope and the dreams of a better day
The hopes of a better world
Like the sun in the heaven
We shine with a smile in our everyday
We gotta wake up with a smile in our face
And optimismus will rule your day
Yeah yeah
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
Your smile is infectious
It waltzes around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
Your smile is infectious
It walks around and around and around
So infectious
It passes on and on
Your smile is infectious
(Run it on, run it on, run it on, run it on)
So infectious (run it on, run it on, run it on),
Your smile is infectious
(Run it on, run it on, run it on, run it on)
So infectious (run it on, run it on, run it on),
It passes on and on
