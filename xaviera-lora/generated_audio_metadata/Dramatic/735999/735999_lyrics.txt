Bye bye.
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
See, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose
Sing, sing, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues, blues
Go on, go on, blues, sing, blues, go on, go on, blues
Go on, blues, go on, blues, blues, blues
Go on, blues, blues, blues, blues
