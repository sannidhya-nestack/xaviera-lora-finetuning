Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, You be Radha
To the moon
You'll be right down here, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
I don't know what to say to you, but I love you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You'll be right there
Don't look
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Who'll be there?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Who'll be there?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh

(Be with me)
(Meow, meow, meow)
(Meow, meow, meow)
