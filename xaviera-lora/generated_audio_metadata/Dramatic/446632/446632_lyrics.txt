I'll wait until you're sober, I'll wait to see your face
Now won't you please come closer, listen to what I say
I'll be there when you're lonely
I'll be there when you're afraid
I'll be there when the world is ending
I'm just a phone call away
I'll be there when your heart is broken
I'll be there on your darkest days
So never et that I'm right here
I'm just a phone call away
I'll wait until you're sober
I'll wait to see your face
Now won't you please come closer
Listen to what I say
I'll be there when life's not so fair
I'll be there when it rains
I'll be there when there's no one to laugh with
I'll be there when amends are made
I'll be there when the sky's clear
I'll be there every beautiful day
So never et that I'm right here
I'm just a phone call away
I'm just a phone call away
I'm just a phone call away
I'm just a phone call away
I'm just a phone call away
