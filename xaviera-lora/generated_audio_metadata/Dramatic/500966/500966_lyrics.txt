Then it comes back
And the game becomes
Complex, almost
Almost impossible
Obsessions are easy, loving someone who doesn't look back
So pure, hitting ball after falling to an empty court
You don't expect to return, no, no, no
Yamparara yamparara yamparara yari yari ya
Yamparara yamparara yamparara yari yari ya
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Obsessions are easy, loving someone who doesn't love back
So pure, hitting ball after ball into an empty court
You don't expect to return, no, no, no
Yumpa-da-da, yumpa-da-da, yumpa-da, da, da, da, da, da, ya, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yumpa-da-da, yumpa-dada, yumpa-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, ya
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Moving, changing dangerous
Moving, changing, dangerous
Then it comes back
And the game becomes
Complex, almost
Almost impossible
And it comes back and the game becomes
Complex, almost, almost impossible
