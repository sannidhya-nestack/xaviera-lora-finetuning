Oh my, can you remember
The first night we shared
Stars gazed as we blazed
Passing time without a care
Somehow life can arrange things
And the darkness disappears
And the fears I've had have cleared
clearly I've found someone here
Chemistry's geometry
Spends its days crossing lines
And that was fine till one fine time
Imagine when our lifetime is through
I guess this feel I got will feel like it's not real as I have you
