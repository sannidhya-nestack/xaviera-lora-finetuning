I store all sweet memories
Like fireflies in a jar
Our bloodline lights the northern sky
You are the shining star
I stand inside your room
Where once you lived with me
And should I stand so still enough
The love comes back to me
Know this, my good son
I'm so proud of who you are
Whether righteous, rebellious
You are, you are the shining star
Take this love I have known
Now make it your own
It has served me well
Let it lead you home
A father's blessings to thee
As you journey an endless sea
Wear it proudly like armor
Your name came from me
Now make it your own
It has served me well
Let it lead you home
No matter where you roam
Oh, shall the light of our memories
Help you seek the way back home
