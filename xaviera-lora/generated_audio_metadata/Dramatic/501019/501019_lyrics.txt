They always do it, those Jewish women
Promise you everything and cut off your head
Always do it, those Jewish women
Cut off your head and then celebrate
Wine and cheese and all the teasing
And you can't be sure
Those Jewish widows know how to please
Know how to please
We always do it
We Jewish women
Promise you everything and cut off your head
Always at it
We Jewish women cut off your head and then celebrate
Wine and cheese, and all that is in, and you can't be sure
Those Jewish widows, know how to please, know how to please
Wine and cheese and all that is there
And you can be sure
Those Jewish widows know how to please
Know how to please
And complain about the mess
The dirty Assyrian head
Makes rolling across the clean, clean floor
