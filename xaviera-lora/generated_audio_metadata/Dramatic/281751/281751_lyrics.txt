Some say it's in the gentle touch of knowing hands
Or in the smile of friendly faces that understand
Or in the pleasant presence of a giving heart
But to truly know a soul in need it has to start in the eyes
It's in the eyes that see the light that shines within
It's where the caring and the giving must begin in the eyes
On the road to wellness or toward the light
The reflection from another's heart can make things bright
By a simple act of kindness from folks who feel
Just by listening or consoling with words that heal
But it's in the eyes of the special ones whose remedy for pain
Is prescribing love for loneliness
To make them whole again
It's in the eyes
They're a shoulder to cry on
On a silent garden wall
A smile or a helping hand
A confidential talk
They'll read a story, bring a blanket
Hold a hand or be a friend
It never ends
It never ends
Searching their own hearts to find a better way
So others can stand tall and greet a brighter day
Seeing and just looking are two different things
The ones with loving insight can give others wings
But it's in the eyes
The eyes that have the gift to look beyond
To seek the hidden glimmer of an ageless bond
It's in the eyes
It's in the eyes that see the light that shines within
It's where the caring and the giving must begin
In the eyes
They can read the lives of others
In their eyes
In their eyes
In their eyes
