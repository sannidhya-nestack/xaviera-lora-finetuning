Stealing everything I love
With every hand
With every hand
With every hand
Have
Always far away
Always out of reach
Always far away
Imagine the world
Through my eyes
Beauty and man
I didn't understand
Stealing everything I love
Turn around
You were always far away (always out of reach, always far away)
Tonight we die alone
Tonight we die alone
Turn around, spin around
Follow me, never question
We know why someone
Because we're out of time soon
Tonight we die alone
With our heads dangling sore
Turn around, spin around
Follow me and never question
We know why some love
Has to move
With blind eyes and polished tongue
Stealing everything I love
With every hand, with every hand, with every hand, ah
So long, we're tired and old
So long, we're tired and old
So long, we're tired and old
So long, we're tired and old
So long, we're tired and old
So long, we're tired and old
She loves, she loves, she loves, she loves, she loves me too, she loves, she loves me too
