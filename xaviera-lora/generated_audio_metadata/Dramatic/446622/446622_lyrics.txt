This song is about a journey, a fateful journey
To a place only a few have gone before
Across rivers, over mountains, valleys, oceans
Through the universe we will stretch the seams
The very fabric of time itself
To find the stars in her eyes
I sit and wonder why
Those stars in the sky
Every single one
A story it arrives
It all started here
A long time ago
The story started here
A long, long time ago
Let's go for a ride
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-a-ah-ah
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah
I sit and wonder why those stars in the sky
Every single one, a story in our eyes
It all started here, a long time ago
The story started here, a long long, a long long time ago
