Life
Life
Living pictures of the world
Reflecting what we are
Behind our illusions
Giving up old habits
Tumbling through different moves
Views keep on changing
Life is a struggle
We have to take
Life is a dream we have to live
Life is a challenge put on a smile
Life is a duty for us to complete
Life
Moving in space and time
Able to read the signs
Appearing on our way
Going through what comes along
Turning left and turning right
Asking for directions
Life is a struggle
We have to take
Life is a dream
We have to live
Life is a challenge
Put on a smile
Life is a duty for us to complete
In the course of the years
We might swim against the stream
Arranging our confusions
Life is a struggle we have to take
Life is a dream we have to live
Life is a challenge
Put on a smile
Life is a duty
For us to complete
Life is a struggle
Life is a dream
Life is a challenge
Life is a duty for us to complete
