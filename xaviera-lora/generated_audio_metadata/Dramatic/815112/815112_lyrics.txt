Living my life in a song, singing the words all wrong
Still living my life in a song
You are the words and the rhyme
You keep me in time
You're the reason for my song
You are my blanket of love
You keep me warm
When you lay my body down
Overwhelms my soul
I am yours to hold
Every breath of mine is yours
Oh, the music that we play
Perfect melody that never fades
Living my life in a song
Singing the words all wrong
Living, living my life in a song
Living my life in a song
Singing the words all wrong
You're the reason for my song
