Silence slips into my world
And it follows into my dreams
Moonbeams
Flicker across my room
And in the twilight
Your thoughts will be broken
And when the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
When the sun goes down
A shadow is cast on this town
And when the sun goes down
The night breaks free
When the sun
When the sun, the sun goes down
