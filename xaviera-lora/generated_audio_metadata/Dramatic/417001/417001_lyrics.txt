Legendary love, my heart's been stolen
All my skies are grey since you've been gone
Things that used to make me smile make me cry instead
Tears won't stop falling, I'm in over my head
Legendary love, there are no others
There is only one, just one life
Not looking for the prince, I've got investments in fine art
Oh, legendary love, return my heart
Memories of sunny days, flowering trees
I miss you badly, are you missing me?
Legendary love, your smile, it was golden
You have touched my soul
But I'm so blue
I hope you know
I love you so
Why are we apart?
Oh, legendary love
Return my legendary love
You've got to
Legendary love
Return my heart
Return my heart
On my heart
