Feels like I'm floating as the warmest hands wonder over me
Daylight fades, the sun is going down, it melts into the sea
I don't know why you try so hard, I'm simply yours
Baby, I won't go
I love you boy, I'm simply yours
My finger traces the sweetest lips
I kiss you while you sleep
And I wonder if you understand just what you've given me
I don't know why you try so hard, I'm simply yours
Baby, I won't go
'Cause I love you, boy, I'm simply yours
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ooh
I'm simply yours
Ba-da-da, ba-ba-da-da, ooh
I'm simply yours
I don't know why you try so hard
I'm simply yours and baby I won't go
'Cause I love you, boy, and I'm simply yours
Oh, baby, I won't go home
I love you, boy, and I simply yours
Baby, I don't know, I don't know
Why you try so hard, I'm simply yours
Baby, I won't go,'cause I love ya boy, I'm simply yours
I love ya boy,'cause I love ya boy
I love ya boy, I'm simply yours
Baby, I won't go
I love you boy, I'm simply yours
