Ave Maria
Thank you for the blessings that you have given us
Thank you for the love you've helped us find
In love we cherish beauty
Gentleness and laughter
These are things you always hoped for
Help us keep them too
Hey there Maria Santa
May we take the liberty to share our lives in harmony
May we ask of you to bless our love
Forever and ever
Amen, Amen
Oh, Amen
Singing Amen
