Give me your strong and hard working
Give me your hungry and your poor
Give me some, give me some with dedication
And those yearning for much more
Get rid of those rich ones and lazy
Throw out those safe and those secure
They've got no, no fire in their belly
They've got no, no street smarts for sure
Castle falls at midnight
King and Queen are gone
Sentries know we're coming
Midwives stay till dawn
Can't you taste our dreams
So clearly in our sight
Victory's ours for taking
Righteousness not might
All our dreams burst through
Victory's ours tonight
Give me six strong horses and men
With glint of cold steel in their eyes
Having no shadow of fear upon their faces
And no valley of tears in their eyes
Give me six strong women who'll fight
With courage, conviction, grit and might
I'll train them and prepare them for battle
Their souls are ready to ignite
Castle falls at midnight, king and queen are gone
Sentries know we're coming, midwives stay'til dawn
Can't you taste our dreams so clearly in our sight
Victory's ours for taking
Righteousness not might
Castle falls at midnight
King and Queen are gone
Sentries know we're coming
Midwives stay till dawn
Can't you taste our dreams so clearly in our sight?
Victory's ours for taking righteousness not might
All our dreams come true, victory's ours tonight
