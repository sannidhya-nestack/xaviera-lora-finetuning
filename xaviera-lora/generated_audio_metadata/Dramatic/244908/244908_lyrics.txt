She faced many closed doors
She sang with pride so dignified
Few had seen the likes of her before
Marian, Marian, sing us a song
Sing so the whole world might hear
Sing out for freedom, to right the wrongs
In our hearts your voice, your voice will be held dear
In 1925 she made her debut at Town Hall
Throughout the next forty years
Her singing helped bring down the walls of racial separation
She could bring tears to your eyes
When she sang my country, tears of thee
Its message could be realized
Marianne, Marianne, sing us a song
Sing so the whole world might hear
Sing out for freedom to right the wrongs
In our hearts your voice, your voice will be held dear
Marian, Marian
Marian, Marian
Marian, Marian, sing us a song
Sing so the whole world might hear
Sing out for freedom to right the wrongs
In our hearts your voice, your voice will be held dear
