I fall into your loving arms
You soothe me with your many charms
Then I wake and I'm all alone
I wish you were with me tonight
In my dreams I am searching for someone
In my life I am wanting for no one
But my dreams know me better than I do
All my life I've been waiting for you
I pretend that I'm not aware
Of these feelings I long to share with you
So I make out that I am fine alone
When really I hurt for your love
In my dreams I am searching for someone
In my life I am wanting for no one
But my dreams know me better than I do
All my life I've been waiting for you
All my life I've been waiting for you
