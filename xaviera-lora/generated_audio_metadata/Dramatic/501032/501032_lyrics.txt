Once upon a recent time
In a not so distant land
My fairy tales never came true
Genies, lamps and golden geese
I rarely saw such things as these
And balls at the palace were few
I gave up waiting for that charming prince
Who would arrive on my tear-stained
Battle of the Dragons on my lawn
And take good care of all my needs
And make all my dreams come true
Like one in Medusa's gaze
I thought that I had turned to stone
Too hard and unyielding to melt
Till I turned and there you were
Kissed my sleeping heart awake with passion that I'd never felt
Maybe not a prince, but one to me
With heart of gold and virtues true
You slayed my loneliness and set me free
To love myself and so love you
We'll spend our ever afters happily
Hand in hand and this will be
My fairy tale ending with you
