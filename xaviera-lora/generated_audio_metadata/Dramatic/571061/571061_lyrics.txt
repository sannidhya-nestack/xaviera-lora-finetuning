Writing lines for a melody
Writing lines that no one can see
Writing tunes that no one can hear
True secrets to you
I swear (whispering prayers to shooting stars)
My love for you from here to Mars
Waiting for the sunset in every dawn
Every tear's a thorn, every laugh is a tear
My unchained melody no one can hear
Try to hold on, never let me go, without you I'm not strong
Try to hold on, even though you can't see, I only belong to you
People screaming, who's wrong, who's right
A paranoid logic in the endless night
I see you in the doorway between love and hate
I'm running towards you before it's too late
Is it too late?
Try to hold on
Never let me go
Without you I'm not strong
Try to hold on
Even though you can't see
I only belong to you
In the merry-go-round of life
What falls down must rise high
Can't you see it in my eyes?
To you I can't lie
Try to hold on (to hold on)
Never let me go
Without you I'm not strong (I'm not strong)
Try to hold on (try to hold on)
Even though you can't see
I only belong to you
