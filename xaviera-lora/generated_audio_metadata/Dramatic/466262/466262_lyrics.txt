Seven days, the same coffee in the morning
Seven days, the same taste of loneliness
Seven days, I revel in my daydream to be free
Seven days, the same view out of my window
Seven days, the same colors on the wall
Seven days, I revel in my daydream to be free
I hear the noise behind the wall
Life is going on without me
I get older but I don't take part in life
Little bird on the wall
Let's fly across the fields
Already where you are
Seven days long
Seven days, the same coldness all around me
Seven days, the same place I have to go
Seven days I revel in my daydream
To be free
Seven nights I hear your voice speaking
Seven nights I hear you whisper in the dark
Seven nights I revel in my nightmares to die alone
I hear the noise behind the wall
Life is going on without me
I got all the bad I don't take part in life
Our little bird on the wall, let's fly across the fields or anywhere you want, seven days long.
Seven days long
Seven days long
