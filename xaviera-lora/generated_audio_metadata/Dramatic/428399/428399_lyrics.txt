Grandma booth on hairdos
Mom in polyester pants
This is what you see when you hanging at a dollar store parking lot
Young and thin, old and wide
Walking and shuffling like fire ants
Life's unique, living in a Tennessee camel lot
I ain't never seen a sight like this before
Everybody knows everybody's name and business
If you want to know the juicy gossip about your neighbor

Little kids pushing buggies, knocking down store displays
It's a lot of fun if it's not your kid that made a mess
Potato chips, ice cold pop
Perfect for the sugar crave
It's all here and there for your convenience
I ain't never seen a side lot this before
Everybody knows everybody's name and business
If you wanna know the juicy gossip'bout your neighbor
