You're the one I need, you're the one I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need
You're the one I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need, you're the one that I need
Don't you let me think you left me, who brought the brains of men, who are they?
And you'll keep my compass, and break the bread, and keep your love for me
