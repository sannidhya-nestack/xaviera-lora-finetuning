The girls come smooth like criminals
These girls they like to party hard
Got me losing my mind
They don't know time to say goodbye
It's not like they try to stay
All in my face and make me want more
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more
Bad energy away
Calling my name again
Don't be ringin' my phone again
I can't try to cope again
I try to do this your way
I can't have my way
But at the end of the day
You still want to blame my way
So I just lock up and drink up
So I ain't nothing to think of
It's like I'm fading faster way, way
And there's no reason more to stay
I'll be needing my space
The girls them smooth like criminals
These girls they like to party hard
Got me losing my mind
They don't know time to say goodbye
It's not like they try to stay
All in my face and make me want more
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more (It's not like they make me want more)
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more
Pull up in the white one
Sophisticated mouth
She wanna ride out
Roll up the Royzla with the brown or the white one
Pass me a light one
Turn off the light now
So we can play this all night long and we can make up or break up
But if we make up we'll make out
Take off your clothes and make you wet and you can make me want to touch your body
No no
Have a good time
It's all in my head
The girls them smoke like criminals
These girls they like to party hard
Got me losing my mind
They don't know time to say goodbye
It's not like they try to stay all in my face
And make me want more (one more)
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more (one more)
Make me want more
It's not like they make me want more
It's not like they make me want more, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dude, still stayin' on
