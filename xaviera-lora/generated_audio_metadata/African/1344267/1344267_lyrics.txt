Ready for a new day when the sun begins to rise
Need to wash my cares away
Can anyone hear my cries
Ready for a new day
The promise of a new day
Oh oh a new day
A new day
Ready for a new day when the sun begins to rise
Need to wash my cares away
Can anyone hear my cries
Ready for a new day
The promise of a new day, oh oh a new day, a new day
I've been down on my luck, about as deep as you can go
Was afraid I wouldn't get up, it made me feel so low
Life was stuck on a pause, a prisoner of poverty
Felt like a hopeless cause, trying to get myself free
I'm ready for a new day
When the sun begins to rise
Need to wash my cares away
Can anyone hear my cries?
Prayin' for a new day
Promise of a new day
Goodness will always prevail
My soul will be free
Justice deeps her scale
She'll shine a light on me
Goodness will always prevail
My soul will be free
Justice deeps her scale
She'll shine a light on me
I'm ready for a new day when the sun begins to rise
Need to wash my cares away
Can anyone hear my cries?
I'm praying for a new day
I promise of a new day
Woah woah a new day
A new day
I'm ready for a new day when the sun begins to rise
Need to wash my cares away
Can anyone hear my cries?
I'm praying for a new day
The promise of a new day
Oh oh a new day
A new day
I'm ready for a new day
When the sun begins to rise again
Need to wash my cares my cares away
Can anyone hear my, hear my cries
Prayin' for a new day
Promise of a new day
Mmm, whoa, whoa, a new day
Yeah, yeah, a new day
Prayin' for a new day
Good, good
Good, good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, goodness
Good, good, good, goodness
Good, goodness
