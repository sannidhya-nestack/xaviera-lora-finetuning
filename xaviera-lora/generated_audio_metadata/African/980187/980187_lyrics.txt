Your ink is the moonbeam
Your hand's my favorite pen
Your touch is calligraphy
Writing poetry on my skin
I'm lost in your bloom
We're still in Ophelia
Imagine you dancing through my room
In my sleeping cinema
You are the muse for these tunes
We're a terminal giver
Wish we were kissing under our moon
My equinox lover
My equinox lover, you are my equinox lover
Your eyes make my skies forever clear and never grey
Your hair is my altar
Your smile is to whom I pray
I'm lost in your bloom, with selenophilia
Imagine you dancing through my room, in my sleeping cinema
You are the muse for this tune, sweet atonement all giver
Wish we were kissing under our moon, my equinox lover
My equinox lover
You are my equinox lover
You are my equinox lover
You are my equinox lover
My equinox lover
