Just try it, please try it, it doesn't cost no money, please try it
Love yourself first and everything else
We fall into line
You really have to love yourself to get anything
Don't need this world
So please try it
Just try it
It doesn't cost no money
Please try it
DNA, yeah, I think it's your DNA
Mmm, na-na, DNA, hey, love is your DNA
It doesn't knock us no money, DNA, yeah, I think it's your DNA
Love is kind, DNA, love is beautiful (love is your DNA)
Yeah, it's easy to get lost
In the noise of this world
Remember who you are
And cherish the person you belong
Just try it
Please try it
DNA
Artificial DNA
Hmm na na

Baby
Love is your DNA
It does not cost no money

Artificial DNA
Love is kind DNA
Love is beautiful
Embrace your flaws
Artificial DNA
There is beauty in the chaos
Love is your DNA
Rest all your DNA
I think we're not enough now
Love yourself, love yourself, love yourself
Love is your DNA
