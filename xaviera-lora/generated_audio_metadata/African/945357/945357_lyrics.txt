We dem need
Free vibe on it
Say what he has said
Feel it, feel it
Before I slept, I ive my enemies
Last night, voice my michebi
Before I start, I need some energy
A new day's here women
Rest in peace to gone souls
Big ups to souls alive
Diem, ya bo me too
Baba God I thank you for my life
I say nyejumani didye rade
Mwa mi nene dere mi sankabibi
Nama famigale it, mi pepele te a face
Mi ke soku rampu pepele yeniti
One man's food is another man's poison
Unti mi nyejumani jo uko ye mesi
I jume biensa, aketriani ni nyea
Opportunity come by once dey also mukua
A new day has come, look ahead a sunshine
Bright, bright as your future
Unless you hustle, make me push harder
Else warm bright as the sunshine
A new day has come
It's an opportunity
A new day has come
I gotta go get it
A new day has come
You know?
A new day has come
(Somebody I see)
A new day has come
It's an opportunity
A new day has come
I gotta go get it
A new day has come
You know?
A new day has come
Every day is a chance to change your life
Ube time a your pastor, maybe you are not watching life
Just try to be better than you are yesterday
E nwa nami nibi, e nami jipe
Plan, plan your days, your weeks, your months and the years
Pray, pray every day before you begin
You are routine
Don't sleep and think it's gonna be alright
NBA said it, I hope say okay
Work it, work it and don't give up trying
Oye na a nye ya, wachenda saa try
To dream big that's in me, you have to sleep all day
Oda ka kra na wati wadi
It's a new day
Keep on pushing, I hope you gon make it
A new day has come
It's an opportunity
A new day has come
I gotta go get rich
A new day has come
You know
A new day has come
So what do you say?
A new day has come
It's an opportunity
A new day has come
I gotta go get rich
A new day has come
You know
A new day has come
It's a new day
Weezy baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey
