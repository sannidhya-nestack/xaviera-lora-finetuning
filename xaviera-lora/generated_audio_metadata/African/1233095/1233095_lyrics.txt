Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Your mommy cries tears of pain
She's got no food for you again
She tries hard to find a way
But nothing changes everyday
All your friends live the same
Is this life or just a game?
Your sister doesn't understand
Why there's no food in this land
Save the children
The children of the world
Save the children
The little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, save the children
Save the children of the world
Who gives world all so much fun?
Spare a thought for those who've none
It's not too late to shine your light
Help them through the darkest night
To build a better world
For the little boys and girls
Everyone should be the same
No more hunger, no more pain
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the little boys and girls
