Hennessy with a couple of pages
Scratch stuff, try to come up with the phrases
Of rappers that are gone in the praises
Moved up to a couple of places
Before we caught a couple of cases
Now my boy got a couple of cases
Off champagne with a couple of ladies
Red bones not enough on your faces
Red bottoms with a couple of laces
When we got em all talking abrasive
Gotta let the money talk to them races
Back then I was lost in the matrix
Now the world is my oyster oasis
Smoke good on the kush and Laysian
My flows way ill while they placing
Let's face it, I'm amazing
Hear the boom in the trunk when the bass hits
Came up on the front killin' bassheads
My life, my life is a movie
Laced up with a watch and a Gucci
We be skating on ice, I'm a Gucci
Put the safe on the ice for the luchi
I'm a bacon and pies in a coochie
And the cake gon' rise in a coochie
Blow smoke from cigars, Jacuzzi
Ladies chasing them stars, exclusive
Destination is Mars with the music
And our spaceship is cars when we do this
