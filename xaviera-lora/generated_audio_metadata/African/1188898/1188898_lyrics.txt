Please, stop the shooting, drop the gun
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Show some love, show some love
Let's make the world a happy place
Show some love, show some love
Some kindness
Show some love, show some love
Make the world a happy place
Show some love, show some love
Some kindness
We are farting up
It's time to show some love
I know you been hard, please drop the gun and give me a hug
Just imagine how beautiful this world would glow
With harmony each and everywhere we go
If we allow true love to flow
Oh no matter where you come from
No matter your religion
Please turn around and show some love
Angles deeper than what we see
And sometimes it's hard to believe
We didn't need to find the strength inside
To show some love and be kind
Just imagine how beautiful this world can be
When everybody live in love and harmony
Let us join hands because we can all agree
That love alone shall set us free
Show some love, show some love
Makes the world a happy place
Show some love, show some love
Some kindness
Pokaži mni ljubov u berega trmaja svit
Pokaži mni ljubov jak srce muzyka zvucit
Kan du forestella dey hy vake boran bet kan bara ve
Harmoni bat en vikor der sjeliken e stor
Okan der nu velaket
C'est la folie des hommes qui nous perd
Nous on veut que la paix, l'amour, la lumière
Non sentiamo più il dolore dell'umanità
Tendiamoci la mano e il mondo brillerà
Some love, some kindness
Pyaar dikha, pyaar dikha
Let's make the world a happy place
Pyaar dikha, pyaar dikha
Some kindness
