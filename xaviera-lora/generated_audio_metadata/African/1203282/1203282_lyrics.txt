Mama, uh, mama
Mama, uh, mama
In the world spinning so fast
You held us close to you, mama
Your love and strength, the one that shows
Through hardship, through highs, you've been our guide
You're a shining star, a beautiful queen
No matter how far, you've raised us all
With dignity and care, oh mama
Your goodness, generosity
Is beyond compare
And I sing
Mama, Mama Africa
Everybody loves you
Oh Mama
Mama, Mama Africa
Make make bomba, oh oh
Oh mama your heart is full of kindness true
You've taught us how to love in all that we do
You've sacrificed so much for our family's sake
And this love that you give is a legacy you make
You're a shining star
A bridge of hope when no matter how far
You've raised us all
With dignity and care, oh mama
Your goodness, generosity
Is beyond compare
That's why I sing
Mama, Mama Africa
Everybody loves you
