Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't chase, I attract, you know
You come close then you don't wanna go
Every time you say my name low-po
Feel the fire burning slow
You did talk but your eyes confess
Say you want this kind of stress
Late night, draw hands on my dress
You can fake that finesse
Tell me why you look so unsure
When you know you want some more
Boy I give you what you pray for
No lie you can't ignore
Stay small don't move too fast yeah
Love slow make the moment last oh yeah
You say baby you damn right uh huh
I say boy you never had this bad eye
Stay small no rush tonight yeah
Your vibe fit me just right oh yeah
Love me jet, jet hold me tight (uh-huh)
You gon' remember this for life (uh)
Soft touch, heavy intention (yeah)
We don't need no intervention (no)
You and I in slow dimension (oh)
Heartbeat on repetition (yeah)
Don't talk, just breathe, relax (relax)
Feel my skin, feel that tact (that tact)
Every move, every glance, we vibin'
No need to act
Tell me why you look so unsure
When you know you want some more
Boy I give you what you pray for
No lie you can't ignore
Stay small don't move too fast
Love slow make the moment last
You say baby you dead mad

Stay small no rush tonight
Your vibe fit me just right
