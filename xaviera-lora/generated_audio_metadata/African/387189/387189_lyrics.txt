Hey, yeah, oh, ah
I see they digging the soil
Trying to find my bones
No man can find me
If they don't know my roots
We see they come and go
Some stayed and died
Right before our eyes
In our mother's land
So much sacrifice
Both days and night
On our knees we pray
For better they say
Lord I once
Don't shine on me
Hey Lord I once
I said don't shine on me
You got my people dying everyday
They're recruiting us from child to dog
Big promises on politics
But we know their faces and we know their smells
They shed our blood from dusk till dawn
Say hey, yeah
You hear the children sing
You hear the people say
Lord
You hear the children say
Then we all say
Lord I want you
Don't shine on me
Hey Lord
I say don't shine on me, you got my people dying everyday
Get up, stand up and love your family
Put your fist up and have a unity
Stop all this greed and brutality
I begain thee to get up, stand up and love your family
Put your fist up and have a unity
Stop all this greed and brutality
