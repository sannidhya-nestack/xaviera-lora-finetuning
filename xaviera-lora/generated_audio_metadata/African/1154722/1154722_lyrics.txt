It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it, it, it's too late, it's too late
And I, I think I, I think I, I think I
And I, I think I, I think I think, I think I
I think I think I
And I, I think I, I think I think I
It's too early, it's too early, it's too early
It's too early, it's too early, it's too early
It's too early, it's too early, too early
It's too early, it's too early, it's too early
And now, it's too long, I've got nothing, it's too long, I've got nothing to lose
It's too long, it's too long, I've got nothing to lose
It's too long
