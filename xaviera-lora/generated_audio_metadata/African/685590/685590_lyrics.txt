Tonight on the dance floor, dancing on the dance floor tonight, tonight
Tonight on the dance floor, dancing on the dance floor tonight
DJ play my song, I wanna dance all night
I wanna keep it moving and all my troubles away
I'm gonna party all night like it's the end of the world
Wanna be happy tonight and all my worries away
For tonight is a night having fun all night
Yesterday is gone and today is here
And all my troubles away
And all my worries away
Tonight on the dance floor
Dancing on the dance floor tonight
Tonight, on the dance floor, dancing on the dance floor tonight (tonight, on the night, tonight, on the night)
Play my song, DJ play my song (play, play, play my song)
Play my song, DJ play my song (play, play, play my song)
Play my song, DJ play my song (play, play, play my song)
Play my song, DJ play my song (play, play, play my song)
Let's go
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
We don't know the reason we are here
DJ turn up the music
I am just getting started
I like my music so loud
No time for haters tonight
I am just getting freaky
I'll set this floor on fire
That's how we rock this party
No time for BS tonight
Put my hands up in the air
Put my hands up in the air
Put my hands up in the air
Put my hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air
Your hands up in the air
Tonight on the dance floor
Dancing on the dance floor tonight
On the right, on the right, on the right
Tonight on the dance floor
Dancing on the dance floor tonight
On the right, on the right, on the right
Play my song, DJ play my song
Play my song, DJ play my song
Play my song, DJ play my song
Play my song, DJ play my song (let's go)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I put my hands up in the air (I put my hands up in the air)
I put my hands up in the air (I put my hands up in the air)
I put your hands up in the air (I put your hands up in the air)
I put your hands up in the air (I put your hands up in the air)
