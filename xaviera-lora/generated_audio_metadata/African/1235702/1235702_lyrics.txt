Can you see me in the sky?
Can't be, can't be laid back
You're the reason we're here
And the sun is shining bright
We're the business
We're the people seen on you
We're the chief of stars
And the one who's got the sun in the sky
We're the people seen on you
We're the chief of stars
And the one
Kali chali sari
Tando rapo
Uka niso loma su
Dolo me lo si asin te sin su
Sasa muha
Nisha sumo uche penche
Nto mbo nsi ndi su
Kuli ui omapa
Fonte na sa me
Sombe isi
Kili ma zin kyo tam
House of love, house of love
House of love
Sha-fa-la-la-la-la-la-la
Isha moja
Come spirit
Come spirit
Se ke me se joho
Na prinko si nani
The chief is size and the love
Lejenda sa star in the sky
Na prinko si nani
The chief is size and the love
