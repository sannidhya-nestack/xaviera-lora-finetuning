Bass block come on, XSM come on
Chuh let's go
Lento ye no iklanga nanga
Like laser suits on my xenophobia
Me a rock it from the beginning until it's over
A smack em sober
Baka de baka de kipi me shoulder
Mshifte ba sade ba weh le pants
Weh mele mweh bet the end of the tunnel ikfanele ngafiga ngege ya chiga
That's the reason emang chuli de ba sotale ba zweet
Ba feed de bonana bu ba shilung
Shige ba zila bang bi sileng
Zile na sembling de dwe ni bona
Ngege ba fugen emang a 40 pointer ba uli silo yoke tabu gi
Pe pe pe pe piri piri (yog tabugi)

I'm a professional, I'm still as I'm unborn
The rappers aren't men enough to be men
That's why their dick falls and their foreskins can sold to Mexicans
See to their acts they're all becane and ain't no other one better than
Got a plan to beat rappers up, my T .G .M.
But until they don't want me to rap anymore
But I don't need them because the streets be where I be at
Make'em react they should relax my corner
They say the heart yeah I got him compressed
My bezel on and bad pay me but poorly if they workin' but sappy
Excessive means troll if I'm here game is cornered

Dabu gi pepe maja ngegu sasishaw aiming when I saw you missing the target
Ngenza inzi mbi mbini lebe ye marknit masterpieces be between
The devil and Jesus ngeng samisang klanen kafuli
So ngang bizi odomedike nchiza no more punchlines maja sengbabu isang eweeza
Askis mang klugu meze mizu ang itaniz
Zoki thizang kinli zangin finyisangin nyeza
Cause my truth be naked like them strippers at Jesus
And it's hard to please us true soldiers
Jemwo heili silash manje soya zifbo ngazi

I don't care who I run, quick or quartz, I'm go kick it, roach
Do sweet cause we know, neng on neng in net
And they be y'all know they say bad, so run in full and I'm a chair
And to the world don't need some bad, send the tickets
It's been time, so in both of the chats
And they be kissin' the spark, Punjabi when it's swag
The time is now when I decode and outpads
I'm songwording and I'm heads
I try not to rain to escape entertainment
And a replacement and
Saying it's tight will be another statement
So let me exit from the basement
In a jet I can't skate
