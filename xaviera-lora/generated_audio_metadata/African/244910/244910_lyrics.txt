Griot we are listening to every word you say
As I sit at your feet I can hear the beat as the ancient drummers play
Griot we are listening your stories fill our ears
The past unfolds as kings and queens of old suddenly appear
I can see the wisdom in your eyes
You possess a treasure more precious than gold
I have come to realize
There's so much that you know, Creole
Griot, we are listening to mankind's memory
You opened the door to those who came before
And what we used to be
I can see the wisdom in your eyes
You possess a treasure more precious than gold
I have come to realize
There's so much that you know, Creole
I can see the wisdom in your eyes
You possess a treasure more precious than gold
I have come to realize
There's so much that you know, griot
Oh, there's so much that you know, griot
Oh, there's so much that you know, griot
Oh great, oh great, oh, oh, oh
Oh great, oh great, oh, oh, oh
Oh great, oh great, oh, oh, oh
Oh great, oh great, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
