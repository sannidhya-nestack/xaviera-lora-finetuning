Here comes the night
We gonna lose the light
Summer night and the time is right
For the night light
There goes the day
Giving way to the smile
Summer breeze and the time is right
For the night life
I remember what the day did to me
I bare my scars to the moonlight
I walk it off, I shake it off when the night comes
I belong to the night
And I feel more alive with these night vibes
Just give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Let me hide from the light
Give me the night, just give me the night
Give me the night, let me hide from the lies
E hiti piti mbene ka piti rambene
Slice ambene ka noka nambene tatu nambene
Edne mo seke la manan ba pama
Mo mwenyo pama mo shadi shanji pama
Mo meri puran ba pama
Give me the night
I remember what the day did to me
I bare my scars to the moonlight
I walk it off, I shake it off when the night comes
I feel long to the night
And I feel more alive with these night vibes
Just give me the night, give me the night
Give me the night, let me hide from the light
Give me the night, just give me the night
Give me the night, let me hide from the lights
I remember what the day did to me
I bare my scars to the moonlight
I walk it off, I shake it off when the night comes
I feel long to the night
And I feel more alive with these night vibes
Just give me the night, give me the night
Give me the night, let me hide from the light
Give me the night, just give me the night
Give me the night, let me hide from the lights
'Cause I belong to the night
And I feel more alive with these vibes
Give me the night
