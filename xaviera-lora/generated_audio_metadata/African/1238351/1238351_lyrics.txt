Yo what's going on man
Got a lot of things in my head right now man
Everything just a happening man
Rich man de ball, poor man de dog, doggy dog walk
Damn man, he wack, gaff the bands, me count for listen
See my people suffer, political squander
Rich man de banner, how low?
Poor man de holla, rich man de squander
Big man wahalla, how low?
I say nah cry me, I say nah cry me, I say nah cry me
Oh Lord, oh no, I run the hustle daily
Tell them haters better watch it when they say my name in
Minds on ballin' daily, fashion lookin' wavy
I beg you stop the killin', stop the lootin', share you feel me?
And money canna bani, you hold me through the pain
People just they suffer, cause everything goes kata, see them they yawa
Oh no, people just they suffer, see them they hala
Oh no
Oh no, mi ka do te te de, mi ka do no she re, mi ka do no de play
Oh no, see my people suffer, for poli to kamato, wonder wonder wonder
Oh no, see me see wa ala e, man de work no king de chop, come de go and no de wanto
Oh no, see my people suffer, still nobody bother, aswe no matter
Oh no, ase na kwameu
I say not grace walk you daddy (I'm a Kweme, I'm a Kweme, I'm a Kweme, I'm a Kweme, I'ma Kweme, I'ma Kweme)
Oh Lord, I say not grace walk you daddy (I say not grace walk you daddy)
Just think about it, know even what about it (what about it)
I know say one day it ain't going to hit a million (it ain't going to hit a million)
But don't you worry'bout it
I know say one day you also go to jail
My brother brought you, I know I see your struggles
Running everyday, you cannot see the tears
But people crying, feet are dying, no one cares about it
I pray say one day you'll go down to jail
We go elevate and we go regulate and
I no say one day you go appreciate oh
As I talk my mind up shout out to my neto
I no say one day you go celebrate oh
Ipa pure, ausu mpre, ausu gope
Ase na kweme uu, ase na kweme uu, ase na kweme uu, ase na kweme ui, ase na kweme ui, aze na kweme ui, aze na kweme ui, aze na kweme ui
Oh Lord
I say nah grace what be that? (Aww)
I say nah grace what be that? (Awww)
I say nah grace what be that? (Awwww)
I say nah grace what be that? (Ahhh)
