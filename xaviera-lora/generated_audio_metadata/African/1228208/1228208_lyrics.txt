Yeah man
Melly side what's happening
African dragon
What up brother
Me and this spiritual warfare the common eyes can't see
But if you open up your third eye on the bright side
The right side you gon' see
Now this the battle for your soul though the world's cold
I just wanna see the city full of gold
Tell that kingdom come
Thy will be done
I know you want me to be just like you
But I'm not evil
Good deeds follow me
I'd walk this lonely road
God is the only one I fear
You tried to cast a spell on me
But, but I can't go for that (Fire, fire, fire)
You go burning hell for that
Fire, fire, fire
You go burning hell today
Just leave me alone, just leave me alone
I've been on my own, somebody call my phone
There's something going on
Get away from my door,'cause I can't take it anymore
You need to walk away,'cause you're really starting to bother me
Only one question, what did I do to you?
You can't sleep the night
You have to hunt my soul
What did I do to you? (Aye)
I'm a better one as is in a woman
What goes around comes back around (yeah)
Now you got fire (fire)
Fire burning
The almighty's fire (fire)
Wrath upon you
All sisters fire (fire)
For the evil on the earth, yeah
My angels fire (fire)
I am one with the gasoline
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fire, fire, fire, you go burning hell forever
Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya, Maya
You go burning half way (leave me, leave me alone)
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone (leave me alone)
I've been on my own (I've been on my own)
Somebody call my phone (my phone)
There's something going on (yeah)
Some of you actually got that gift from the universe
You're just using the wrong way
I know you want me to be just like you
But I'm not evil
Good deeds follow me
I'd walk this lonely road
God is the only one I see
You try to cast a spell on me
But, but I can't go further
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, hey, if you stand for me
Trust me you gon' feel, you gon' burn in hell
I just hope this isn't your world
An eternal damnation
Divine Inc. (yeah)
Frase Pierre (what up brother)
Melissa (the African dragon)
Let's get up
Fire burn them, fire burn them
You know your ancestors
Now we rise
