Yélé, yélé, yélé, yélé
Notre monde va très mal
L'amour il règne et
Notre monde va très mal
Les gens ne veulent pas m'huiler
Wake up, stand up, under your own struggle
We must come together as one
Tell a nombrillon à sa mère
Yalleh, yalleh, yalleh
We are the world
Together as one
We are the world
Together as one
Yeah
Let our spirit rise
Ooh
Yeah
From every corner, from every land
We got the future in our hand
Let your voice be heard
We break the chain, we turn the tide
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Standing tall
Woah oh oh oh
We have the world, give our all in unity
Together as one, hand in hand, side by side
We have the world, we will conquer the darkness
Together as one, with our blood and our soul
Unknow your ancestors
Now we rise
