Yo, boy, Charlie, where you dey?
Yo, bro, I dey in de studio
I dey on de mic, on de mic, later, yeah
You put me into pains
You fall into pains three times
You know nothing about me?
So, nigga, you better shut up
All you fools conclude without observing
You tell me one thing, I start a survey
Adényi wèdjimi, you call yourself educated but you wèdjimi
Mwiti mwifi ena me hwonsem na mwoka
Free vibe by itself, free vibe di wongfata
Wèdjimi ya me shosorasta nè ganja
Emami boomf we na gana blaze ina habesa
What a punch
Nama chena tuwa bow, bow to senda
Eba fast, sede me ye zenda
Beswa pane ye wak, emfane nkompe me da
Fremi tu pak, me koya masaba
E dronia, e droni, e drobian kadem
Mi wia mu mi huajim, ma ponchia pam pam
Se musi moti e dada nesa ma bre
Maba weye ni unti ne mung fan sisem
The game is about to begin
Mortal Kombat or say round one fight
Kwa na mi ti ni ti
Floral victory te se wa mo me wan
Sa fe de sa fe de mo je de mo je de
Se ma ni mi ni mi ti no u bie ni ho
Unyebio unyebio hala me hala me
Facebook twitter na google me for more
Fee-Five, G-H, it's Fee-Five, Fee-Five, G-H on the mic (hey)
Fee-Five, G-H, it's Fee-Five, Fee-Five, G-H on the mic (hey)
On the mic (hey), on the mic (hey), hey, hey (hey)
I like the way you do it if you do it your best
Me baby I'm about to do my nyan best girl manifest
Punches need flow best up before country test
My ex is saying so me nima all is west
Free vibe in the building where my homies sat
Now the me who know how high they riding me in a hat
Coco 2 a drone a rap more mini size
What you be what feel it yeah and you nice
Everybody clapping while lady even clapping
Who hates what's up we not came here to fight eh
Stop that bitch nigga I'm a different level
Do your thing make her do my thing
Just a free style, different rap style
Makili beat it now you a lazy man me next one
Feeling so high, high high high
Me original me a rastantini me pe wine
Me penna me rap we ne de se mid pie
To be sure banise me nuwo inna i crying
Jah almighty wa show dem a side
Me show no time for nibaye even in the night
Let me take it down once more
Me show no time for nibaye even in the night
Let me take it down once more
Say what he has here
Free vibe on it
Ouhu se ne namo sana nye se ne bibi ae
Say what he has here
We there on the mic 24 /7
From the studio to my house
From my house to studio
That's how we do it everyday
Say what he has here
Free vibe on it
