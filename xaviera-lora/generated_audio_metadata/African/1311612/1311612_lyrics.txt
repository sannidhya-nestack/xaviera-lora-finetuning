Diversity and all its beauty
Colonialism
A painful bloodshed between hard and duty
New tribes had to rise
Politics of before and after
A nation of people cries
Pray to restore laughter of our children of
Africa our homeland Africa
We speak in many tongues
But share a common bond
Souvenirs of the past are among memories far beyond
Enslavement of our people
Africa is free
Filled with skin of every color
Diversity in all its beauty
Colonialism
A painful blow turned between heart and duty
New drives had to arise
Politics of before and after
A nation of people cries
Pain to restore laughter of our children of Africa
Our homeland Africa
I, I, I, I, I, I, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, what was that? (Ooh) Africa (ah) what was that? (Ooh) Africa
