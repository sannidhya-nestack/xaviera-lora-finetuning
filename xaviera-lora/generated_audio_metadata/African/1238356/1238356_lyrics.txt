Somebody bout to lose their life, I know the child just got born
A crackhead about to use that pipe, I know the person overdosing on wine
Man they putting poisons in our foods, there's a psycho killer in our schools
You can see it when you watching the news, I feel sad tryna rap in this booth
Right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now somewhere some place in the world somebody's daughter just got raped
Right now some place in the church somewhere somebody's soul just got saved
Right now somebody just died the cancer cigarette money just got made
Right now somewhere in the world somebody getting paid tryna run back slaves
Right now somebody just found out and learned from the doctor that they have AIDS
How you deal with the news like that
How you walk in them shoes like that
What's worse, man, the youth like that
A lot of young girls in the hood like that
If you live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
See the youngins in the hood, they gon' shoot right back
Growing up, I never knew my dad
Mama said that I look like that
Hell no, man, I wish I never looked like that
I took my bag, tryna make my tracks
When the world got broke, had to move right back
Take a walk in my shoes, I'm mad
Heart full of anger, clutching a banger
Gotta hustle, born out of hunger
How to learn how to cook that crack
How to learn how to move that pack
Dodging them lights, how to lose that fast
How to move like flash, like whoosh I'm back
Somebody about to lose their life
I know the child just got born
A crackhead about to use that pipe
Another person overdosing on wine
But they putting poisons in our foods
Just a psycho killer in our schools
You can see it when you watching the news
I feel sad tryna rap in this booth
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Now imagine this, five kids in the crib with a mom and they're broken to projects
In a house full of rats, in a bed full of bugs, in a room full of broken closets
With a pan full of grease, no fan for the heat, in the kitchen with a broken faucet
With a floor full of piss, no food in the fridge and the walls full of open sockets
All we had was the Lord and a soul full of faith and a heart full of broken promise
I got a table full of open bottles, tryna soak in my open problems
Sat down with a pen and an old notebook tryna write out my wholesome problems
No drinks, no pills, no shrinks, no frills, no smokes, no hope can solve'em
I need when the reverend packing, world peace will never happen
Man the world getting close to an end
So you better get close to your kin before you go
You better hug them try to hold them man
Girl you never know when you can hold them again
When you gone when you gone like a ghost in the wind
Like a ghost in the wind
Somebody bout to lose their life
I know the child just got born
A crackhead about to use that pipe
I know the person overdosing on wine
Man they putting poisons in our foods
He's a psycho killer in our schools
You can see it when you watching the news
I feel sad trying to rap in his booth
Right now right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
