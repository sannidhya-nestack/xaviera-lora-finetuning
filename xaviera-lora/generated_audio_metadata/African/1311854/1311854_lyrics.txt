Falling like the leaves of autumn
Things are spinning out of control
It feels like I've hit rock bottom
When I look deep into my soul
I see
I'm falling, I'm falling
As silent as a falling star
Life changes can be out of sight
Unless you decide
That you care to look into the light
I knew that I was falling
Fully, fully
The first time I felt down so hard
I didn't think I could stand
Concerned and parted
Life didn't go as I planned
Each time I failed I had my doubts
If I could find resilience
I wasn't sure what figured things out
But inside there's a fiery brilliance
That caught me when I was falling, falling
Sometimes I think the sky is falling
Patterns of pain repeat and repeat the
M .L. your voices
Always calling, I've been knocked down by
I'm not beat, life losses happen more
The first time I felt down so hard I didn't think I could stand
Cornered and bombarded, life didn't go as I planned
Each time I fell I had my doubts
If I could find resilience I wasn't sure
I'd figure things out
But inside there is a fiery heat
Treasons that guided me when I was falling, ooh, falling
