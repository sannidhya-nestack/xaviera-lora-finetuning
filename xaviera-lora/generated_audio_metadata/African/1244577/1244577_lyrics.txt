I'm trapped in this place
In that song factory
We sit hard and no use, never sleep, sleep
No escape from this musical maze
It's got the end of days
Our mind is lost, caught up in this rhythmic craze
Robotic melodies that control my every move
Syncopated drums making my body groove
But I'm a prisoner'til the sound can't break free
The 80's that we locked through them soul in me
Syncopated flashbacks keep my heart racing
Senses buzzing like I hide my mind's embracing
But deep down I'm yearning for something real
Lost in this virtual world trying to find the fuse
Syncopated brass blasts keeping my heart racing
Sensors buzzing like I hide my mind's embracing
But deep down I'm yearning for something real
Lost in this virtual world trying to find the feels
