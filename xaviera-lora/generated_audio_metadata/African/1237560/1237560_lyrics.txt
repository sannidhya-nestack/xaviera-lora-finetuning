Vibes, only the good ones
Put me on if you sure this are the pure ones
Cause you see in this life you only live once

Stop right there I can feel your energy
Once it was pure before the greed started setting in
Money can't buy all no need for settling
I can feel you waiting for me just to settling
Boy you treat me like a job so you can carry me
But my mother still they pray for me
Do you so no need to wait on me
Cause I do the same for me
Balancing equation on it
