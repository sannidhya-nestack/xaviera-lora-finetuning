Spirits of Africa
Deep within each African heart
Brown from the soil of the land
One in the soul of each man
Bright like the moon and the stars, spirits of anger
Spirit of Africa, Spirit of Africa
Spirit of Africa, Spirit of Africa
Spirit of life, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drink my blood with you
Nigeria, you've got to drink Nigeria
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Spirits of Africa, let not be stepped on again
Now that your soul's in this land, freedom is both yours and mine
No slavery, no no from above
The spirits of Africa
The spirits of Africa
Deep within each African heart
Brown from the sorrow of the land
One in the soul of each man
Bright like the moon and the stars
Spirit of Africa
Bring my body, we need you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Nigeria
You got the strength
Nigeria
You need me over here
We love you
You need me over here
Turn my body, we need you, Nigeria, you got the strength
Light in your heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Meet me on the hill
We'll love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
