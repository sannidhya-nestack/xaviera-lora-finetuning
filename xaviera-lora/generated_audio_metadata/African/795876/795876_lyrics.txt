Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I'd say to you, I want to be here
Between my heart and my soul
I'd have to go six times
I'm bored and I'm tired
You're a question mark
I think of you, I'd have to ask you a question
I'd have to, I'd have to, but I don't want to know why
Afkero mefagentza gano me lamet
Endera siargen indi se vodish
Atra kin kainesef legalitash
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Nes alkerre linyu (nes)
Endiaf se vodish (oh)
Menisha linyas (yes)
Melat ahulish (yes)
I'll get ready in your face
And I'll see what I do (how)
Many challenges (many days)
But I'll tell you this girl
Tell me why I'm good with all (girl)
Tell me why don't you be mine (girl)
Tell me why I'm good with all (girl, girl)
Tell me why don't you be my girl
Surely you have become a see
Nothing can be better than your fancy
Surely you don't have to worry
Come get in and make love so hurry
I'll tell me why I'm good with all girls
Tell me why don't you be my girl
Tell me why I'm good with all girls
Tell me why don't you be my girl
And I'm sitting late
Can you hear that cry?
Kalbainim li bainim
Terish si tawat
Mala w nasabik
Antioos tishwal
Befikir tak ilish
Terash gis tishwal
Andu landu manore dino mawadej
Askro mafakil sa gano malamej
Yeni selet selet fekri chameral
Kayewis jemero kalve kantu kerbal
Oh oh oh oh oh Ness
Al kerre linyu Ness
Endiaw sivodius
Meni shalinyas melat ahulis Ness

And I'll see what it's all about
