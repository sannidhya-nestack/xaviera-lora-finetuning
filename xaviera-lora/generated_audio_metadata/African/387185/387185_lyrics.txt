Don't bite the hands that feed you
What goes up must come down
Don't bite the hands that feed you
Hey what goes up must come down
How we're living in this world today is like a dream
Jungle everyday just trying to get paid
How we living in this world today
See struggles everyday just building more pain
Take a look in my eyes and tell me what you see
You see the vision of a warrior fighting for survival
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
You see the vision of a warrior fighting for survival
I pray for this pain to go away
Monday, Monday, Monday
One day, say I pray for this pain to go away
One day, one day, one day, one day
Too many nights I pray, too many days I sing
So many sacrifices I made, too many bullshit I take
Telling the fairy tales, man this is how I live
Got a wife and two boys and a daughter on the way
Dripping crack, parking gas, I don't fuck with these rats
Smoking eggs everyday, wishing this pain would go away
Bust some grips on these jakes, cause they tryna pull me away
Couple AK's and MK's will fix ya niggas face so
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, once goes up
Mars come down, don't bite the hands that feed you
Hey what goes up
Mars come down, how we living in this world today
Like a jungle everyday just trying to get paid
How we living in this world today
See struggles everyday just building more pain
Take a look in my eyes and tell me what you see
The vision of a warrior fighting for survival
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
The vision of a warrior fighting for survival
I pray for this pain to go away
One day, one day, one day
Say I pray for this pain to go away
One day, one day, one day, one day
