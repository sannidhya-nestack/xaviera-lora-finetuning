You say to me, your tears will dry
You say to me, you'll soon be moving on
You say to me, you'll be better off without me and it's true
But you don't know how it feels
You don't know what it's like to be on your own
When someone's shouting your dreams and you're alone
Don't tell me what to feel, oh, oh, oh
Don't tell me what to do, oh, oh, oh
Don't tell me I don't live my life
I do it better than you
Yes I do
I say to you, I won't be strong
I say to you, I know my tears won't dry
I say to you, I'm still hurting, I'm not ready to move on
And you don't know what it's like
You don't know about the doubts and the sleepless nights
And nothing's given, it's not on you on your own
Don't tell me what to feel, oh, oh, oh
Don't tell me what to do, oh, oh, oh
Don't tell me I don't live my life
I do it better than you
Yes I do
I don't want you to tell me what to feel
Don't tell me what to feel
Tell me what to do, oh-oh
Don't tell me what to feel, oh-oh
Don't tell me what to do, oh-oh
Don't tell me I don't live my life
I do it better than you
Yes I do
