You rockin' with the best (yeah)
No, no
No sorrow (yeah)
No, no
It's Hitmakers for life, baby
I've been drinking and I've been thinking about the life a nigga been living
And if I go I hope I know I lived a life without regret or sorrow
I've been drinking and I've been thinking about the life
A nigga been living and if I go
I hope I know
I'll live the life without regret or sorrow
It's all for a state I had to take a stand
Against the man that tried to take me to a foreign land
And we'll all know
If I didn't bring my rifle
today I figured out he was my rival
If I died tonight I pray to love my soul to keep
Only blunt sense, he wrote a cup, my fucking keep
Tell my mommy we established so she shouldn't weep
Tell the judge he can rest my case I'm in a better place
Stepping with the lord, open pearly gates
I'm dancing with the stars I ain't need no relegate
The devil hating on me cause my soul he never ache
But please thank the lord that that nigga ready dead
I've been drinking and I've been thinking about the life
A nigga been living
And if I go
I hope I know
I lived a life without regret or sorrow
I been drinking and I been thinking about the life
A nigga been living
And if I go
I hope I know
I lived a life without regret or sorrow
Sipping on his hand a nigga reminiscing
Thinking bout my life what it is and what it isn't
If I die tonight I beg you take care of my children
I'm riding out tonight you got your gloves I got my weapon
There's no half stepping in this life my niggas living
My bro got caught with a burn and now they got him caged in
Sitting in the pen four walls contemplating
He could be lying in a wooden box on his way to heaven
I've been drinking and I've been thinking about the life a nigga been living
And if I go I hope I know I lived a life without regret or sorrow
I've been drinking and I've been thinking about the life
A nigga been living and if I go
I hope I know
I'll leave the life of our regret or sorrow
I had to take a step (yeah)
A beast of man that tried to take me to a foreign land (no, no)
Wonder if I didn't know my pride and sorrow
Today I figured out he was my pride (yeah)
No sorrow, yeah, yeah
It's Hitmakers for life baby (always)
