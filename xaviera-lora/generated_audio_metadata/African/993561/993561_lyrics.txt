Here we go, trying to make you understand
What you see is what you get
We don't fake and we don't break
Are you my date? I gotta make you understand
Step into my world and let me show you how
Kapana no ka salsa, nyama po makara
Fat cooking on rust
We got ourselves a date
I didn't promise you much
And this is not a movie
And this is what I got
All I got for you is pure love
Kapana love, Kasi love
Straight from the heart baby
Step into my world
All I got for you is pure love
Kapana love, Kasi love
Straight from the hood
Now step into my world
All I got for you is your love
Kupana love, Kasi love
Straight from the heart
And this is what I got for you
Now are you going or staying the night?
All I got for you is your love
Kupana love, Kasi love
Bring it down now
Number six in the jukebox
Castellano puña puña
Mixed with a na-mu-na-te
Na, mejor viraje
