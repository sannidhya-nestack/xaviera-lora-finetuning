The beat inside it, it never lies
A steady drum beneath the skies
It whispers secrets in the dark
A pulse that sparks a vital spark
Through every rise, through every fall
It keeps the rhythm through it all
A silent song that leads the way
Guiding us to seize the day
Feel the rhythms of the heartbeat
A melody that can't be beat
Dancing through the night and day
It shows the path, it lights the way
In chaos loud, it still remains
A soothing sound through joy or pain, pain
A compass pointing
Deep inside where truth and passion both reside
Close your eyes and hear the sound
The heart beats rhythm all around
A harmony that pulls us near
It speaks the words we long to hear
Feel the rhythms of the heartbeat
A melody that can't be beat
Dancing through the night and day
It shows the path, it lights the way
It lights the way
And life's going
