Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We've just fallen in love
I've been looking for love
Yes you know that I love you
I was lost then I found you
I opened my heart for you
And it became such a show
Ouh eh zahiti ahi
Yeah, I'm new
Yeah, I'm new
Yeah, I'm new
Running in the black forest no way out
Living in the room where the light been turned down
Lost all my life
There comes life
Which you are see live
Been searching and searching but found nothing
But only heart breaks
Broken souls
Broken minds
Broken beings
That's broken me
Who has an easy eye
Yeah, I need, yeah, I need
