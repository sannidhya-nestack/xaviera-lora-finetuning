Tens mish me no funde fo kuchida
Nene wa nimo
Representing Africa
I'm dropping this fool on my street dwellers
Thug fellas money making
Shrump shakin'
Smokin' Garcia Vegas up in Vegas
Phone maker
Beginnin' to end
Lyrics extend to the farthest regions
My style changes like the seasons
A newcomer
I'm'bout to drop a album this summer
Catch me in the streets of Africa
Droppin' a black Hummer
Shaka Zulu
There's my tutu
I'm pointin' at you too, you phony
You think your style is fab but it's pony
Go go go go
Ayy gongola, gongola
Santa Ana
Dubos wa na eya, you can't compare ya
Me to the rest, born African but now I rest in the west
Oyiz, oyiz, emcees try to test
Oyiz, oyiz, mess around get put to rest
Oyiz, oyiz,'cause Nemo bring heat
Oyiz, oyiz, I'm dropping this one for the streets
Your styles are incomplete, emcees please please wipe your feet
And take a seat as I begin to speak
Voodoo like Rafiki, Nemo's the African lion
I'll leave you dying, I'll have you more
All my USA people are bumpin' this
All my people out in Africa are bumpin' this
All my Asian homeboys are bumpin' this
All my European brothers are bumpin' this
London bumpin' this
Tokyo bumpin' this
Zambia bumpin' this
New York bumpin' this
Kenya bumpin' this
Zimbabwe bumpin' this
LA bumpin' this
The whole world bumpin' this
Like two boxes of chocolates, he don't know what you get
Russian roulette, we playin', I'm sayin'
One day you on top, the next you not,'cause life is real
All you young brothers know the deal, cats get peeled
With the A + ones called the steel,'cause I feel
The wages of sin is death without honor, I be upon ya
I went from Africa to California
From LA to Zimbabwe, I'm international, you're local
USA to Morocco, MC's a sorcerer, the way that I be dropping hits
The way my lyrics switch like a female, send it through like email
The N-E-M-O about to blow, but you didn't know
If you don't know, act like you know, now you know
In Cairo, I heat stuff up like a pyro, the Africano
On occasion smoking marijuana, illegal
I represent my African people eating sandwiches
I even rap in different languages, oh my USA
All my people out in Africa are bumpin' this
All my Asian homeboys are bumpin' this
All my European brothers are bumpin' this
London bumpin' this, Tokyo bumpin' this, Zambia bumpin' this
New York bumpin' this, Kenya bumpin' this, Zimbabwe bumpin' this
LA bumpin' this, the whole world's bumpin' this
De ti muishi be mama (we international)
De ti muishi be dada (we international)
De ti muishi be mama (we international)
De ti muishi be dada (we international),
De ti muishi be mama (we international)
De ti muishi be dada (we international, we international)
De ti muishi be mama (we international)
De ti muishi be dada (we international).
Close my eyes, regain my strength, I'm in my place of birth
For what it's worth, I really hated on this planet earth
Cause I was born broke, but I'd be damned if I died broke
I let my brain soak and we smoke, imagine that
My life's complex like a game of chess
My mind's a rubix, many people wonder how I do this
Versatile, young but wise like the golden child
I'm an apostle of this life that be semi-hostile
My life's a castle built on sink and sand
People don't understand
I got plans to discover other lands, my future's grinned, I see it
But before then, if I die, so be it
That's life, I wanna live nice and stay humble
I walk the streets watching society crumble
As poverty stings like ghee and add the bumble
As people rumble for jewels in this concrete jungle
I'm thinking rational and keep it international (oh my man)
Say people are bumping this
All my people out in Africa are bumpin' this
All my Asian homeboys are bumpin' this
All my European brothers are bumpin' this
London bumpin' this
Tokyo bumpin' this
Zambia bumpin' this
New York bumpin' this
Kenya bumpin' this
Zimbabwe bumpin' this
LA bumpin' this
The whole world's bumpin' this
MC's try to test
Mess around get put to rest
Nemo bring heat
I'm dropping this one for the streets
Go go go go
Ay, Congola, Santa Ana
Tu vos guana ella
Y que compaya
Lead to the rest
Born African but now
Rast in the west, oh yes
MC's try to test, oh yes
Mess around get put to rest, oh yes
Cause we gon break heat, oh yes
I'm dropping this one for the streets
Go go go go, and the hoes try to test
Go go go go, mess around get put to rest
Go go go go, we gon break heat
Go go go go, I'm dropping this one for the streets
Go go go go, and the hoes try test
Go go go go, mess around get put to rest
