Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh
There's nothing but love in your eyes
All the things you do now
So much light in your eyes
Does anyone around here trust in this world?
You have to do what you like
Abide in the trust of life
May you intend to be happy forever
Ha ha happy forever
Aye aye aye forever
Aye aye aye forever
I, I, I, forever
I, I, I, forever
I, I, I, forever
I, I, I, forever
I, I, I, forever
I, I, I'll be forever
Ever
Ever
I'll be forever
Ever
Ever
Ever
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
