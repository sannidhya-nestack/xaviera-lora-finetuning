Save the children, the children of the wild
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Save the children, the children of the wild
Save the children, the little boys and girls
Your mommy cries tears of pain
She's got no food for you again
She tries hard to find a way
But nothing changes everyday
All your friends live the same
Is this life or just a game?
This is time to sit and understand
Where there's no food in this land
Save the children, the children of the wild
Save the children, little poison cats
Save the children, the children of the wild
Save the children, little poison cats
Save the children, save the children, save the children of the world
In this world of so much fun
Spare a thought for those of none
It's not too late to shine your light
Help them through the darkest night
We need to build a better world
For the little boys and girls
Everyone should be the same
No more hunger, no more pain
Save the children, the children of the world
Save the children, the children of the wild (Save them, save them, save the children, save the children of the wild)
Save the children from the poison gods
Save the children from the poison gods
Save the children from the poison gods
