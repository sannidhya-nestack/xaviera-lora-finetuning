As the night dies, I just think of you
But what can I do but just dream on through
I'm a sky above, I'll break down
I gotta see you sometime
Make it tonight, I wanna see you tonight
Make it tonight, I wanna see you tonight
Make it tonight, I wanna see you tonight
Make it tonight, I wanna see you tonight
Ooh, think of you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Dream on through)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Down)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sometimes)
Oh, oh, oh
Naked tonight
I wanna see you tonight (Dream on through)
Naked tonight
I wanna see you tonight (Down)
Naked tonight
I wanna see you tonight
Mickey tonight, I wanna see you tonight
