Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lisa wings, Lisa dragging me in
I need you baby, shine lights and light in your bed
Lisa's voice, Lisa's voice in the pump
It's so soft, like a melody
I never heard a thing or heard a sound so sweet
Or I ever need
Oh Lisa I know you and I love it
Oh Lisa I know you and I love it
Oh Lisa I know you and I love it
Oh Lisa I know you and I love it
Oh Lisa, I know you ain't not love it
Lisa, I know you ain't not love it
Lisa, I know you ain't not love it
Lisa, I know you ain't not love it
Oh yeah
Lisa, I know you ain't not love it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
