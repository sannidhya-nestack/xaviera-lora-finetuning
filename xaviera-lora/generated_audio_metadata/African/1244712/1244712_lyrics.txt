Ain't nothing you can do to the hustler
Why don't you be cool to the hustler?
Ngaas banga ling ting a jange fast trap
Why don't you be cool useka slump
All those hoes you chose or noticed
Always know those hoes they know this
Chalimenga has cooler than coke on ice
Hustling every day to the pope post-op
While the lies and religion in the pope won't stop
The lies and the truth but the people won't talk
Dump that blind
We just wanna party spitzel and step blind
Ain't like why, we just wanna party, spittin' in the night (everyday)
Let's get right, we just wanna party if the bitch is bad (everyday)
Every freaking day, every freaking night
I wanna party like everyday
Every freaking day
Every freaking night
I wanna party like everyday
Time and time and time again
I party everyday
Party everyday
Party everyday
Time and time and time again
I party everyday
Party everyday
Party everyday
Yeah I always been hood, nothing to solve you know really I'm good
I ain't got problems in the bangin straight
Weno ya bora if bebe zi great
Bebu yang tola so tege zi skate
Beses ya pola ma bebe zi straight
Naksasa kut kola wala tlase angena aspuma netol
Every day, every freaking day
Every freaking night, I wanna party like
Every, every, every, every, every, every day
Ain't like why, we just wanna party, spittin' in them nines (every day)
Let's get right, we just wanna party if the bitch is bad (every day)
Every freaking day
Every freaking night
I wanna party like
Every day
Every freaking day
Every freaking night
I wanna party like
Every time and time and time again
I party every day
Party every day
Party every day, party every day
Time and time and time again
I party every day, party every day
Party every day
