No, I won't lie for you
Sometimes I try to excuse it, babe
Burn the bridges, now I see
What you're truly like (yeah)
So don't waste my time
I don't feel when you running out of love
I'm tired of cooking up excuses
Pretty stranger I'm losing all my trust
my soul found a homestead was stupid
Is it weird'cause I'm tripping?
What you said did you mean it?
Sama kuli wan biliki
Nime choka kusubiri yeah
No I won't lie to you
Sometimes I try, excuse it baby
Burn the bridges now I see
What you're truly like
So don't waste my time
No I won't lie to you
Sometimes I try, excuse it baby
Burn the bridges now I see what you're truly like
So don't waste my time
No I won't lie for you
Sometimes I try excuse it baby
Burn the bridges now I see what you're truly like
So don't waste my time
