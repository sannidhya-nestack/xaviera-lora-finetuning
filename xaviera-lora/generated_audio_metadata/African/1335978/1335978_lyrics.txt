Holy man, holy man, holy man
Sure I miss you (Holy man, holy man)
Holy man, sure I miss you
Holy man, holy man
Shawty I miss you
They said I never cry for you holy man
God knows everything I did for you to have a better life before you die, holy man
You are the king of kings, holy man
See you shortly and see you tomorrow
Every move I make, every song I wrote
Every planet I go, I will be missing you holy man
Mother left us without saying goodbye holy man
Now you are gone, they say you died standing calling the names of your children holy man
Free, that was millionaire, matire, cap in Baki Lombo
I'm glad you were born Congolese and you die Congolese Katangé
Holy man, holy man, holy man, sure I miss you
They say I never cry for you holy man
God knows everything I did for you
To have a better life before you die, holy man

Madness as result saying goodbye, body man
Now your turn, they say you die
Standing calling the name of your children, holy man

Holy man, holy man, holy man
