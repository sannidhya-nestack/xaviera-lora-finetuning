Red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Intake colors bright and bold
For generations young and old
Intake colors bright and bold
Red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Can't take colors, bright and bold
For generations, young and old
Can't take colors, bright and bold
Sunset kente, red and deep
Soon the children will be asleep
Kente blue, African skies
Lay your head down, close your eyes
Yellow kente, pineapple sweet
So delicious when you eat
Can't take green, the crops are in
Work is over, fun begins
Red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Can't take colors, bright and bold
For generations young and old
Can't take colors, bright and bold
Kente gold for the king
As his royal subjects sing
On his head he wears a crown
Kente colors all around
Kente for the newborn child
For the bride to wear
Can't take colours
Can't take cloth
That which will not tear
Sing, red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Can't take colours
Bright and bold
Four generations young and old
Can't take colors bright and bold
Singing na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can't take colors bright and bold
Red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Kente colors, bright and bold
For generations, young and old
Kente colors, bright and bold
Red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Can't take colors bright and bold
Old generations young and old
Can't take colors bright and bold
Old none, old none, old, old, old
Old, old, old, old, old, old
Can't take colors bright and bold
(Four generations, young and bold)
Can't take colours, bright and bold
Singing in red, blue, yellow, green and gold
Can't take colours, bright and bold
Ocean, red, sun, yellow, you know (Four generations, young and bold)
Can't take colours, bright and bold
