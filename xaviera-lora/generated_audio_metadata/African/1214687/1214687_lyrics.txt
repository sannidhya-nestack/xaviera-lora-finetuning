Yeah, oh, baby, oh
Sitting on the corner, I'm thinking of you, my lady
Oh, I just to think about the love that you give me
Oh my baby, you drive me crazy
I like the way you do me, you do me
I like the love you give me, you give me
I like the way you call my name baby
I like the way you kiss me, you kiss me
I like the way you hold me, you hold me
I like the way you call my name baby
I don't wanna see you frown
I don't wanna see you sad
I just wanna treat you right
I just wanna treat tonight
Girl you are the one for me
Girl you are the one I love
Oh my baby

I'm not the devil, we go one over
My baby knows, she knows
She knows I know the trouble
Come to my place, make me stay over
I'm not the devil, we go one over
My baby knows she knows
She knows I'm on the ground (She loves me, she loves me)
My baby loves me, yeah
She loves me, she loves me
My baby loves me, yeah
She loves me, she loves me

I don't wanna see you frown
I don't wanna see you sad
I just wanna drink your wine

Girl you are the one I love
Oh my baby
