Magical dreams always came true
When I thought there was no fear on me
Had to break through, now I feel like I can call
So many tangled twins, we we
Everyone has something to hide when we first try
To deceive the truth is covered up with lies
You soar right through me every time and let me pass the darkness
A healing power of the mind that led me through
A vision in the quest
The more I know the less I understand
Wings can be your hidden blessings
Things may not happen as we plan
Life's mystery will keep you guessing
Beautiful secrets will unfold
Find your
Inside the mystery
Sometimes we walk tightrope
Uncertainty can be difficult
Remember there's always hope
Untraveled paths bring new results
Do not fear the unknown
Take it from me I embraced
The mystery
You soar right through me every time and let me pass the darkness
A healing power of the mind that led me to a vision quest
The more I know the less I understand
Wings can be your hidden blessings things may not happen as we planned
Life's mystery will keep you guessing beautiful secrets will unfold
Find joy inside the mystery
Embrace the mystery
Life's secrets will unfold
When you embrace the mystery
