Free vibe on it
There's so much hate around
So it's time to show love
Say what you has here
The worst enemy could be your best friend
Best friend could be your worst enemy
Charlie make you show love to your brethren
With love you could live in peace
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
Your best friend could be your worst enemy
Charlie make you show love to your brethren
With love you could live in peace
So let's show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Red rain, make you show love, so let's show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Red rain, make you show love
How do you feel looking on the streets?
Blood flowing, no food to eat
Survivor of the fittest, oldies and daughters
Striving hard before they eat
They got money for war, but not for peace
Kids at home, cause of school fees
Do bedin paya den, na do dibe initi
Ofa wobi nanso kache mesa ajidebi
Odansa meriasa yehun saate muda
Kwa naija kwose, obie kume neba
Cause of dollar city, euro pounds and nara
Medisi kechi apai, mi ni adie neba
Ti asem yee fabi tu koto kum
Wan kasemi wukrum, osiye wukrum
Udi bimami di, bie ene ye de
Show love to your brethren, tanuna yeshe she
Ti asem yee fabi tu koto kum
Wan kasemi wukrum, osiye wukrum
Udi bimami di, bie ene ye de
Show love to your brethren, tanuna yeshe she
Feel it show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Bad rain, make you show love, so let's show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Red ring make you show love
Odo nyami na unu nye tre sen
So my paddy make sure you show love
Oye ma fo frona oye ma me
So my paddy make sure you show love
How you want others do, do unto them
So my paddy make sure you show love
Obepe se ye di blow bowa pam pam
So my paddy make sure you show love
I show love like mighty card
They give me dark bear I show light
I show love so I go high
Na mi chin mun so I make my pass
O mu chen mi sign better mi di can
So you can compare me to the sun
No matter if you hate or not
I'm still gonna shine for you, baby
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
Best friend could be your worst enemy
Charlie make sure love to your brethren
With love we could live in peace
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
Your best friend could be your worst enemy
Charlie make sure love to your brethren
With love we could live in peace
So let's show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Red ring, make you show love
So let's show love
Show love, make you show love, make you show love
Red ring, make you show love
