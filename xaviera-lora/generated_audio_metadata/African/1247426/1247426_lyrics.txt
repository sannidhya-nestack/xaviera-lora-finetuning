Honestly ain't nobody love you like I do
Even if nobody will love you like I do
So come, girl, come, girl, come, girl, along
Call, girl, call, call, girl, along
Call, girl, call, call, girl, along
Come get along, come get along, come get along
Come get along, come get along, come get along
Come get along, come get along, come get along
Come get along, come get along, come get alone
