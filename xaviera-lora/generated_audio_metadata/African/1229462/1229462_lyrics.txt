Turn on the light of your soul
Feel the divine heat in the night
Spirit soaring
Taking flight
We are the children of the earth
We are the children of the sky
We are the ones who heard
The ancient cry
We are the ones who honor
Our roots and wings
We are the ones who sing
The song of our life
Turn on the light of your soul
Feel the divine heat in the night
Spirit soaring
Take in flight
Turn on the light of your soul
Feel the divine heat in the night
Spirit soaring
Take in flight
Oh-eh-oh-oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
Oh we oh oh
We are the spirits of the land and of the sea
We honour our ancestors
Who guide and protect us
On all the cycles of life and death
Bring the balance of the dark and light
Turn on the light of your soul
Feel the divine heat in the night
Spirit soaring, taking flight
Turn on the light of your soul
Feel the divine heat in the night
Spirit soaring, taking flight
Spirit soaring, taking flight
