Fifty-nine crossroad contracts
Twenty-seven demons
I'm still alive
Shielded by a higher power
Protected and guided
Even your hitmen can't touch me
Dead demons running
You wanna swap destiny
You killed my friend
You own have my soul
Yeah, para-ra-ta-ta
For you, I made a promise
I promise you gon' see me reach my highest flight
For you, I keep on fighting
I fight until the Lord decide to take my last breath
I'm on a whole not a level
I put the pieces together
And you don't want no trouble
Trust me you don't want no trouble
Won't you back up off me
I'm not dancing with the devil
I'm not one of them you can hold back
So stop spending money for noob yeah
Jealousy, envy, hate on me and my family
Still me rise to the occasion
Though you send demons to my location
Jealousy, envy, hate on me and my family
You ain't make me so you cannot break me
I'm a mud head of my household
Seriously you think me I go fool
You go and learn from experience
We want problems when I pull out the Uzi
For you I made a promise
I promise you gon see me reach my highest flight
I ain't for you
I keep on fighting
I fight until the lord decide to take my last breath
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm falling
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm falling
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm falling
No way no way
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm falling
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm fallen
Ain't ain't no way in hell I'm falling
Right now right now
