Free vibe on it
A high day movement
Say what you hear
Today is high day, high day
No way call anything, anything
Today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day
Today is high day, high day
No way call anything, anything
Today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
But bite you all the fucking haters
I get the razor, I get the lighter
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
But bite you all the fucking haters
Some call it holiday, we call it high day
No work so you are free, like a weekend so you are free
Cushing all day long, starting from early dawn
Like a rising sun from the east side
Two thousand in the grid, Charlie my fine
Pockets full of ganja
So my high, new Jupiter
It's a high day so Mr. Cop slip
Cruising on the streets in my brand new Jeep
With my paddies, with my ladies
With the family in the day one homies
It's high, it's experiential, today is a high day
So G-1-E-2-2, today is high day, high day
No echo, anything, anything, today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day, today is high day, high day
No echo, anything, anything
Today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day
I get the wings, I get the lighter
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
I'll bite you all the fucking haters
I get the wings, I get the lighter
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
Bye bye to all the fucking haters
Today is high day, high day
No echo, anything, anything
Today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day
Today is high day, high day
No echo, anything, anything
Today is high day, high day
I'm gonna blow all day, all day
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
Bye bye to all the fucking haters
I get the whistle, I get the lighter
I get the weed, I get the paper
So tell me if you wanna party
Bye bye to all the fucking haters
