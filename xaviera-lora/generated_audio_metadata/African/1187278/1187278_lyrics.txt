Ways pull you under
Lies make you wonder
Shouldn't have to fear
Ones you keep near
Ones you lay under
No peace in the mind
There ain't ever enough time
Try to keep behind, mind press rewind
Hard to get over, hard to get over
I see your light's clean, sun shines will make it out the rain
Ay yo, ay yo
On our way home, tears in the night fall
Repeat on the same song
Alone in your soul
No more text
No more phone call
Can't even breathe for a minute
Stress pains like as we're in the winter
Skin rashes on menthol
Incurable Tylenol
You're a fool you can't enter
You can't enter
I see your life's pain
Sunshines won't make it out the rain
Ayo
Yeah, yo, on our way home, on our way home
No more dreams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yo
On our way home, on our way home
You could be lost in your soul until you get through
He's waiting for you, he'll be waiting, yeah, yeah
