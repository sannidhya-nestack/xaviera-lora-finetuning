With every touch of the flame
They feel the same pain
One of deceit
Love and loss
Like the growth of a moss
Waiting for the release
Which hinders the peace
Only seeing
Blind pictures
Upon the wall of their troubled minds
Covering all the detour signs
As if to win
As if to complete
All the patchwork sheets
Waiting for the release
Which hinders the peace
Only seeing, only seeing blind pictures
Covering up the truth which hides
With lies upon this rolling tide
Which comes in upon their shore
And knocks upon their open door
Waiting for the relief
Which hinders the peace
Only seeing, only seeing
Blind pictures
Only seeing, only seeing blind pictures
