Something special's going on here with me and you
We'd be so incredible, ooh you'll feel it too
I like the way you dress, your moves and your mind
Makes me wanna impress on you every time
I'll give you space if you save that place for me right next to you
I'm ready to go so let me know when you're ready too
Something special's going on here with me and you
And we'd be so incredible, ooh, you feel it too
Well, you know and I know as well as every soul here tonight
It's not some secret recipe that's feeding our appetite
Well let's lay low, take it slow
So the fire doesn't get too bright
Then we can keep it burning for more than one night
That's right
something special's going on
Here with me and you
We'd be so incredible
Ooh, you feel it too, yeah
I can see us lying on the beach
And you're shining like the sea
So I dive in deep
You've got someone to tell all your secrets to
Yes you do
We've got so much more to uncover
So please somebody please
Introduce us now
So these visions can finally come true
something special's going on here with me and you
Oh, we'd be so incredible, oh, you feel it too
Oh, something special's going on
Here with me and you
Now, we'd be so incredible
Who you feeling too?
Something special's going on
Here with me and you
Oh, we'd be so incredible
Oh, you feel it too
Yes, you feel it too, something special's a-going on
