You give me that feeling
You give me, give me, give me that feeling
Give me, give me, give me that feeling
I've been found
Picked from the crowd
The game is over
And I'm the winner
No more playing around
No more searching
I'm your person
And you give me, give me that feeling
I've been found
I used to be an elite party of one
Living the dream every night party till dawn
I needed to ditch that scene wash it clean
Everything was fulfilling to routine
When we first met I had to do a double take
Ever since then I've got a feeling I just can't shake
It's an emergency the way my heart is skipping beats
But you can just keep on doing it to me
You give me give me that feeling I've been found
Picked from the crowd
The game is over and I'm the winner
No more searchin' (no more searchin')'cause I'm your person
And you, give me, give me that feelin'
I've been finally finished with all that feelin' lonely business
And seriously, now I'm in this to witness
The reason that I'm ready to begin this
And get into your business, it's obvious
Have you seen you? (Have you seen you?)
Tell me, have you seen you?
You're a home run hottie, no doubt
But it's your brain that really knocks me out, out
When we first met, I had to do a double take
Ever since then, I've got a feeling I just can't shake
It's an emergency, the way my heart is skipping beats
But you can just keep on doing it to me
Yeah, give me, give me that feeling
I've been found, picked from the crowd
The game is over, and I'm the winner
No more playing
No more searching (no more searching)'cause I'm your person and you
Gimme, gimme that feeling I've been found
Picked from the crowd
The game is over and I'm the winner
No more playing around
No more searching (no more searching)'cause I'm your person and you
Give me, give me that feeling I've been
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la-la
That feeling I've been
Fa-la-la-la-la -la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh, the feeling I've been
Fa-la-la-la-la -la
Fa-la-la-la-la -La
No more playing around
No more searching
I'm your person
And you
Give me, give me that feeling I've been
