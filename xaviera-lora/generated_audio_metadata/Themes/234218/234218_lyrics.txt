I didn't know you were married
I never guessed you were a family man
What possessed you to tell me tonight
It's my birthday and I'm crying
I didn't know you were spoken for
In such a serious and legal way
I don't need this complication
It's my birthday, I wanna celebrate
Take me dancing, one last lonely time
Romance me, I'm way past caring
That you're never, ever gonna be mine
Spare me the names of your children
Do they know that dirt is such a cheat?
Get it straight now, you owe me this one
It's my birthday, you said we'd paint the town
I didn't know it was over
I didn't read the signs too well
Can't you take the words right back
It's my birthday
I want you to love me tonight
Love me tonight
Tonight
