We can't fly so far away
We should try, we should try, we should try it again
Don't look back, that's fine
When there's something left behind
When there's something left behind
You can see the dreams ahead
We can lose but let's win instead
I'm old but let's live now
We can't fly so far away
We should try, we should try, we should try it again
Don't look back, that's fine
When there's something left behind
When there's something left behind
You can see the dreams ahead
We can lose but let's win instead
I'm old but let's have the night
We can't fly so far away
We should try, we should try, we should try it again
Don't look back, that's fine
When there's something left behind
When there's something left behind
You can see the dreams ahead
We can lose but let's win instead
I'm old but let's live the night
