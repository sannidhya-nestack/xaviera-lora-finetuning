Why do I resist the light?
Tied to time, trapped in my mind
no one is left to pick up the mess you left
And I'm here all alone
Nobody cares, so why stand in a stare as the world turns to stone?
Why can't I sleep tonight? Why can't I lay in your light?
My freedom falls to pieces
I just wish that you could see the signs
I want to see through your skin
Call a truce, show proof that you win
no one is left to pick up the mess you left
And I'm here all alone
Nobody comes to the end, it's just you and I
Why can't I sleep tonight
Why can't I lay in your light
My freedom falls to pieces
I just wish that you could see the signs
time and time again
I ruined what's not not made to mend
Not made to mend
Oh, oh, oh
The faces are fading slowly away
The places are changing, I stay the same
Erasing, replacing everyday
The faces are fading slowly away
The places are changing I stay the same
I'm hoping I'm praying I can't escape
So why can't I sleep tonight
Why can't I live in your light
My freedom falls to pieces
I just wish that you could see the sign
Why can't I sleep tonight
Why can't I live
Why can't I sleep tonight? Why can't I sleep?
