I don't wanna lose the love we fought so hard to have
There is no doubt in my head
You're the one
You're the one
I love the way I feel when I'm with you
The things you and I do
I love the way you move
I love the way you move me
Love
Hold me, kiss me, get inside my head
Love me, hold me, feel me, get inside of me baby
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I don't wanna choose
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I don't wanna lose you
I'm so into you, I'm so into you
I don't wanna choose
I'm so into you, I'm so into you
I don't wanna lose you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
I'm so in love with you
You're the one
You're the one
I love the way I feel when I'm with you, boo
The things you do
I love the way you move me
I love the way you move me
Love me, hold me, touch me, get inside my head
Love me, hold me, kiss me, get inside of me baby
I'm so into you, I'm so into you
I don't wanna choose
I'm so into you, I'm so into you
I don't wanna lose you
I'm so into you
I'm so into you
I don't want a truth
I'm so into you (I don't wanna lose you)
I'm so into you (I don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose you (I don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose you
