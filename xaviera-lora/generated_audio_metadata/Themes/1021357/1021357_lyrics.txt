I'll be wishin' on the starlight, oh, that it's in me, tongue-tied and threw it out
I'll be wishin' on the starlight day and night, even when not in sight,'cause after all
After wishing on the starlight one night (one night, one night, one night, one night, one night)
You can't even tell whether it's real or not (you can't even tell whether it's real or not)
And now I'm wishing on the starlight (one night, one night, one night, one night)
Night after night wondering if you're even real at all
And now I guess we will see
The truth between you and me
Oh, is this all just a dream?
Have we done it already?
Now I'm wishing on the starlight all night
Living me feeling bright and bright oh
Now I'm wishing on the starlight day and night
Gaining new insight'cause after all
After wishing on the starlight that night
I got to see all of who we are
And now I'm wishing on the starlight side by side
Knowing we're going far
And now I guess we will see
What the future will bring
Oh, this feels so much like a dream
Won't you stay here with me?
'Cause I could wish upon the starlight every night with you
Why was I living so free?
And now wishing on the starlight side by side
You tell me
Before the day we met you did the same thing
Yeah, I guess dream life could be the new reality
