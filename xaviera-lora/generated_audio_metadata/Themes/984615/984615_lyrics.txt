Hey yeah
Like the last car in an empty parking lot
Covered up with snow and the engine wouldn't start
Love broke me down so much it turned me into stone
But you got me up and running and defrosted all my bones
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm already feeling stronger (stronger)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, warm me up a little longer
Oh, there's a heat in your eyes and a fire on your lips
Lightning burning through your fingertips
When you touch me with that electric spark
You jumpstart my frozen heart
When you kiss me we burn up the dark
And you don't stop my frozen heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart
My blood starts running cold and fills me up with doubt
Then you hold me and you heat me up from the inside out
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm already feeling stronger, stronger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, warm me up a little longer, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, there's a heat in your eyes and a fire on your lips
Lightning burning through your fingertips
When you touch me with that electric spark
You jumpstart my frozen heart
When you kiss me we burn up the dark
And you can jumpstart my frozen heart
Don't you know, don't you know that it's touch and go
Need you here, need you here'til I'm in the clear
Heat me up from the inside out
Heat me up from the inside out
There's a heat in your eyes and a fire on your lips
Lightning burning through your fingertips
When you touch me with that electric spark
You jumpstart my frozen heart
When you kiss me we burn up the dark
And you jumpstart my frozen heart
Yeah when you kiss me we burn up the dark
And you don't stop my frozen heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart
You don't stop my frozen heart
