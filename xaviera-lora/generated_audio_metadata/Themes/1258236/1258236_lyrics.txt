I believe in you
And in all you hope to do
I pray that every day
The Lord will guide your way
I believe you're heaven sent
Salt of the earth and different
I believe you're an instrument of grace
I believe in the joy you bring
Like a bird that heralds spring
And I believe in the love seen on your face
I believe in innocence like the sweetness of a child
Who only sees the good and has no guile
And I believe magnificence best describes your soul
A heart of gold I believe the world should know
I believe you're heaven sent Salt of the earth and different
I believe you're an instrument of grace
I believe in the joy you bring
Like a bird that heralds spring
I believe in the love seen on your face
And I believe in innocence
Like the sweetness of a child
Who only sees the good and has no guide
And I believe magnificence best describes your soul
A heart of gold I believe the world should know
A heart of gold I believe the world should know
