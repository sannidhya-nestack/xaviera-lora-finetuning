Hey, how's it going?
I'm happy that I've seen you
I'm happy that I see you too
We got some things to exchange, boo
Boo-oh, boo-oh
I'm all ears for you
So I'm sitting here in your favorite chair
But you never notice me
I'm lying here, my heart out to share
But all you want is freedom from me
Oh, freedom from me
Communicate with my body
Communicate with my mind
Please try to understand me
Let me shine
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do with you
Reaching out for the stars
But all I grab is dust
Thought what we had was love
But with you it's just lust
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more gimme more
Give me more, I need you to hear me
Give me more, I want you to see me
Give me more, take me serious
Don't question my words, always be near me
Give me more, I need your honesty
Give me more, I question your loyalty
Give me more, I need dedication
Show me stuff real, no need for the faking
Sometimes I don't know what you want
You say you mad but I know that's a front
Why you always looking at the negative
Bringing up past things that's not relevant
I know that you done had problems
Petty arguments we need to solve em
I swear bad vibes is what you harbor
Just holding us back from getting farther
You know that I want you in my life
You the lady that turned my wrongs into rights
But it seems when we under hot lights you look for a reason to pick a fight
I don't want that with you I just wanna smile
So you'll have to see me later crocodile
I'll make sacrifices for us to win
Biggest fear losing you as my friend
Reaching out for the stars
But all I grab is dust
Thought what we had was love
But with you it's just lust, lust, lust
Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more
Uh, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more (give me more)
Uh, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more give me more (give me more)
Uh, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more
Reaching out for the stars (reaching out for the stars)
But all I grab is dust (all I grab is dust)
The thought, what we have is love (love)
But with you it's just lust, lust, lust
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more
More
