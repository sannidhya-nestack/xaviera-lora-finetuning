When wildflowers swear it's spring
And every little bird can't help but sing
In my heart you are the song
In my heart you are the song, ooh
You tossed your silver into my well
And made the water sweet where your wishes fell
And in my heart you are the song
In my heart you are the song
For many miles I heard some misty tune
But I could never place it'til I found you
And in my heart you are the song
And in my heart you are the song
You found the berries still bittersweet
And you felt the thorn and it made you bleed
But in my heart you are the song
In my heart you are the song
Forty days, I was lost at sea
But you never gave up on me
In my heart, you are the song
In my heart, you are the song
Ooh
When heaven's road is stretched out before me
I may walk alone but I won't be lonely
in my heart you are the song
In my heart you are the song
Is in my heart
You are
