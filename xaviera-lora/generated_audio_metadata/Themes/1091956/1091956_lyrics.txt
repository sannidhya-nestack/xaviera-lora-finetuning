So lovely you are, so precious to me
A special promise by far for all the world to see
Shine, let our love shine as bright as the sun
Embrace us this day as we become one
There's a light in your eyes I've seen times before
A glow in our hearts so open and pure
As we stand together to start life anew
today is the day when we say "I do"
You're my circle of love, my sparkle of life
A diamond ring for your finger, gonna make you my wife
Standing beside me to have and to hold
As we become one with this circle of gold
I've got two arms to hold you, two hands to share
Two lips to kiss you with warm tender care
Two eyes to see that you have all you need
And one heart to love you for eternity
You're my circle of love, my sparkle of light
A ring for your finger, gonna make you my wife
Standing beside me to have and to hold
As we become one with this circle of gold
Standing beside me to have and to hold
As we become one with this circle of gold
Circle of love, a sparkle of life
A ring for your finger, gonna make you my wife
Standing beside me to have and to hold
As we become one with this circle of gold
With this circle of gold
Circle of love
Sparkle of life
Circle of love
Sparkle of life
Circle of love, sparkle of life
Circle of love, sparkle of life
Circle of love, sparkle of life
Circle of love
