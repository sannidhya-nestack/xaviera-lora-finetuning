Pumpkin pies and laughter rings
Leaves of gold the autumn brings
Family gathered close and tight
Thankful hearts and candlelight
Turkey roasting in the air
Stories told in comfy chairs
Grateful for the love we share
Simple joys beyond compare
Thanksgiving comes once a year
But the love remains right here
Hold each other hold on tight
In our hearts it's always bright
Children playing games of old
Memories like threads of gold
Shared around the table's edge
Stories that we all allege
Pass the gravy down the line
Toast to health with sparkling wine
Cheers to moments big and small
Blessings cherished one and all
Thanksgiving comes once a year
But the love remains right here
Hold each other hold on tight
In our hearts it's always bright
Pass the gravy down the line
Toast to health with sparkling wine
Cheers to moments big and small
Blessings cherished one and all
Thanksgiving comes once a year
But the love remains right here
Hold each other hold on tight
In our hearts it's always bright
Children playing games of old
Memories like threads of gold
Shared around the table's edge
In our hearts it's always bright
Pass the gravy down the line
Toast to health with sparkling wine
Cheers to moments big and small
Blessings cherished one and all
Thanksgiving comes once a year
But the love remains right here
Hold each other hold on tight
In our hearts it's always bright
