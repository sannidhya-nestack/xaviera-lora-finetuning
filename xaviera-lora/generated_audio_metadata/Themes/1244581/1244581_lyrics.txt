This ain't church, but you will get crossed
Ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team get served
This ain't church, but you will get crossed
Ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team get served
Your whole team gets served
Working on my shot you could get this work
Up fight ten and you on my turf
Rep for the city that's on my shirt
Gotta go hard in the paint
I be in the gym working hard for the game
So I can remind you that I'm everything you ain't
They wanna be the champ but they can't take the pain, man
I meditated, I'm dedicated, I envisioned this
I always knew I was the GOAT for sure
But now the world gets to witness it
Arenas packed, fifty thousand fans
So don't ask me what the business is
I only got one goal at hand
And that's protect my home against the visitors
This ain't church
But you will get crossed, ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team gets served
But you will get crossed, ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team gets served
Slayin' these dragons will leave you but hurt like you furloughed a wagon
Number one spot on ya baby I'm bragging
You can't not defend me so you better back it up up
Twice of your sis better curl, cut
Flick of the wrist when I post up
You gotta sit when I'm squirt up
We runnin' them up, what?
This ain't church, but you will get crossed
Ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team gets served
This ain't church, but you will get crossed
Ashes to ashes, put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep, damn I know it hurt
You better play D for your team gets served
This ain't church, cross
Put'em in the dirt, damn I know it hurt
Team gets served (say church)
Put your broken cross
Ashes to ashes
Put'em in the dirt
Six feet deep
Damn I know I hurt it
You better play D for your team gets served
