Woke up this morning, sunshine and bright
Filled with the laughter, everything feels right
Got the world at my feet, no worries in sight
Today's the day, I'm ready to take flight
Every moment treasured, like a precious gem
Friends all around me, we're perfect blend
Dancing through the streets, nothing can offend
This joy we're creating, it'll never end
This is the moment where dreams ignite
It's the best day of my life, I feel so alive
Every heartbeat racing like I'm in a dive
With each passing second I just thrive
This happiness surrounds me like a sweet vibe
Picnics in the park, laughter fills the air
Chasing down the sunset, nothing can compare
With my closest people, there's love everywhere
In this beautiful moment, we et all care
Let's hold on to this feeling forever and bright
It's the best day of my life, I feel so alive
Every heartbeat racing like I'm in a dive
With each passing second I just thrive
This happiness surrounds me like a sweet vibe
It's the best day of my life, I feel so alive
Every heartbeat racing like I'm in a dive
With each passing second I just thrive
This happiness surrounds me like a sweet vibe
The kicks in the park, laughter fills the air
Chasing down the sunset, nothing can compare
With my closest people, there's love everywhere
In this beautiful moment, we et all care
Let's hold on to this feeling forever and bright
It's the best day of my life, I feel so alive
Every heartbeat racing like I'm in a dive
With each passing second I just thrive
This happiness surrounds me like a sweet vibe
Hold on to this feeling
Forever and bright
And very bright
And bright
It's the best day of my life
I feel so alive
Every heartbeat racing like I'm in a dive
With each passing second I just thrive
This happiness surrounds me like a sweet vibe
