Close your eyes now, baby
Rest your head, lie next to me
I will wipe your tears away
The sun
Will bring a brand new day
Go to sleep sweet baby
I will hold you close to me
I will chase your fears away
The sun will bring a brand new day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
