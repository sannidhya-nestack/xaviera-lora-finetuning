They won't eat
Sometimes when it rains reality sets in
And it all comes falling down
Not much here to gain but to acknowledge the truth
Till it all comes falling down
Just tell me it's over cause I don't know
Let me know
'Cause it's the coldest shoulder I'll ever know
I read between the lines
But I can't decipher lies
You said you wanna go
But now you wanna stay
Now you wanna stay
You opened up that door, but won't be on your way, are you still in love with me?
Gotta let it rain on me, I gotta let it rain
Sometimes when it rains, reality sets in
And it all comes falling down
Not much here to gain, but to acknowledge the truth
it all comes falling down
Just tell me it's over'cause I don't know
it's the coldest shoulder I'll ever know
I pray you ive each night
And that you washed away my deeds
All the silent dreaming isn't right, no
I'm already down, why you coming down on me?
You said you wanna go, but now you wanna stay
Now you wanna stay
You opened up the door but won't be on your way Are you still in love with me?
Sometimes when it rains, reality sets in
And it all comes falling down
Not much here to gain, but to acknowledge the truth
Till it all comes falling down
Just tell me it's over, cause I don't know
'Cause it's the coldest shoulder I'll ever know
