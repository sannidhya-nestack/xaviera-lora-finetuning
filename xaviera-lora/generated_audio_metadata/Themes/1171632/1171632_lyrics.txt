Lost along a wooded path
With flowers all around
The moon above is all I have
Hoping to be found
Distant waves on the shore beckon me to come
And sit upon her rocks alone until the night is done
Until the night is done
Now there is a summer song
Begging me to sing
Of peace and calm
And love so strong
That's all I can bring
That's all I can bring
