I think we're getting closer to
The things we said we'd never do
Sometimes days will pass you by
For you've had the chance to shine such a glow
When you're not around such a glow
It's easy to pretend to be a victim of conspiracy
And I don't know, but I've been told
A better man ain't got no soul
Such a bug when you're not around
Such a bug
'Cause I've seen them, all dreams are fading around me
And I've seen them all alone before shut up by
And I've seen them, all wounds are healing inside me
I'm done on feeling small
Things I need are coming through
But not without an hour or two
Mightn't be what they expect
But rather be in my train wreck
Such a bug, and you're not around
Such a bug
'Cause I've seen them fall days a-dawnin' and dyin'
And I've seen them fall from the pits of despair
And I've seen them fall, won't you please come and help them?
I'm keeping walking strong, kicking down the door
I'm walking strong, kicking down this door
I'm walking tall (kicking down the door)
I'm walking tall
I think we're getting closer to the things we said we'd never do
