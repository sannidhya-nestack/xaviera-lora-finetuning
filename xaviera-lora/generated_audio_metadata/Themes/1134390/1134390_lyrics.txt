The sweetest songs are sung by
Lovers in the moonlight
I hear their voices calling from the window
The sky starts yelling, yeah
Have we wasted all this time
Counting every star we crossed
When our hearts were blind
You're a restless heart
You're a shooting star
You're my one and only love
On the downtown train
In what light remains
You're my one and only love
You said to keep going, yeah
You said to never stop
Sometimes I hear voices calling from the wrong end of the block
Away with this doubt and sadness
I know it's hard to conceive
It's good to remember we are only what we believe
You're a restless heart
You're a shooting star
You're my one and only love
On a downtown train
It would like remains
You're the one and only love
Let's not talk of love
Can you look me in the eye
From on top of the Spanish Gate
I watched the raging fire
I put one foot in front of the other
I kept going when I was so tired
I know exactly how we got here
Dear love, you're so kind
You'll always have the key to my heart
And for all time
I can see your better destination
In my heart and my mind
The dreams we had were dreams of you
Someday baby we will learn the truth
This memory's a lullaby
Let us sing for you
You're a restless heart, you're a shooting star
You're my one and only love
On the downtown train, it would like remains
You're my one and only love
You're a restless heart, you're a shooting star
You're my one and only love
