You like to make me guess a lot
You start to speak but then you stop
You're holding more back than the Hoover Dam
You're fine but I wanna know what's on your mind
So don't fight the feeling by keeping it inside
What's in your heart?
Doesn't need to hide
If what you say and what you do ain't feeling like the real you
Don't fight the feeling when the feeling's true
You keep your heart behind barbed wire
I gotta dig a tunnel to crawl inside
I'll do whatever I have to do
So you know I feel just as crazy as you
So don't fight the feeling by keeping it inside
What's in your heart doesn't need to hide
If what you say and what you do ain't feelin' like the real you
Don't fight the feelin', let it break through
You know it's the real thing
So don't fight the feeling
Let it break through
You know it's the real thing
So don't fight the feeling when the feeling's true
Don't fight the feeling by keeping it inside
What's in your heart doesn't need to hide
If what you say and what you do ain't feeling like the real you
Don't fight the feeling
Let it break through
You know it's the real thing
So don't fight the feeling
Let it break through
You know it's the real thing
So don't fight the feeling when the feeling's true
