Why then do we travel there?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The garden walls
Plead to fall
Envy lies
All of life
And God it's old
Breathe too much
We came without a wife
All our tough spin
Caving
Left before we got
I need to cope in pain without a fall
And walk a million miles, I'm living it
I need it all
Smiling, watch the ending roll
A clutch before the throw, I'm giving it
Date, date, date, date, date, date on the ring
The morning ties
With luck aligned they're airing out
Of courage round they're building souls
All alone they're leaving now
Find the time
Peace and play in
Skating pride before we know
I need to call
And leave it all aside, I'm living it, I need it, oh-oh-oh
Really secure the ending road, embrace the seldom go, I'm giving it
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
