Where there is love, you will find comfort
Where there is love, you will find peace
Where there is love from up above
It gives me strength to carry on
Where there is love, I believe
Hope from brighter days
Love from a higher place
Faith when all seems lost in the winds
That's exactly where it begins
Where there is love, you will find comfort
Where there is love, you will find peace
Where there is love from up above
It gives me strength to carry on
Where there is love, I believe
Faith, my saving grace
Hope, to change my ways
Love, when all my fear is setting in
That's where the healing in my soul begins
Where there is love, you will find comfort
Where there is love, you will find peace
Where there is love from up above
It gives me strength to carry on
Where there is love, I believe
There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
