Look what you've done, you're such a mess
Tear out your heart, we'll do the rest
The drops of sweat on your neck contain the ways I can't take one more look at you
I feel the sting
Of every breath you breathe
The nicotine
Chasing away my empathy
Lock up your self respect and fear
What you need is welcome here
Escaped in desire
Deep in the fire of
Desperation on my tongue
You swore I'd be your number one
But I don't want you when I'm done
Last thing I'm looking for is love
I'm trembling by your hips
Feeling good in your lips
The past doesn't exist
Regressed instinct
No time to rethink
Indulgent excess
Fundamentalist progress
The disgust and mistrust pull me back to you
Everything I thought I knew, it all becomes so cruel
But if I get to hate you more, I get what I came here for
Lock up your self respect and fear
What you need is welcome here, steeped in desire
Deep in the fire of
Desperation on my tongue
You swore I'd be your number one
But I don't want you when I'm done
Last thing I'm looking for is love
Ghosts I regret now walk through me
I think I saw you in my dreams
Temptation haunting
You know I'm wanting more
And I've been feeling so uptight
Lost in my thoughts awake at night
I need you to help me rest my mind
Pull the shades in and come to life
Lock up your self respect and fear
What you need is welcome here
Steeped in desire
Deep in the fire, oh
Desperation on my tongue
You swore I'd be your number one
But I don't want you when I'm done
Last thing I'm looking for is love
Last thing I'm looking for is love
Last thing I'm looking for is love
I'm drawn by your hips
Got a gut and your lips
The past doesn't exist
Give me something I'm gonna miss
