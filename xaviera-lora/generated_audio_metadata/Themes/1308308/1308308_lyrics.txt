Oh, woman, you are a mystery
You are a lot of things that a man can never be
Oh, woman, you're a fantasy
A place every man wants to be is next to you
Oh, woman, oh
I would never have been born one day
If it wasn't for a woman
Never would have found my way
If not for a woman
When I was sick she'd pray for me
There's a prayer by a woman
Worked hard and kept feeding me
God blesses a woman
Always would believe in me
There's a faith in a woman
There's a power somewhere within you
There's a strength in a woman
Oh woman
You are a mystery
You are a lot of things that a man can never be
Oh woman
You're a fantasy
A place every man wants to be is next to you
Oh woman
Oh, woman, even when you're on a wrong path
There's a woman that tries to bring you back
A mother, a sister, an aunt, or a wife
You see the best in people
You have a big heart, so big
That's why we need you
Oh, woman, oh woman, oh woman
Oh, woman, oh, woman
Yeah, oh, woman, you are a mystery
You are a lot of things that a man can never be
Oh, woman
You're a fantasy
The place every man wants to be is next to you
Oh one, oh one
I was born by a woman
Was raised by a woman
Were all born from woman
Could have died but a woman
I love me a woman
She might thought she's only human
I love me a woman
I was born by a woman, was raised by a woman
We're all born from woman, could've died but a woman
I love me a woman, she might thought she's only human
I love me a woman
