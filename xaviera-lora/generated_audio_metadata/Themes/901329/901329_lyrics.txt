I was down to my last mistake
Before they were coming to lock me away
And drop the key in the deepest lake
It's in my blood like neon buzzing
And all my edges were getting fuzzy
But I wasn't thinking'bout recovering
No, no, no, no
I never had a reason until there was you
You came and turned my life around
From that dark road I was going down
Surrounded by noise of no good
But you could cut through it
And this fighter's hanging up his gloves
And slowly but surely I'm learning how to love
You, you are my game changer, yeah
You are my game changer, sometimes you catch me
When I'm breathing flames
But none of that nonsense makes you afraid
No, you just cool me like a summer rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And nothing really mattered until there was you
You came and turned my life around
From that dark road I was going down
Surrounded by noise of no good
But you could cut through it
And this fighter's hanging up his gloves
And slowly but surely
I'm learning how to love
You are my game changer, yeah
You
You are my game changer
You know how to bring out the best in me
You see things nobody else can see
And I just wanna be permanently yours
Yeah, I was all out of love for the game
For too long the highs hadn't been the same
And then you came and you
You, you are my game changer, yeah
You, you are my game changer, ooh
