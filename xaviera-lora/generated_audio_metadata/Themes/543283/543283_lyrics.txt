Got books that I don't read
Phone numbers I don't need
Cracks down my window pane
Still keep out the rain
Got music I don't play
Think things that I don't say
Old van and rusted key
Still turns the lock for me
Da da da da, da da da da, da da da da da
Money in my pocket, money in my pocket, money in my pocket
Gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket
Send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit
Don't know how to stop it, don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it, don't know how to stop it anymore
Got things that I don't need
For nothing's I don't need
Got someone you don't need
To keep that in me
Got music that I don't play
Big things that I don't say
Money in my pocket, money in my pocket, money in my pocket
Gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket
Send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit
Don't know how to stop it, don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it anymore
Money in my pocket
Money in my pocket
Money in my pocket
Gonna buy a rocket
Gonna buy a rocket
Gonna buy a rocket
Gonna buy a rocket
Send it into orbit
Send it into orbit
Send it into orbit
Send it into orbit
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it anymore
Teletonic
Satellites on, satellites on, satellites on
Money in my pocket, money in my pocket, money in my pocket
Gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket, gonna buy a rocket
Send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit, send it into orbit
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it
Don't know how to stop it anymore
