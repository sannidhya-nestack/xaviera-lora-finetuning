Just because you tell me that you love me
That should be good enough I guess
Then you tell me what you're thinking of me
And I realize I'm just like all the rest
Just because you tell me that you need me
That should satisfy my longing for the truth
Deep down I know your lies cannot deceive me
I can't help myself I'm too in love with you
One day I'll find the strength to do the things I need to do
But right now my heart can't take being without you
For all I am and all you are and all that we could be
One day I'll find the strength to say I'm ready to be free
Just because you tell me that you want me
That's enough to keep me hanging on
You know I am too weak to be without you
And you know how I would feel if you were gone
I know you'll only keep me if you want to
In your game of love I'm your favorite toy
But be careful just what it is you wish for
You don't understand my sadness brings you joy
One day I'll find the strength to do the things I need to do
But right now my heart can't take being without you
For all I am and all you are and all that we could be
One day I'll find the strength to say I'm ready to be free
Somehow this foolish game excites you
I should turn my back and simply walk away
That I think of my life without you
I guess I'm a fool and that's what makes me stay
For now I'll let you use me like you want to
And pretend you make me happy in your game
But the emptiness I feel when I'm around you
I got no one else but myself to blame
One day I'll find the strength to do the things I need to do
But right now my heart can't take being without you
For all I am and all you are and all that we could be
One day I'll find the strength to say I'm ready to be free
