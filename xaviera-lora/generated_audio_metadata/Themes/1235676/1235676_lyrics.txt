There was this girl that I knew
She took me around the world a time or two
My friends would say, "You must be gone"
I couldn't help myself
I had to play along when it all went wrong
When that old world still tries to bring me down
I keep on smiling, I keep on trying
'Cause this new world shows no signs of slowing down
So I keep on finding
Another reason to keep on grinding
I took a job to get me through
I was told that's what you're supposed to do
So many days I wanted to run
I found myself in the center of a blazing sun
And it was no fun
When that old world still tries to bring me down
I keep on smiling, I keep on trying
this new world shows no signs of slowing down
So I keep on finding
Another reason to keep on grinding
Keep on keepin' on, keep on keepin' on
Keep on keepin' on, keep on grindin'
Keep on keepin' on, keep on keepIN' on
Keep on keepin' on, keep on grindIN'
Or you could say I'm not done yet
Who hasn't lived a life with some regrets
But there are people and places left to see
And that's what keeps the past from getting the best of me
And I feel free
That old world still tries to bring me down
I keep on smiling
I keep on trying
this new world shows no signs of slowing down
So I keep on finding
Another reason to keep on grinding
Yeah, mmm
But that old world still tries to bring me down
I keep on smiling, I keep on trying
this new world shows no signs of slowing down
So I keep on finding another reason to keep on grinding
Keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
Keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on
I keep on keepin' on, I keep on keepin' on
