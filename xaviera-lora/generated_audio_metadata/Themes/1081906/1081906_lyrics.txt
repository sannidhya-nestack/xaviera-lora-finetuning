Came up from old money, never worked a day in his life
Handshakes and backroom deals, no one he couldn't buy
Black suit with red, white and blue pinned above his heart
When it came election time, he knew how to play the part
Standing on that platform, right hand raised up high
Repeating back that solemn oath, made it sound just right
Little white lies on a black leather Bible
Secrets taken down to the grave
They said, "So help me God" and the devil smiled
Little white lies on a black leather Bible
She fell for that polished grin and that kindle slicked back hair
Sweet things he would whisper to her when no one else was there
Two weeks till the wedding day she caught him sneaking around
Instead of calling it off she decided to take him down
Standing at the altar in her mama's veiling gown
Took that diamond on her left hand and spoke those sacred vows
Little white lies on a black leather bible
Secrets taken down to the grave
She said "I do" and the devil smiled
Little white lies on a black leather bible
One shot fired inside the mansion
Police called it suicide
His poor wife was upstairs sleeping
At least that's what she testified
Little white lies on a black leather bible
Secrets taken down to the grave
The preacher said the good lord welcomes his faithful child
Little white lies on a black leather Bible
