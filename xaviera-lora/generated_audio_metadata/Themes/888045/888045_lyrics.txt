Anything can happen to the young at heart, young at heart
That's why we keep racing, trying to beat the clock, beat the clock
Playing with fire, one match at a time
Light it up and watch the night shine
When it's all over but the shouting
I said we had a blast
We came, we saw, we kicked it (as you were saying)
Shake, shake, shake the world
Shake, shake, shake the world
Shake, shake, shake the world
Shake, shake
