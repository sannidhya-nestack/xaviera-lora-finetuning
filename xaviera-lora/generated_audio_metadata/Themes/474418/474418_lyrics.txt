Time really does fly
Seems like just yesterday you were so small
And look at you now
Ready to conquer the world
Couple of things before you get started
About where you come from
And where you're going
Every prayer
Your mom and I prayed has brought you to this place
It's been you and me and your family and God holding your hand
And the world can be so deceiving on the surface
Life looks so easy, trust me on this
Stay true to your dreams
'Cause I'll lead you to a path
Where your feet will know the way
How and everything will feel right
Walk straight
Oh and run the moment you feel
The goodness start to fade
Back to your dreams
Back to your dreams
They mean everything are your dreams
You're gonna be pulled so many different ways
You got plenty of time so just breathe
Tomorrow will come
Living like you know how
On the sun about real love
That always feels right
Every prayer
Your mom and I've prayed has brought you to this place
It's been you and me
And your family and God
Holding your hand
And the world can be so deceiving
On the surface life looks so easy
Trust me on this
Stay true to your dreams
Cause it'll lead you to a path
Where your feet will know the way
How and everything will feel right
Walk straight
On run the moment you feel
The goodness start to fade
Back to your dreams
Back to your dreams
Oh they mean everything
Your
Do what makes you happy, laugh just like you breathe
Don't hold your heart back ever, don't wear it on your sleeve
Every prayer your mom and I prayed has brought you to this place
It's been you and me and your family and God holding your hand
And the world can be so deceiving
On the surface life looks so easy
Trust me on this
Stay true to your dreams
True to your dreams
Because they mean everything
Your dreams
