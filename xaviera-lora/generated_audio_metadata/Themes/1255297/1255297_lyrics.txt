Sunday morning when I wake up
You're not there
I don't know what to do so
I just stare
At the ceiling watch the fan go
Round and round
Just let last night slowly sink in and pound
Oh, she threw her hands up in despair
She threw her hands up
This ain't love, you just take advantage of my sympathy
This ain't love, you just take advantage of my sympathy
Hearing dishes being thrown into the sink
Empty bottles break'cause gravity always wins
I would move but I think I'd, I'd just fall
By the bed where we would make love in times of old
Oh, she threw her hands up in despair
She threw her hands up
This ain't love
You just take advantage of my sympathy
This ain't love
You just take advantage of my sympathy
Oh
She threw her hands up in despair
She threw her hands up in despair
She threw her hands up in despair
She threw her hands up (hands up)
This ain't love, you just take advantage of my sympathy
This ain't love, you just taking advantage of my sympathy
My sympathy, my sympathy, my sympathy, my sympathy, my sympathy
My sympathy, my sympathy, my sympathy
This ain't love, you just take advantage of my sympathy
