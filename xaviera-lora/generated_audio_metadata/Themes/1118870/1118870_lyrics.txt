Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Breaking up, going back again
We know it's wrong but we do what we can
To fix what we had
When did it all become so bad?
Is this love or something else?
I just can't figure out myself
Maybe it's time for us to move on
But we can't let go, we can't be strong
Let me go, let me go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Breaking up, going back again
We know it's wrong, but we do what we can
To fix what we have
When did it all become so bad?
Is this love or something else?
I just can't figure out myself
Maybe it's time for us to move on
But we can't let go, we can't be strong
Let me go, let me go
Breaking up going back again
We know it's wrong but we do what we can
To fix what we had
When did it all become so bad
Is this love or something else
I just can't figure out myself
Maybe it's time for us to move on
But we can't let go we can't be strong
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go, let me go
