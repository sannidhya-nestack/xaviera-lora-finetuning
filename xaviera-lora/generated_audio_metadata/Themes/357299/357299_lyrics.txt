We know this guy from Oregon
A kind of hard to understand
Most of us just sit around here and
Watch him wander off into wonderland
Deja vu to the city
He'll go off by himself
It doesn't matter to mention leaving, no
Soon to be trial, I leave, leave, leave
Three, three, three, three, three
Why don't you lay off for a while?
Three, three, three, three, three
Who does that?
Ancient myth of Odysseus
Out comes a string of furies
Midnight walks to the play park
Inhaling combs after combs and
Their evaporation
Holds a tranquil peace
Oh, just like those little days your piercing to provide a level release
Three, three, three, three, three
Why don't you lay off for a while?
Three, three, three, three, three
Who does that? No
Who does that? No
Who does that? No
Who does that? No
Oh three, still can't seem
To find yourself amidst the same old scene
Did you ever stop and think
Maybe it was more than you
As to why yourself, you
Three three three three three
Why don't you lay off for a while
Three, three, three, three, three
Who does that?
Oh, who does that?
Three, three, three, three, three
Why don't you lay off for a while?
Three, three, three, three, three
Who does that? No, who does this? No, who does this? Who does this? Who does this? Who does this
Who does that? Who does that?
