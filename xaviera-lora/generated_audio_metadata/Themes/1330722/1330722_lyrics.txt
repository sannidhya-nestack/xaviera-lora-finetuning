Ooh, ooh
Church people are not hypocrites
No simpletons, dopes or sophisticates
At their best they follow the rules they create
Surely they know to love and to hate
Project your fears on true believers
Take your meds, immunity from fever
Houses of worship got good intention
Doctrines and beliefs are man made invention
They's not your children to ask
Like they're better
The gospel's composed of
Four honest letters
Unfortunately for us
There's no time to read them
No life ever lasting for singing a hymn
Pointing fingers at sinners
A thing for beginners
Hard to deny grapes and grains
The shame of betrayal drinking wine at dinner
Raise not your children to act like they're better
The gospel's composed of four honest letters
And fortunately for us there's no time to read them
No life everlasting for singing a hymn
Sitting under a tree to get enlightened
True unbelief leaves believers frightened
On earth the most sacred call
Like Adam and Eve
We're destined to fall
Raise not your children to act like they're better
The gospel's composed of four honest letters
Unfortunately for us there's no time to read them
No life ever lasted for sin
The road to glory detours at the chapel
Evictions for pay and Adam's apple
