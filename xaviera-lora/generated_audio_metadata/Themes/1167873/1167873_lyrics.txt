Shit! Fuck! Here!
I came a long way, down a long road
Dozen hearts rain, looking for the crossroads
It's a global shit, under the gospel
It's the arithmetic of the apostles
It's the weirdest shit you've ever witnessed
Propaganda forced on your radios
Stereos, headphones and speaker sets
This ain't real right yet, this is the big test
What's next on the road to redemption?
With freedom did I mention
Hit me at the last recession
Dance with the devil in the past dimension
Perplexed and straight, mind boggling
Smoking more trees than Bob Marley
I'm feeling 2001 at hearty
Space Odyssey, I'm just waiting on the obelisk
Transformers, get cold shoulders please
I'm sure don't pull me over
I have drugs in my system and listen
I don't wanna spend another night in prison
One time for the radio disco
Two times can you feel it in the air
Two times when you feel like Cisco
One time for the people who cares
One time for the radio disco king and queen
One time for the radio, disco king and queen
I feel like Donnie Darko, I got the gas like Arco
Snortin' coke like Narcos, I keep it clean like Barso
Had a dream like Martin, I gave them bars like Lawson
Now all these labels on my line, I don't need all your offers
I need round of applauses, and thousand dollar horses
I've won a couple warships, and models whippin' Porsches
I never graduated but they still call me a scholar
I would give away my story just to make a couple dollars
If I'm paid then I'm getting paid I don't see no shade
If I'm paid then I'm getting paid I don't see no shade
I never graduated but they still call me a scholar
I would give away my story just to make a couple dollars
One time for the radio disco king and queen
One time, one time for the radio disco king and queen
One time
