La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Glasses clink, laughter in the air
Friends are singing, nothing can compare
Firelight flickers, smiles all around
2076 is here
Let the joy resound
All together!
Happy New Year! (Yee-haw!)
Sing it loud, dance, hooray! (Happy!)
Happy New Year! (Woo-hoo!)
Crazy night for me and you!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Bells are ringing, voices shout and cheer
Stories, jokes, and endless festive beer
Hands held high, everyone is near
2020's sweet, the best time of the year
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year! Echo through the night
Laughter bouncing under candlelight
Raise your voice, make the spirits bright
Sing, dance, celebrate until daylight
Happy New Year, yeah
Sing it loud, dance, hooray, yeah, hooray
Happy New Year, whoo
Crazy night for me and you
Happy New Year, yeah
Sing it loud, dance, hooray, yeah
Happy New Year, whoo
Crazy night for me and you
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Happy New Year, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sing it loud, dance, hooray!
