I am less aware of the danger everywhere
Help when you pull me in
And hold my skin and I can rest my head
And a path where this has led
Carefully winding shore
Has made me more alive
Tell me a story where life will never stop
And the ticking of the clock is not a symptom to us planning
'Cause when the waters are high
And hope is darkest of night
You've grown your life, life
And trust in time, time
And when the rain is bad
You bring us all back
Not worried why or how
I'm feeling better now
I am less concerned with the bridges that I've burned under me
Now that we have come to be
I am less impaired by the shadows that once scared and baffled me
You tell me a story where life will never stop
And the ticking of the clock is not a symptom to us planning our last day
when the water's high and hope is dark as night
You throw your lifeline and just in time
And when the rain is down
You bring the sun down
Not worried why or how
I'm feeling better now
Ah, ah, ah, ah
'Cause when the anchor holds
We'll hum our last song
You throw your life line
And just in time, time
And when the rain is bad
And I have all I can have
Not worried why or how
I'm feeling better now
