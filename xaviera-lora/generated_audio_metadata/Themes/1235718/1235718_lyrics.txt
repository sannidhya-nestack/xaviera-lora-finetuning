No one tells'em so nobody lies
No one knows the tears that I've cried
They don't wanna see so you make'em believe
No one's right but they all disagree
Broken hearts are along for the ride
They all know they're crossin' their eyes
Hey Big Joe won't you take'em down slow
Once you know when your soul has been sold
Dizzy chains around my brain
My thoughts remain unchanged
Maybe Jane, Ferris Bane, it's all the same
Albatross, but I had to move on
I ripped and tore until it was gone
Maybe I'm doomed with the fire red moon
Or left the womb just a little too soon
River Cain runs through my veins, it's time to kill the pain
Baby Jane, fairest feign, it's all I'll say
Everyone knows it, everyone sees it
Under my skin lies no uncertainty
All I wanna do is curse the walls around me
I'd wish for a change if I only had three
Daisy Jane wrapped'round my brain
But I've taken all the blame
Lady Jane, fair as feign, it's all the same
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's all I'm saying
