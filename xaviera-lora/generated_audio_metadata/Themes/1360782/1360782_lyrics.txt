Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Raise your hands, let the angels play
Sing and dance, joy lights the way
Should've joined laughing streets alive
If you're still lifting spirits thrive
It's Christmas time
The world's aglow
Merry Christmas
Let your heart show
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Joy and love in every heart
Celebrate the magic, play your part
Oh, season's bright (season's bright)
Feel the love, share the light (share the light)
Joy is near, feel the love, the season's right
Snowflakes fall, the night's so bright
Candles glow, hearts feel light
Voices rising, angels sing
Celebrate the hope this season brings
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, it's Christmastime
Merry Christmas, it's Christmastime
Merry Christmas, it's Christmastime
It's Christmastime, merry Christmas
Joy and love in every heart
Celebrate the magic, pray your prize Oh, the season's bright
Feel the love, share the light
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Let your voices ring in rhyme
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas, it's Christmas time
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)
It's Christmas time (It's Christmas time)
Dance and sing (Dance and sing)
The world's awake
Celebrate the joy that Christmas makes
