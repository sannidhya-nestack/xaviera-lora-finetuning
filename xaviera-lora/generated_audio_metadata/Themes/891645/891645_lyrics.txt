Stop shutting down my love
What you afraid of? You're overthinking it too much, too long
My kiss should have said it all
It's okay to fall in love with me
I'm what you need and that's a feeling you can trust
So just stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Tell me I'm the one who makes you want to come
Running home every night
I see you and me, building a family
Can you picture this life?
Holding you close, so comfortable
Baby, let go of all your doubts
After all we've been through
I know it's you, so now
It's time to call you out
Stop shutting down my love
Watch you afraid of your own
For thinking it too much, too long
My kiss should've set it off
It's okay to fall in love with me
And what you need, that's a feeling you can trust
So just stop shutting down my love
Stop shutting down my love, yeah
Shutting down my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Last time you gave your heart
You watched it fall apart
Down with it in your quiet ways
I'd like to
Crash my wrecking ball
Into your six foot wall
Show you a better way to break
Nothing's too big for love to fix
Let's work on it or walk away
One way could be the way I see it
You got an easy choice to make
Stop shutting down my love
What you afraid of your own
But thinking it too much too long
My kiss should've said it all
It's okay to fall in love with me
I'm what you need and that's a feeling you can trust
So just stop
Chanel, my love
Some Chanel, my love, yeah
Chanel, my love
So stop shutting down my love
Stop shutting down my love
Shutting down my love
