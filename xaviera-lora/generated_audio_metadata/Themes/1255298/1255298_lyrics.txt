Like a feather it fell to earth
A boy with no plan
Holding on for dear life
To his mother's hand
The sun was bright but the clouds were black
Hanging over him
Scared to move but numb with fear
Of where to begin
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you out of the blue
Drink and fight and getting stoned
Hiding in the park
Infatuated by the pain
And the valley lights
He took it to the brink
It was all over you
As the cuts split on his arms
You came out of the blue
Someone like you (Someone like you)
Someone like you (Someone like you)
Someone like you out of the blue
Someone like you, someone like you, someone like you, someone like you
Someone like you out of the blue
Someone like you
And all the while I wonder
If I'd still be here today
If I didn't take my chance with you
Kept on running like a hopeless fool
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you out of the blue
Someone like you (Someone like you)
Someone like you (Someone like you)
Someone like you out of the blue
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you
