There's no censoring my heart
I can't pretend to be what I'm not
I will feel just the way I feel
Every part of me is here
I'm right here with you
I'm right here with you
Right here with you
I'm right here with you
It's hard to hold back the truth of me
That sings out to you
These simple moments are so complete
Now that all of my heart is here
There's no censoring my heart
I can't pretend to be what I'm not
I will feel just the way I feel
Every part of me is here
I'm right here with you
I'm right here with you
Right here with you
I'm right here with you
Our tears don't always have to be defined
Sometimes they're not yours or mine
When it comes down to how we deeply feel inside
All the noise just passes by
No need for stressing or trying to make it right
This radiance is enough
I'm staying present and aware of all that strengthens this sweet bond of love
There's no censoring my heart
I can't pretend to be what I'm not
I will feel just the way I feel
Every part of me is here
I'm ready
I'm right here with you
I'm right here with you
Right here with you
I'm right here with you
Aware and awake
All of myself is here to stay
And I'm giving my all
As everything else just falls away
I'm right here with you
I'm right here with you
Right here with you
I'm right here with you
