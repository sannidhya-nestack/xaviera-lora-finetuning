I've been a Wild Rover for many's a year
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer
And now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no name ever
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play in Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And that old landlady, my money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay"
Saying, "Custom as yours, I can get any day"
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the Wild Rover?
No, never, no more
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said I have whiskeys and wines of the best
And the words that I told you were only in jest
And it's no nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
I'll go home to my parents
Confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they have kissed me as of times before
I never will play the Wild Rover no more
And it's no nay never
No, nay, never, no more
Well, I played a while over
No, never, no more
And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Well, I played a while over
No, never, no more
