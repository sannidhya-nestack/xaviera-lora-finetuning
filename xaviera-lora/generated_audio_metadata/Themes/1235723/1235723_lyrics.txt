Can't you see, can't you see that they burn me
Can't you see, they do not concern me
I'm stuck up here in limbo
I'm gonna twist my way out
I'm running round in circles
And I'm chasing my doubts
Oh, so broken and alone
Yeah, the lights are overblown
But I'll be
Be as one beyond the sea and the sun
And they'll see who we've become because the damage is done
Can't you see, can't you see that they hate me
And they'll try, try to overrate me
I'm stuck in here forever
Try to find my way out
And climb out from this drama
I'm violated again
Yeah, I never was your friend
The B has won beyond the sea and the sun
And they'll see who we've become because the damage is done
But it seems, it seems all wrong and now there's nowhere to run
And they'll sink right through the scum outgunned the million to none
Free, breathe, see
Right through the sun and bleed
We, we'll see who's won
It is the season, warm and easy
A special springtime every day
The innocence is all around me
And like a breeze it floats away
No aspiration or solution
The passion deep in disarray
And was it love or prostitution
The stigma now is here to stay
No turning back now, new beginning
There's no time to realize
That next to you, I'm next to nothing
And all imagination dies
But desperation or confusion
Don't look around, just turn the page
Intoxication for a moment
Then it's all explained away
It is the season, warm and easy
A special springtime every day
The innocence is all around me
Like a dream it floats away
