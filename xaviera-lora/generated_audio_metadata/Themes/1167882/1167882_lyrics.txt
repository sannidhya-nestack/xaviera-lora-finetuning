Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you
Will you love me through it all?
I will love you through it all
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you
Will you walk with me?
I will walk with you
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you
Will you rise with me?
I will rise with you
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you when you fall
I will hear you
I will hear you when you call
I will heal you
Will you heal me after all?
Will you rest in me?
I will rest in you
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you
Will you trust in me?
I will trust in you
Will you catch me when I fall?
I will catch you when you fall
I will hear you, I will hear you when you call
I will heal you, will you heal me after all?
Like falcons entwined in the sky
We fall and we fall from up high
And then we love and we love and we love
Until we die
Will you wait for me? I will wait for you
Will you catch me when I fall? I will catch you
Will you love me through it all? I will love you through it all
Will you catch me when I fall? I will catch you when you fall
Will you catch me when I fall? I will catch you when you fall
