Why do you still look at me like
I should be the chosen one
No one asked me what I think
But now I've learned
I'll be burned
Nobody pay my dues
For every breath I take
There's always someone looking at me
I'm not afraid, I just want a great treat
I'm not a god, a king of fools
I am not claiming to tell you
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to live
I'm not supposed to win the war
I am just coming back to wait for more
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to live
I've got the right to remain silent
And make all my mistakes
I don't owe you anything
For every breath I take
There's always someone looking at me
I'm not afraid, I just wanna break free
I'm not a god, a king of fools
I am not claiming to tell you what to do
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to leave
I'm not supposed to win the war
I am just coming back to wait for more
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to leave
I'm not a god, a king of fools
I am not claiming to tell you what to do
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to leave
I'm not supposed to win the war
I am just coming back to wait for more
I'm just a man who knows where he's been
I'm just a man who was given to leave
I'm not supposed to win the war
I'm just a man who was given to live, given to live
