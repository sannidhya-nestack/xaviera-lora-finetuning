Yeah, ah, check this
All Africans everywhere
Open up your mind, open up your ears
I got a little something to say to you
And it's not gonna make you feel any good
How long shall we remain in this delusion
Trying to borrow our way out of economic depression
Man, it's just an illusion
A revolving door of absolute confusion
From generation to generation
Ever since the end of the first colonization
We've been in the same situation
Experiencing the same degradation
And there's absolutely nothing on the horizon
To suggest any hope for emancipation
And that right there is the ban of my aggravation
So I gotta ask you this question
Africa, Awamumu never doomed
Hey Africa, Awamumu never doomed
Hey Africa, Awamumu never doomed
Hey Africa, Awamumu never doomed
From slavery to colonialism
From colonialism to neo-colonialism
From neo-colonialism to chino-nialism
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
Our forefathers rejected colonialism
But we turned around and embraced neocolonialism
And now we're setting up our children for chino-nialism
And this to me is the ultimate mumuism
We keep on compromising our integrity
We keep on abdicating on our responsibilities
We keep on destroying our respectability
By resorting to borrowing and panhandling
That's when we're borrowed and we cannot pay back
Due to the atrocities of our corrupt leaders
We end up ten steps at the bottom of the ladder
And to them it doesn't even matter
This is the state of Africa today
Greedy people in power in for their own gain
Selling unnatural resources away
Plunging the continent in disarray
Africa, Awamumu never do
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
From slavery to colonialism
From colonialism to neo-colonialism
From neo-colonialism to chino-nialism
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
Hey Africa, Awamumu never do
He don't do war
