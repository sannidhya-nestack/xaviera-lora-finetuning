These days we're living the best we can just scraping
To get by eye to eye not like the past times
Just sitting here asking God why
We have to suffer to make things better let it go on any longer
I just want the best
I just want the best for my life
So here everyday
I hear talk of hate
I see history battling it out today
I wish it would all just go away
Let it go they say
Because we are the children
Mother earth can you listen
Divided all nations
Come together come come come together yeah
We are the people we are the people
Here's the church here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
She loves her, he loves him
Why not just let the love in
Waiting for the judgement to come to an end
Everyone with their view of how it all began
Why is it so hard to just be friends
Families arguing until the bitter ends
Until the bitter ends
But I hold tight, wanna make things right
Had the feeling it's gonna take all my might
Hope it's possible to win this fight, I'm gonna try
Be the best person I know I can be
Walk around with my heart on my sleeve
Take advantage of the soft soul that you see
It's okay I believe
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good and out the evil
We the people be the prequel to the needed change
It be too lethal we too regal we won't let the evil reign
Relieve in pain by seeking love reach the same
Release the grudge free to change
We don't judge we all can win I believe in us
So let's all join forces and stop scoring in choices
And unite and start rejoicing take a listen to the smallest voices
Toxic poisons being spilled upon our city streets
Physically and mentally so listen to my figured speech
Let's live in peace reach our hands so we afflict the weak
Liquors cheap but we won't fix these issues by just sipping drinks
Didn't think to drain the poison down the kitchen sink
Wish we did the things that I've been saying when I'm ripping beats
I sit and breathe contemplating how to grip the key
To free our minds from hatred that'll be our biggest victory
Open up my eyes and everybody that I see is equal
Let's fight for what is right now, homie, we the people
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
We are the people, we are the people
Here's the church, here's the steeple
The synagogue and the feeble
Let's push in the good, out the evil
