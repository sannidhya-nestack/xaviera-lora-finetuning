We've got to figure it, somehow just figure it out like
We've got to figure it, somehow just figure it out, figure it out like
We've got to figure it, somehow just like
We've got to figure it, somehow just figure It
It's been a little over seven days since the last time I felt alive
You know I'm such a fool when it comes to you
My my, I think I'm going a little bit crazy
I never thought that I would fall in love
I never thought that it would be like this
But the first time that we kissed
Left a lasting memory on my lips
I never thought that I would fall in love
I never thought that it would be like this
But the first time that we kissed
Left a lasting memory on my lips
I need your love, be your love, be your love
I need your love, be your love, be your love
I need your love, be your love, be your love
You've got to figure it out, somehow just figure it out
I need your love, be your love, be your love
All I wanna do is be with you
All I ever needed was to have you
You've always been the one to steal my heart
All I wanna do is be with you
All I ever needed was to have you
You've always been the one to steal my heart
I need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love
I need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love
So sweet, so good, it's getting high
The feeling that you make me come alive inside
My heart is racing and I'm getting high
Thinking about you makes me call my life inside
Call my life inside
We've got to figure it
Somehow just figure it out
We've got to figure it
Somehow just figure it out
We've got to figure it
Somehow just figure it out
We've got to figure it
Somehow just figure it out, figure it out
And we've got to figure it, somehow just make
We've got to figure it, somehow just figure it, figure it out
I need your love, be your love, be your love
We've got to figure it, somehow just figure it out, figure it out
I need your love, be your love, be your love
We've got to figure it, somehow just figure it
