We get caught in emotion
While we're already open
Said we were just friends
This is deep like the ocean
If we don't take precautions
We could go to nowhere
Oh, and I don't wanna lose you baby
I know that you're missing me
You be talking so filthy, gon' keep up that energy
I'm so double minded
One minute I went platonic, the next I'm behind it all
And I don't think this is fair
No, I don't think this is fair
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers, yeah
Friends and lovers
We get caught in emotion
Hoping and hoping
That we could be more than friends, baby
But the ones we're involved with
Shit could evolve quick
And it could go to nothing, oh
Oh, and I don't wanna lose you, baby
I know that you're missing me
You be talking so filthy, don't keep up that energy
I'm so double-minded
One minute I'm one platonic, the next I'm behind it
And I don't think this is fair
No, I don't think this is fair
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
Fear is the love of us
And I don't think this is fair
No, I don't think this is fair
And I don't think this is fair
No, I don't think this is fair
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
Friends and lovers
