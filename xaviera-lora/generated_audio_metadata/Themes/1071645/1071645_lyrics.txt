Mysterious virus, it came out of nowhere
Shocking all the nation, leaving all us so scared
Sickness in the air, invisible disguises
It changed our lives, but will it shape our lives?
It seemed like the flu, but way more deadly
We were not prepared for this, no we were not ready
Is it an apocalypse? How can we stop all this?
How can we conquer this?
Gotta stay on top of this
In the pandemic you don't know how to act
You're not thinking clearly and that is just a fact
How long will it last cause it's just too much
Enough is enough, we can't even touch
Is there a cure for us all, I don't know
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all, I don’t know, I don’t know
Hitting us harder, way harder than a boulder
Everyone's on lockdown just getting older
This a nightmare I wish it was over
This a nightmare I wish it was over
I remember when life was so much better
We were in the sun enjoying all the weather
Social distancing I never even heard of it
Now it's day to day really how absurd is this
Wanna see my friends I wanna see my family
Wanna go to work not dealing with this agony
Lockdowns continue on high alert
If they find a vaccine will it even work
Is there a cure for us all, I don't know
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all, I don’t know, I don’t know
COVID-19, is it just a bad dream
If it was a movie, it would be the sad scene
I’m up late at night, drinking some caffeine
I pray one day that we will find a vaccine
Self isolation got me feeling lonely
Just me myself and I don't want it lonely
I wanna go to town but it's just it's a ghost town
In my memory lane I can't even stroll down
Keep it real never felt anything as real as this
Wonder how much longer we will have to deal with this
Will it be a thing of the past or future
Until we find a cure it spreads like a rumor
Is there a cure for us all, I don't know
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all, I don’t know, I don’t know
Is there a cure for us all, I don’t know
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all, I don ’t know
It's a strange world we live in
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all? (la la la)
It's a strange world we live in
It's a strange world we live in
It's a strange world we live in
Is there a cure for us all? (la la la)
