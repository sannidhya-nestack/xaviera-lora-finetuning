Don't sore stroke me brother with all your lies
Payin' me tomorrow ain't gonna fly
All I want from you is cold hard cash
Cold hard cash
All I want from you is cold hard cash
Don't make me no promises
You can't keep
Don't fill up my phone with apps I don't need
All I want from you is cold hard cash
Cold hard cash
All I want from you is coal, tar, cash.
You want my old pickup and the rifle on the rack
Well go stand in line at the back of the bank
all I want from you is cold hard cash
Cold hard cash
All I want from you
Is cold hard cash
All I want from you
It's cold hard cash
