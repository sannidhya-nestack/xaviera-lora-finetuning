Has your life turned out the way
You thought that it would be
Or have the prophets of doom made you believe
That it's best to keep the world at bay
No feelings are in free
There's a price to pay for loving too deep
The hurt is there, it covers your soul
The hurt is there and I can see
The reasons why you feel the way you do
But life has passed you by
The time is now to believe
That happiness is sometimes free
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into my light
Oh, when ancient sorrow buries your joy
You're frozen in your tracks
You've lost your nerve and feel you can't go back
Just grab the wind and don't let go
Close your eyes and take that leap
A brave new world is waiting at your feet
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into my light
Sometimes I don't know why
I feel the way I do about you
Your fear it draws me in, won't let me be
And then I look into your eyes
And see your shining heart
Then I realize I'm you and you are me
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into my light
Only you know the way to my heart
Only you know the way
Only I know the way to your heart
Only I know the way
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into the light
Come out of the darkness and into my light
