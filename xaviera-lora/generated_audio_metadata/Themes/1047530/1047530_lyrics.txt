The avalanche can feel your broken heart
To make it stop remember that we were gone together
Another day can put you where you start
Forever makes it easy to find the place where I'll be
Imagination fights the biggest wave
I'm at a place where I can rest it all and not release them
A balance here can manage what I saved
We will enjoy the future help denied with what to shoot for
Guilty
He stole things while shot to death
And I can't release myself from where it happened
Empty highlands buried islands
Assassination show me holly
Separate times and other minds have always been a lot for sharing
You're pulling punches on the night I'd hate
A bandage makes it over
We're also getting older
There's enough magic here to hurt this man
We haven't set the grounds yet
The timing's right to make it
A billion years and I can see the pain
Night hasn't made the way through
But I can tell you
My own commotion strikes the world as tape
Truth told I'm swimming in it
Cannot find where I committed
Call the pain, oh
The harder getting in every window
Clouds start waving
Candy eyes to break the silence
Out of mission still we carry
Heavy eyelids pray for mileage
All this movement stationary
Now I'll be okay in the morning
Empty highlands, buried islands
Fascination, show me Holly
Separate times and other minds have
Always been a lot for sharing
