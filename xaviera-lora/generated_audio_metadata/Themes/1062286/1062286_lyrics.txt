All I do is work, all I do is work, all I do is work
I be stacking cash money, I be ripping work
Fucking with my bag, put picture on the shirt
All I do is work
All I do is work, all I do is work
I'm talkin' safety stakes, we gonna get that cake
I'm talkin' whole things, watch them down upon the plate
All I do is work, nigga I'm movin' that work
Try to rob me for my cash, put a nigga in the hearse
Put a nigga on the search, get a whole lot of merch
I be whippin' up the yams, everyday like the first
I be countin' up the bands
Cookin' that bag in the brand
I do not fuck with the Xans
I'm poppin' beans, blowin' gas
It's on me nigga, fuckin' stash
I put some hot up in your ass
Everyday I'm with the guys
We be stuntin', throwin' cash
Rollin' wheels, gettin' blunted
All my niggas, they a hunnid
Trapper rappin', gettin' money
Why you niggas lookin' funny?
Chasin' bitches, trickin' money
I'm just stackin' up them hunnids
I be running to the bag, money gang we the brothers
All I do is work, all I do is work
All I do is work, all I do is work
I be stacking cash, I be ripping work
Fucking with my bag, put your picture on the shirt
All I do is work, all I do is work (step work)
I'm talkin' safety state, we gon' get that cake
I'm talkin' old things, watch them down upon the place (hey)
All I know is work, I be talkin' acrobatic shit
Run out with that work, I'ma let that automatic skip
Draco, Draco, Draco, I just bought a new Panatacrip
Meta with the plug, I'm talkin' twenty-mine-a-ton of shit
Call up the vatos, they gon' let the blocks blow
We be countin' lot of bands soon as the spot close
Ask the piece of know me I be 24 like Kobe
Posted on the block I'm in the truck rockin' a roadie
Pull up like a Uber, me a couple shoulders
Big corner keep rubbers if I call he gon' shoot ya
Usually have a 30 but right now I got a tray pound
Wrap them bricks up we hit the room like a freight hound
All I do is work, yeah, all I do is work, work, all I
All I do is work, all I do is work, work
I be stacking cash money, I be whipping work, working
Fucking with my bag, put you on the shirt, shirt
All I do is work, all I do is work, work
All I do is work, all I do is work, work
I'm talking safe and state, we gonna get that gate
I'm talking old things, bust them down up on the plate
It may be, it may be, it may be, it may be
