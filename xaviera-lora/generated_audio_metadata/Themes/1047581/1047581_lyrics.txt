I can sit on the yellow moon
Over the air, over the air
I left mine to get in this room
Over the air, over the air
The tide climbs but it takes some time
Over the air, over the air
But can't watch when I know it's mine
Over the air, over the air
Time locks it cold, a recognition
Time locks it full, to break these bellows
Relations
Elations, time locks it all
I should have seen this
I should have felt this
I should have known this
I never noticed but
I can't sit on the yellow moon
Over the air
Over the air
We are paddling
We are ailing
But are scrubbing the glen
What is ailing
What is waiting
Happy your direction's home
Time locks it cold, a recognition
Time locks it bold, to break these mellows
Relations, elations
Time locks it old, yeah
Time locks in cold, a recognition
Time locks in bold, to break these mellows
Relations, elations
Time locks in old
