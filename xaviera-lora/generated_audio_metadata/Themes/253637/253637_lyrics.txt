Well it's the North Coast Navigator
Deadly Decapitator
Collecting calls I'm a smooth operator
Shake your money maker
Baby we getting involved
Sweet talking lovely ladies
Till they taking it off
It ain't easy being this official
But I'm committed to linking and networking
Speaking with the purpose as I patrol the surface
Searching for a better way to prove a point
Today I got you soaking up my marinade
To help you elevate to a better place
Keep moving through time and space to avoid the rat race
Do you got what it takes and do you learn from your mistakes
When the pressure is great and if you fall will you rise again
To face another day another chance to win
I let the passion build within then release it through a raw rap
Preaching these facts till I establish contact
We ride all day and night it's a struggle everyday
I gotta stay alive we toast
Coast to coast, yeah you know them bae boys keep it poppin' the most
We connect, unlike the president, paying dues, battle proves
Man we earning respect, we network, only bringing the truth
And these hits'll leave you bruised but you'll love the abuse
How do I get my sound around?
How do I get them shaking and dancing and going wild?
How do I get it to travel from town to town and when they're on the internet browsing stopping and saying how?
How? Do I buy this CD right now?
Cause I really na-na-na-na-na need it like right now
Ciao, sayonara hasta la vista
I'm networking overseas, flossin' a visa
Never burn bridges or you'll never earn digits
Keep your handshake firm, this here's a stern business
Learn more than one trade or you'll get no action
Run the rock and play the field like Bo Jackson
These are the creature's intestines, lower than the beast's belly
So welcome to the industry
Nothing but a test for the hearts of men
So we ride stayin' high off cigars and hen neck
We ride
All day and night, it's a struggle everyday, I gotta stay alive
We toast, coast to coast, yeah you know them baby boys keep it poppin' the most
We connect, unlike the president, payin' dues, battle crews
Man we earnin' respect, we network, only bringin' the truth
Damn these hits'll leave you bruised but your love for your people
Every day's another struggle but I'm still surviving
Expressing reality from Cali to Mount Zion
My style is a positive twist like honey shaking the hips
I got the gift to leave mics ripped and I'm never stationary
I globetrot and launch from a land that the industry ot
North Coast, yeah I'm repping it right and I'm white
Like dude I'm out of sight
So can I get a witness
Soon to rise like bread
I'm so sick that I started a plague
It's a revolution
Small contribution
To those producing
Genuine true to life solutions
We getting close
No time to waste
Swallow your pride and hope
To remember the face
Of an all time great
Poetic primate
Bang on ear drums
Till the earth vibrates
We ride
All day and night
It's a struggle everyday
I gotta stay alive
We toast
Coast to coast, yeah you know them baby boys keep it poppin' the most
We connect, unlike the president
Payin' dues, battle proves, man we earnin' respect
We network, only bringin' the truth
And these hits'll leave you bruised but you'll love the abuse
