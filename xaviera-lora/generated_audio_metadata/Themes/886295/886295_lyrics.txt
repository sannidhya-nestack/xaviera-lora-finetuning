Ooh-ee-ooh, ooh-ee-ooh
You'll be so safe wrapped inside my arms tonight (ooh tonight)
Reach out and I'll be there in every morning light (or day)
And the sweetest dreams you're dreaming of will all be coming true
That's my good night promise to you
Despite the warning signs we didn't take it slow (take it slow)
Sometimes you wonder just how far this thing will go (go)
But I will love ya to the moon and back and then back to the moon
Yeah that's my good night promise to you
So many times (but many times) I tried to find (tried to, tried to find)
A love that could make me believe, oh
But now I know (now I know) that Cupid's bow (bow) has found its mark on me
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You wanted someone who would never run away
Someone who'd make you feel so special every day
Well the wish you made on a shooting star has finally come true
That's my good night promise
That's my good night promise
That's my good night promise to you.
