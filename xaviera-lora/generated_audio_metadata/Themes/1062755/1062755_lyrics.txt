Pop the bottles, stop the grotto
We finna turn up like we just hit the lotto
So keep popping bottles, what's the motto?
We live life like it's no tomorrow
Standing on stage, feeling so amazed
On how I'm gonna make it through every single day
Flow cuts swift like I get sick
Everybody and they mama know it don't play
Picture perfect panoramic they don't really understand it
How can you be dirty dancing when you ain't really romancing
Then I ended right there pretty girl long hair
Grinding all over my body while I'm sitting in a chair
Looking over to my left see Jay over there
Pop a lock and on the dance floor like he don't care
Got the club going berserk cause you know we putting in work
Got women taking off they shirts then they start to make it twerk
Super sexy many skirts
Talking to her real smooth cause you know that I'm a flirt
And she be the name and I'm not with the gang
So just give me the number right now and quit playing with
Popping bottles
We live a life of the moment and ain't no thing to enjoy it if you approaching like this
No tomorrow
So if you feeling alright just throw your hands to the top and let's get it popping at
Popping bottles
And we gon drink it up and live it up like we never gonna give up and do it like this
And we gon' keep partyin' until the break of dawn until we see ya by the day
Step up to the scene feelin' fresh to death all yes girl
You look serene in that dress I guess I just gotta confess
The mystique of your physique has got me feelin' weak but I still gotta progress
It's Saturday night, I'm suited and booted and yes I'm feeling alright and good
If you're feeling up to it you'll be the brother tonight when the clock is midnight
We can float with the ease of the morning and beat the dawn and take flight
And girl, I spent my night on the dance floor
I'm feeling hella turnt but after this we can dance slow
But now the DJ's playing my song
That's my cue, I gotta grab the microphone, get on the stage and perform
But now I'm in the zone, I'm so on
But before I'm gone, I need you on my arm
So N-S-G-E-C-J, bless the stage
We rockin' from the hotel ballrooms to the lobby
Now that's a party, poppin' bottles
We live a life of the moment, it ain't no thing to enjoy it if you approach it like this
No tomorrow
So if you're feelin' alright, just throw your hands to the top and let's get it poppin' at
Pop!
And we gon' drink it up and live it up like we never gonna give up and do it like this
No tomorrow
And we gon' keep partying until the break of dawn until we see a brighter day
Poppin' bottles
