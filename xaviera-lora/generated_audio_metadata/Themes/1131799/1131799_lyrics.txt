Duh, duh, delusional
I, I, I'm losing it
Keep, keep, keep, keep harassin'
Keep, keep, keep, keep harassin'
Parapara-paranoia
Can't trust you niggas, I don't know ya
Peepin' at my fuckin' blinds
Can't sleep at night, I lose my mind
Parapara-paranoia
They lookin' for me, I just know it
Where you at? Come out now
I got mouth, I don't fuck around
Para para paranoia
Can't trust you niggas I don't know ya
Peeping at my fucking blinds
Can't sleep at night I lose my mind
Para para paranoia
They looking for me I just know it
Where you at come out now
I got my cock don't fuck around
I'm Perry, no shit, I got a condition, keep clutchin' my clock
P-Hunter be trippin', hearin' some creeps from the wood in my kitchen
When I'm all alone, who's up in my home? Don't know when I get too hot
I be trippin', the voice in my mind is very malicious
Can't fuck with you snakes, only fuck with my niggas, young flame, hit'em up
He doin' so vicious, the synoclips, we're red beams
We not missus, he murder with the shits
Two not to mention, my brothers all from the mud
We gon' get it, man, stay with the blick if you lookin' suspicious
You reach for my chain, I'ma grunt to your wishes
New faces on search, not leavin' no witness
I'm more to a wolf
A beast who not spitting this shit can get ugly not dodging you niggas
It's thorting you niggas where the fucking money
Bullets stuck to his brain he can't think he a dummy
Sees a double back type him again he a goner this what happened
Can't fuck with the gang always outside but we constantly lurking
Once he's spotting we got him we closing their curtains
Don't think you can hide when we slide through we purging
Don't think you can hide when we slide through we purging
Paraparanoia can't trust you niggas I don't know ya
Peeping at my fucking blinds
Can't sleep at night I lose my mind
Paraparaparanoia
They looking for me I just know it
Where you at come out now
I got my got don't fuck around
I'm tripping and shit
Fuck a Glock keep a effing on me
Got no time for niggas plottin on me
If it's what you want then it's that's in the beat
It's that's in the beat stop woofing with me
You niggas bark but I bite bitch it sting
They want a verse but my features ain't free
So don't hit me up if you not paying the fee
Not paying the fee stop playing with me
Bitch I want everything a double R
A hundred acres in the park my cars
Can't trust nobody they'll leave you scarred
These bitches evil they don't got no hearts
Hoes gone be hoes just don't get attached
I can't love a bitch if I don't trust her ass
On my soul nigga I don't wanna ask
A nigga like me just gone chase a bag
If you move to one way you can get stretched
Cause my demons they talking I talk back
I can't clean up my sins with a bloody rag
They testing my patience I'm not into waiting
I feel like a monster who just got awakened
These niggas they weak and that ain't for debating
I'm done playing around move the fuck out my face
I peep everything like it's up on display
I'm paranoid looking all over the place wanna kill all these niggas nobody is safe
When I creep through the dark then I lurk and I wake
I'm eternal a venom just like a cray snake
Pop out with a mask now I'm ready to sell ya
I'm P-Hunter make sure you remember my name
I'm P-Hunter make sure you remember
Parapara paranoia
Can't trust you niggas I don't know ya
Peeping out my fucking blinds
Can't sleep at night I lose my mind
Parapara paranoia
They looking for me I just know it
Where you at come out now
I got my walk I don't fuck around
Pair, pair, paranoia
Can't trust you niggas, I don't know ya
Peepin' at my fuckin' blinds
Can't sleep at night, I lose my mind
Pair, pair, paranoia

Where you at? Come out now
I got my Glock, don't fuck around
