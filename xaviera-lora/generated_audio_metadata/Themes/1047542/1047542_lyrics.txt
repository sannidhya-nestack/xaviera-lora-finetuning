Back and forth with no rule
To catch the fall
Any answer now can reach the home of all
Broken reason, untuned
A different name
Out of worry I can
Give your life the same
It's all I see this time
And I thought it but I
I never dreamed it'd come true
My situation fell through
Why get it? Why make it?
I found a roadmap through the front line
To the good times
I'm afraid it's untrue
How they say that thing
Of writing on the wall
And I thought it but I
I never dreamt it'd come true
Consideration felt through
Why get it? Why make it?
I found a roadmap through the front lines
To the good times
The power is now within me
Till the memories stop
And though the release is empty
It's a way to the top
I might be broken
But the less I worry
The less I hurry
The closer I become
Back and forth and no rule
To catch the fall
Any answer now can reach the home of all
I never dreamed it'd come true
My situation fell through
Why get it? Why make it?
I found a road lead through the front line
To the good times
