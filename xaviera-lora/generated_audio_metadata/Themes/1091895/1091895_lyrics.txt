That one's you
You got my heart
You got my heart
You got my heart
Couldn't be me and you
I invite the bros and I try to push you on the homie
But you just told him how bad you wanted to get to know me
Nothing I do or say could ever push you away
Cause you think you're here to stay
I don't wanna play these games
And you still think I could be the one
And nothing in your heart says to run
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why is you, so why is you, so why is you chasing?
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why you, so why you, so why you chasing?
So why you chasing?
So why you chasing?
This ain't no movie, I'm no Bobby Brown to Daroni
I'm not that person, so don't try to act like you know me
Nothing I do or say could ever push you away
you think you're here to stay
Please don't make me call her bae
Don't make me call her bae
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why is you, so why is you, so why is you chasing?
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why is you, so why is you, so why is you chasing?
So why'd you chase it?
Couldn't be me and you
Tryna find someone
Probably won't end up too good
Tryna find someone
Probably won't end up too good
Tryna find someone to love
Probably won't end up too good
Steady tryna be my missus
When I just think you're misunderstood
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why is you, so why is you, so why is you chasing?
You got my heart racing
You wanna be the one but you cannot replace it
So why is you, so why is you, so why is you chasing?
So why is you chasing?
