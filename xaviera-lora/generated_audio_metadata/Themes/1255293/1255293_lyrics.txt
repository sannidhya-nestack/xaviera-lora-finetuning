I gotta say it
We are withering on the vine
The complications
The only thing keeping this thing alive
I don't mind if that's how it's gonna be
But don't stay here to keep the appearance you need
Here we are, circling each other from afar
Here we are, who's gonna make the first move baby?
It used to be simple
It used to be just you and I
Then came the morning
And you couldn't look me in the eye
I don't mind if that's how it's gonna be
But don't stay here to keep the appearance you need
Here we are
Circling each other from afar
Here we are
Who's gonna make the first move baby
Here we are
Circling each other from afar
Here we are
Who's gonna make the first move baby
