Give is a hard thing, it's like a wild rodeo
Sometimes you hold on tight, sometimes you let it go
It's a roller coaster ride, full of twists and turns
But when it's real, how your heart burns
Love is a hard thing, but it's worth the fight
Through the darkest nights and the brightest light
It's a journey of highs and lows, joy and pain
But in the end, love is all that remains
Love is a hard thing
It's not always easy
Sometimes messy
Sometimes it's breezy
It's a dance of compromise
A balancing act
But when it's true there's no turning back
Love is a hard thing but it's worth the fight
Through the stormy days and the starry nights
It's a test to faith, a leap of trust
But in the end, but in the end love is always just
It's not always sunshine, it's not always rain
But through it all love still remains
It's the blue that blinds us, the fire that ignites
Love is a hard thing but it's our guiding light
Love is a hard thing but it's our guiding light
Love is a hard thing, but it's our guiding light
Love is a hard thing, but it's our guiding light
