It's getting dark above the sky
The night is shy and so am I
It's cloudy night, the rain of stars
Just see the world in your sweet eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
It's getting dark above the sky
The night is shy and so am I
It's cloudy night, the rain of stars
Just see the world in your sweet eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
Oh, in your eyes, in your eyes
Oh, in your eyes, in your eyes
Oh, in your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes
