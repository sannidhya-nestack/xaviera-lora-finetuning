Lights are glowing, laughter fills the air
Hearts together, joy and love we share
The old year fades, the new begins to shine
We step into twenty-two, he says
Your hand in mine (oh, oh)
Feel the magic rise
Oh, happy new year everyone
Oh, another joy joy as the celebration's begun
Dreams awake and shining like the stars
Together forever no matter how far
Candles flicker, wishes take their flight
Smiles and laughter brighten up the night
Hands together, hearts that glow with cheer

May hope surround you too
Ooh, oh, joy in every face
