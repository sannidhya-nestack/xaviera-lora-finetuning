Gonna get my chores done
Call all my friends
tonight is the night
Kwanzaa begins
Can't wait to light the candles
One by one
Sit around telling stories of where we came from
Sharing our past with songs to sing about women and men
Warriors and kings, I'll ask you in Swahili, what's the news?
We've come so far but there's so much more to do
So what's your favorite holiday?
Kwanzaa

Spell it K-W-A-N-Z-A-A

We'll talk about faith, hard work and pride
With our families and friends standing side by side
We'll pass the Unity Cup, dance through the night
As we watch the candles burn down our future burns bright
Remembering our people and our history
It's a special week for you and me
So come and celebrate this holiday
Kwanzaa's in our hearts to light the way
What's your favorite holiday?
