Gather round the wooden table laid
Stories of our year and blessings made
Pumpkin pies and dreams we savour slow
Laugh until the fire embers glow
Turkey roasted golden in the heat
Family together feels so sweet
Cheers to the days that brought us here
Hearts so full our worries disappear
Thank you for this feast we've grown
For the love and joy that we have known
Gratitude in every bite we take
Every smile and hug we make
Leaves of amber dancing in the breeze
Kids chasing dreams beneath the trees
Gravy poured on moments so refined
Sharing life with kin of heart and mind
Thank you for this feast we've grown
For the love and joy that we have known
Gratitude in every bite we take
Every smile and hug we make
Candles flicker by the window's light
Memories made so clear, so bright
Give and receive with arms open wide
In this moment, in this night
Thank you for this feast we've grown
For the love and joy that we have known
Gratitude in every bite we take
Every smile and hug we make
Every smile and hug we make
Candles flicker by the window's light
Memories made so clear, so bright
Give and receive with arms open wide
In this moment, in this night
Turkey roasted golden in the heat
Family together feels so sweet
Cheers to the days that brought us here
Hearts so full our worries disappear
In this moment, hug
We make
