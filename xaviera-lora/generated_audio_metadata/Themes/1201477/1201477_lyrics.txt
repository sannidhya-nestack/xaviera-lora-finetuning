Well, I need a rainstorm to come and wash all over me
I ain't looking for answers from you, honey
I ain't looking for some kind of retreat
I've been weighing out the virtue of the man you want me to be
So if you're looking for some kind of lover, honey, that's some kind as me
And that's a fact
Oh baby that's a cold hard fact
My love is steady
Oh who else could tell you that
Yes I'm steady
My love is a fact
Yes it is
Yes it is honey
Who else could tell you that
Well there's a fire
It's out on the border of this town
Some days I'm afraid
It's gonna come burn the whole place down
But if I lost all my possessions
Lord if I was a penniless man
My home would be safe within your arms
So I'm doing the best I can
That's a fact
Oh baby that's a cold hard fact
My love is a study
Yeah who else can tell you that
Yes I love to study
My love is a fact
Yes it is yes it is honey
Who else can tell you that
Come on now
Well love's a shell game, honey
I've seen it a thousand times through
Everybody's looking for some kind of feeling
You know, something bright and shiny new
But I'm learning a lesson
Getting all tangled up in you
I don't think that love is some kind of feeling
No, it's a God's honest truth
That's a fact
Oh baby that's a cold hard fact
My love is steady
Who else can tell you that
Yes I'm steady
My love is a fact
Yes it is
Yes it is honey
Who else can tell you that
So it's a fact
It's a cold hard fact
My love is steady
Oh who else can tell you that
Yes I'm steady
My love is a fact
Yes it is
Who else can tell you that
Oh that's a fact
I got your back
My love is steady
That's a fact, you know I can weather the storm, honey
Yeah, this heart is built to last
Honey, I hope you know
My love is a fact
