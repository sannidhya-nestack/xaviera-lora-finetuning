Midnight secrets on a Friday night
Wake up early catch the morning lights
Watching from the hillside
Chair planes sketching out the blue skyline
No one's here, it's just you and I jumping
How far we'll drive
What's in my hand, what you want, what I will be
Let me see what you see
Oh take my time what you want I will be let me see what you see
Oh just take my hand what you want I will be let me see what you see
Oh just take my life what you want I will be let me see what you see
Rolling steady down some empty roads
We're just chilling in our windy clothes
What's next for you and I?
Loving everything that makes us grow
No telling us what our future holds
Jump up and see where we go
Oh take my hand what you want I will be let me see what you see
Oh take my time what you want I will be let me see what you see
Oh just take my hand what you want I will be let see what you see
Oh, just take my life, what you want I will be
Let me see what you see
I think I'm falling, oh can't you see?
We are building up piece by piece
Take my hand and you will see
Oh, take my hand, what you want, I will be
Let me see what you see
Oh, take my time, what you want, I will be
Let me see what you see
Oh, just take my hand, what you want, I will be
Let me see what you see
I'll just take my life, what you want I won't be
Let me see what you see
Let me see what you see
Let me see what you see
