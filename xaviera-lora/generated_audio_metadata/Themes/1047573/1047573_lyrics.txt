You cannot come around here with a lightning round smile
Carry with your kiss your intentions live
Dance with the rowdy of the kids in a package outside
Atlas and a ticket for the last good ride
But I guess you miss the city life
So run around, roll with the hills and an underground hype
Sorry but it doesn't seem to reach your door
Happy with a passionate wish and a passionless life
At the very least you're done for sure
But the ride was so unending
It made me wish I'd seen it right
It's a good number days when the moonlight is able and the pride of vacation vibes, oh
And it's all you know, let the anthem rock
So follow the sounds and root out the ocean
Put a tent on the tragic side, oh
And the battle's slow and it's all I know
The rally cries come overnight and the ribbon ignites
Copycat really couldn't ask for more
Shower town, shower with a trail on the shadowless side
Copycat really couldn't reach the door
But I guess you missed the secret light
So gone are the days when moonlight is able in the bright of vacation lights
Oh, it's all you know when the anthem broke
And follow the sounds of the moon on the ocean
Put a tent in the tragic side, oh
And if a battle's won, and it's all I know
It's the third of the days with the moonlight is able
It's the pride of vacation lives, oh
It's all you know when the anthems roll
