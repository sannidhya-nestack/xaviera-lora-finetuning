Oh, when she wakes up
She's all alone, does her makeup
But hopeful, she's a dreamer
Just like I, and I can see us
Together I'm fine
So ain't it about time now you gave in?
Put up your white flag?
So ain't it about time now you realized?
You've got a good heart
Crying real tears
Crying real tears
I soak tomorrow
We'll get some work done
You need to borrow time
I'm so Muslim, I'm
And you need it
You just gotta have a man
What about me?
And all the stuff we have
I was waiting about time, now you gave in
You're a white pig
So ain't it about time now
You realized
You've got a good heart
Crying real tears
Crying
Real tears, cries, real tears
Michael you could be bleached from head to heart
Too late about time now
You gave in
With all your heart and hand
Too late about time now
You realized
You've got a good heart
Crying
Real tears, crying
Real tears, she cries
Real tears, could be my girl
But she bleeds in here
