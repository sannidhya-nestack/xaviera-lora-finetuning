I've felt the rhythm of the wheels
Rolling on this broken road
For just how long I just don't know
But I believe a man can change
Turn around, find a way
Back out of the wilderness, so
I'm dreaming and driving tonight
Cause you're all I need to make it right
I lost my way but I'll keep trying to find your light
So I'm dreaming and driving
And I'll admit I've had a few
Sleepless nights, sleepwalking days
And daydreams of drifting back to you
And I'll admit that you were right
And I was wrong and now I know
That you are still so right for me
So I'm dreaming and driving
Driving tonight
you're all I need to make it right
I lost my way but I'll keep trying to find your light
So I'm dreaming and driving
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So, I'm dreaming and driving tonight
you're all I need to make it right
I wonder if you still want me, I think you might
So I'm dreaming and driving
So I'm dreaming and driving tonight
Cause you're all I need to make it right
I lost my way but I'll keep trying to find your light
So I'm dreaming and driving
