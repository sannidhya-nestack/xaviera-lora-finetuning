I've been holding on
Hoping for something to change
I keep moving on
Pushing myself to the brink
Got to stop
Thinking of times with family and friends all around me
Laughter and smiles and living so carefree
Here you are, here you are
I carry these times with me
Memories that I keep
I've been away for a thousand years
But when I have part in my heart I will always be close to home
Carry on, carry on
No time to get lost in these things
Just keep strong, keep on pushing on
See what the future brings
Close your eyes and dream
I must have bought
For a million miles of the world
Stay true to my rules so that I can be close to home
I've been gone for a thousand years
No matter the time, ain't no mind I will always be close to home
When it's dark, so dark to see
And it's hard
So hard to believe
I just try to remember
I've already got what I need
I've been away for a thousand years
No matter how far in my heart I will always be close to home
And even when it seems so long
Together it feels we were never alone
Close to home
I'll be able alone
We'll talk alone
Until then I know
Soon I'll be home
