Prevention, enslaved, suppressed
Directed to separate, underlined, jobless
Music made lame and we communicating
Hands for the doubters cause they all running mates
It's my passion produced with sincerity
Unrestrained music escape common liberty
In the city with so much empathy
Bright with a mic job pushing pump purity
When I move fast I zoom like a Steph
I'm so deep in it all I know is my death
Don't be mistaken I don't do it by myself
These MC's are tripping why you lying to yourself
I took information then applied pressure
Increased lyrical density squeezed crushed compression
Grabbed the mic then flow with the net sign
It gave some attention it gave back affection
Listen and decode hear the confession
The message that blends all problems
It's a small world job course direction
Boundary over step ive transgressions
Let me know when the devil's at the intersection
659 I take them straight to seventh heaven
Unjust use of force authority oppression
A dark maturity of the youth and adolescence
Prevention enslaved suppressed
Directed to separate underlined jobless
Music made lame and we communicating hands for the doubters cause they all running mates
It's my passion produced with sincerity
Unrestrained music escape common liberty
In the city with so much empathy
Bright with a mic job pushing pump purity
I spit the truth this is my profession
I float in a mic turn gold in a session
Remember my level magnified all the sacrifices I made the position still occupied
This is why they get analyzed classified as savages they need to be neutralized
This is why your fans not satisfied this is why they ratify you're not qualified
You're an MC this must be a scam you didn't grab the program or even pass the exam
Native speaking, educated language received
My flow is for the people in the land of bereaved
I translate in the eye of intimidation
A soul vibration, lyrical blood relation
Yes, I'll take the breast of the lamb
And give thanks to my claim I have on Abraham
Prevention, enslave, suppress
Directed to separate, underline, jobless
Music made lame and we communicating
Hands for the doubters cause they all running mates
It's my passion produced with sincerity
Unrestrained music escape common liberty
In the city with so much empathy
Bright with a mic job pushing pump purity
I swear just give me a reason
I have you in treatment getting out next season
You lose, we win, connected, Ali flows
Oh, here we go again
That's not happening, you're a has been
As a matter of fact, I know that bum's your twin
Don't overestimate or attempt to debate
To outflow my words so the song recreates
Lower to higher position my spit elevates
Establish a protest when a demon demonstrates
Coast to coast and it all seems local
Tornado flow minus that damage control
Forty or fifty thousand no matter the total
Motion that up front I'll be at your disposal
Party people assemble together
We social to menace to show time
Let me adjust my vocals
Prevention
Enslave, suppress
Directed to separate, underline, jobless
Music made lame and we communicate in hands for the doubters cause they all running mates
It's my passion produced with sincerity
Unrestrained music escape common liberty
In the city with so much empathy
Bright with the mic job pushing pump purity
