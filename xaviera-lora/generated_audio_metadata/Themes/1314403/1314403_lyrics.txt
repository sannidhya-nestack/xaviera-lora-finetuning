You are the power, nurturing spirit
Sharing your wisdom with all who will hear
You are the healer, you are the giver
Your love is flowing
Just like a river
Oh mother
You are beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
You are the heartbeat
Of this family
Weaving life's magic
In those you hold dear
You shine so brightly, making a difference
Without your presence, life would have no meaning
Oh mother
You are beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
Mother
You are beautiful
So beautiful
