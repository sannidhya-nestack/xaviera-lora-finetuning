Happy Mother's Day, Mama
Today I celebrate you
Thank you for all you've done
And for everything you do
You celebrated my first step
Like I walked on the moon
Happy Mother's Day, Mama
Today I celebrate you
When life knocked me down
I'd hear you shouting, "Son, get back up"
For every bruised, skinned up elbow on me
The best medicine was your love
Happy Mother's Day, Mama
Yeah, today I celebrate you
Thank you for all you've done and for everything you do
You celebrated my first step like I walked on the moon
Happy Mother's Day, Mama, today I celebrate you
You were always there to push me over the finish line
There's never been a sweeter kind of soul and no better mama than mine
Happy Mother's Day mama
Day I celebrate you
Thank you for all you've done and for everything you do
You celebrated my first step
Like I walked on the moon
Happy Mother's Day
Mama, today I celebrate you
Every sacrifice you made
Every dream you put on hold
Mom, you always put me first
And helped me go for the gold
Happy Mother's Day
Today I celebrate you
Happy Mother's Day, Mama
Today I celebrate you
