I can tell that there's something turning in your mind
And we both know that this can't be your good side now
Girl, you know that I hate it when things aren't right
And I feel that it is just a matter of time
Until we break up
My heart is bruised and broken
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be, you don't wanna be just friends
Wouldn't you agree that this is
Just the same old story
About a boy who tried to
Get over a girl
Who let him love her once, yeah
And then we broke up
My heart is bruised and broken
All that I loved once, yeah
And then we broke up, yeah
My heart is bruised and broken
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be, you don't wanna be
I can't be, I can't be just friends
