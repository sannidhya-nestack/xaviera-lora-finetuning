When I was a little girl
Our backyard was my whole world
A place filled with dreams and butterflies
I'd run to you when I scraped my knee
With a kiss and a smile
You'd comfort me and send me right back outside
To chase them all again
The years have come and they have gone
My childhood and the world moved on
And I'm so proud to be
The person you helped me to become
All I am I owe to you
How could one day be enough to thank you?
In my life, every day is Mother's Day
I look around in my life today
And I see in so many ways
The blessings your love has brought to life
You taught me how to laugh and love
That less than my best is never enough
And to be a woman would still keep the girl alive
So I laugh at the mistakes I make
I still stumble but I'm brave
Because I know my worth
And the beauty that lives inside of me
All I am, I owe to you
How could one day be enough to thank you in my life?
Every day is Mother's Day
When I look in the eyes of my little girl
I pray that I might be
Half the mother you have been to me
May she laugh and may she love
May she know she's good enough to find every dream
Every happiness under the sun
All I am I owe to you
How could one day be enough to thank you
And tell you I love you
Every day is Mother's Day in my life
Every day is Mother's Day
