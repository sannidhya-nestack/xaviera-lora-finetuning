(Yeah!)
Up on the rooftop, snow crunches below
Santa's laughing, ho-ho-ho in the glow
Reindeer are prancing, sleigh bells go zing-zing
Children shout, "Yeah! Let the joy begin !"
Snowballs flying, scarves spinning around
Magic is popping, wonder abounds
Candy canes swinging, stars sparkling bright
Everyone dancing in the sparkling night
Ho-ho-ho
Ride with me through snowy skies, wild and free (yeah)
The laughter flows where Santa goes, the magic grows
Frosty is skating, jingling his hat (Ha!)
Elves are giggling, chasing the cat (Ha!)
Snowflakes like confetti drift from above
It's a winter wonderland full of love!
Lights flash like fireworks, glittering the street
Children stamping, clapping, "Yee-haw !" to the beat
Santa spins around, sleigh bells in the air
Magic everywhere, laughter everywhere!
Ho, ho, ho, ride with me
Through snowy skies, wild and free, yee-haw!
The laughter flows where Santa goes
The magic grows, hoo-hoo, yee-haw!
Snowy adventures begun
Dance, laugh, jingle
Sparkle holiday fun
