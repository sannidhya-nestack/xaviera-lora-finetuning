A daunting task, I feel at risk
Too many choices, which path is fake?
This direction I create
Will it seal my fate?
A dead end I feel I've reaped
A decision made
Which path I take
My mind racing, is it a mistake?
Another solution consumes me in time
Too many paths, I want 80 in mind
To persevere and make it right
Many factors judge my mind
This course of mine perceived by many
I'm out of touch help me reach serenity
A decision made, this path I take
My mind racing, is it a mistake
Another solution
Consumes me in time
Too many paths
I want eighty in mind
It gets brighter
This road I'm on
People are waving
The strategy is strong
And sudden thoughts
Corrodes my idea
Stuck in the middle
Which direction this time?
A decision made
This path I take
My mind racing
Is it a mistake?
Another solution
Consumes me in time
Too many paths
I want eighty in mind
