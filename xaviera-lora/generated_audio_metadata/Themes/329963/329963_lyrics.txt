B-Y-M-B-Y B-Y-M-B-Y
We are often tossed and driven
On this restless sea of time
Somber skies and howling tempests
Often succeed the bright sunshine
In the land of
Perfect day when the mist has rolled away
For we will understand it better by and by
For we will understand it better by and by
Pride and pride
Trials dark on every hand
And we cannot understand
Of the ways that God would lead us to that blessed promised land
But he guides us with his eye and we'll follow till we die
For we will understand it better by and by
For we will understand it better by and by
Oh, sing it with me (bye and bye)
Oh, we'll understand it better by and by (bye and bye)
Oh, when the saints of God get to go home (bye and bye)
We'll understand it
We'll understand this pain (bye and bye)
We'll understand this heartache (heartache)
We had to go through it to get to the end of it (oh, we will understand it better by and bye)
Stand it better, flyin' by, flyin' by
For we will under, stand it better, flyin' by, flyin' by
When the morning comes (by and by)
All the saints have got a gathering home (by and by)
They're gonna tell the old, old story how we've overcome (by and by)
Yes, for we will wonder, understand it better, much much better, by and by, in the sweet by and by
Yes we will, yes we will, for we will wonder, we're gonna see it face to face, by and by, by and by
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Bye and bye (yeah)
Bye and bye, yeah (one of those sort of)
Bye and bye (bye and bye)
In the sweet bye and bye
Bye and bye
When we all get to see Jesus (say)
Bye and bye
Don't you wanna go there?
Always in a wonder
And it better by and by, by and by, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
For we will under, we'll understand it better by and by, by and by, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
