If it don't put a twinkle in both your eyes
Light you up and make you shine
No baby, it ain't Christmas
If it don't make your jingle bells ring-a-ling
Give your heart a reason to sing
No baby, it ain't Christmas
If it doesn't feel right
You're mine with golden memories
If you don't wake up to find the world's in harmony
If the love's underflowing and the smiles aren't showing
And no one's getting no kisses then you know
It ain't Christmas, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
If you don't have a carol on the tip of your tongue
The holly ain't jolly and the stockings ain't hung
No baby, it ain't Christmas
If you don't wanna hug everybody you meet
Give a little more, then you'll receive no baby
It ain't Christmas if it doesn't feel right
Fill your mind with golden memory
If you don't wake up to find the world's in harmony
If the love's underflowing and the smiles aren't showing
And no one's getting no kisses then you know
If it ain't ho, ho, ho everywhere you go
Street lights dressed up in pretty red bows
If you ain't thinking'bout the mistletoe
Then you know, then you know, then you know it ain't Christmas
If it doesn't fill your mind with golden memories
If you don't wake up to find the world's in harmony
If the love's underflowing and the smiles aren't showing
And no one's getting no kisses then you know, you know
It ain't Christmas (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Oh, yeah)
