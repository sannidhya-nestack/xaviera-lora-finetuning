True that I say, as Lainey relays her day
The joy she displays, makes me want to be with her
Day after day, the curly blonde hair
Dimples in her cheeks, the way Lainey frowns
The way Lainey speaks
Lady, let's dance
Her temples implode
She grabs my hand
And leads me to another world
A feeling oh so good
Of dancing with this girl
A feeling oh so fine
Lady, you blow my mind
It's because of you I'm content inside
The feeling you leave keeps me going till
The next sun shines, joyfully delight
The sentiments you leave behind not many have done that
Lainey you're divine
Lady let's dance, her temples implode
She grabs my hand and leads me to another world
A feeling oh so good, of dancing with this girl
A feeling oh so fine, lady you blow my mind
What will be the next high?
As I kissed Lainey goodbye
Will she take me to the sky?
Or will she say bye?
Lainey asked me inside
I accepted with a smile
With our eyes closed
No thoughts involved
We rocked each other's world
Lady, let's dance
Her dimples implode
She grabs my hand
And leads me to another world
A feeling oh so good
Of dancing with this girl
A feeling oh so fine
Lady, you blow my mind
Lady, let's dance
Her dimples implode
She grabs my hand
And leads me to another world, a feeling oh so good
Of dancing with this girl, a feeling oh so fine
Lady in blonde, my lady in extents
Her temples inflown, she grabs my hand
And it leads me to another world, a feeling oh so good
I'm dancing with this girl, a feeling oh so fine
Lady you blow my mind
