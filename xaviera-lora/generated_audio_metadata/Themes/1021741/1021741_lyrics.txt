I sit outside at night
And search for your star
It's easy to find, it's the brightest one in the sky
I long to fly where you are, to meet you on a cloud
We'll talk of things we wish we tried
You walk with me in my dreams
You hold me, I'm a child
You care for and comfort me
I'm blessed by your smile
And looking for the face of love
Been looking for those eyes so clear
I see the face of love and I see you
Been looking for the face of love
Been looking for those eyes so clear
I see the face of love and I see you
There's joy in heaven, such a gift that they have in you
Treasure of treasures, you were a very good man
No more pain, no sorrow, no guilt, you're finally free
What does it feel like to be everything you've wanted to be
Been looking for the face of love
Been looking for those eyes so clear
I see the face of love and I see you
Been looking for the face of love
Been looking for those eyes so clear
I see the face of love and I see you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
