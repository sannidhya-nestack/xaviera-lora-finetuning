We packed your daddy's Honda up to the roof
Just you and me and a spring break ride
Playlist on your phone, JT to the stones
We played it over and over and over and over and over
All the way to the beach and back
Singing along we were making good time
Every song became the soundtrack
We would be playing for the rest of our lives
Put ourselves in every line
And fell in love
Three minutes at a time
Three minutes at a time
You and your pink painted toes out the window
Sipping cold lemonade with your seat laid back
Your hand melting ice on my sunburned neck
We were getting closer and closer and closer and closer and closer
All the way to the beach and back
Singing along we were making good time
Every song became the soundtrack
We will be playing for the rest of our lives
Put ourselves in every line
Fell in love
Three minutes at a time
Three minutes at a time
And put ourselves in every line
And fell in love
All the way to the beach and back
Singing along we were making good time
Every song became the soundtrack
We would be playing for the rest of our lives
Put ourselves in every line
And fell in love
Three minutes at a time
Three minutes at a time
Three minutes at a time
