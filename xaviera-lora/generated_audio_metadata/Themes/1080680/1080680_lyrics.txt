In time, you're off my list
In case, you're on your knees
You are more than welcome
Welcome to open up
These lies you can't deny
But it should
I've been proven
In size, you're small enough
Two times out this bag of mine
And you are more than welcome
Welcome to open up
Thieves lies you can't deny
Our mixture of approval
These lies you can't deny
Our mixture of approval
These lies (these lies) you can't deny (these lies)
Why is there no question of approval? (these lies)
