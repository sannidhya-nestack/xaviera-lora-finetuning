My friends are calling me by my name
They shared my room with Ali
And I say, "Oh la la la la, oh la la la la"
We're going to the party right now
They hear how we're singing out loud
And I say ooh la la la la
When you look again you are growing old
And you happen to attend
When you look again you're not as shy
You can't live in yesterday
Someone told me to leave behind
Memories of the past keep going
On the way you have
Cause you cannot come back
Someone told me
To leave behind
Memories of the past
Keep going
On the way you have
Cause you cannot, you cannot come back
We're going to the party right now
They hear how we sing and laugh
And I say ooh la la la la
When you look again
You are growing old
And you have nothing to attend
When you look again
You're not as shy
You can live in yesterday
Someone told me
To leave behind
Memories of the past
Keep going
On the way you have
you cannot come back
Someone told me
To leave behind
Memories of the past
Keep going
On the way you have
you cannot
You cannot come back
Look again
You are growing now
And you have nothing to attend
When you look again, you're not as shy, you can live in yesterday
Someone told me to leave behind memories of the past
Keep going on the way you have,'cause you cannot come back
Someone told me to leave behind memories of the past
Keep going
On the way you have
you cannot, you cannot come back
