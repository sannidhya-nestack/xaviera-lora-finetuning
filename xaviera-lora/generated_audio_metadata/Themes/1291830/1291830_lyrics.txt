I run to the end of the earth
That's what I'm willing to do
After I've seen your face again
Looking ahead
The world is at my heels
I must show some control
Before my imagination becomes real
I let my dreams get the best of me
I was in love at first sight
I don't know what you're feeling
Like a strong desire
My heart beats of romance
Closing my eyes rapidly I could take this chance
Crossing paths I'm looking to the future
Crossing paths I can't go back to the past
Crossing paths, I must make this dream come true
And cut my time in half
I want to propose to this love
Staring in silence
I wait for your entrance
My sensation
Feels strong at night
With lots of heart to go around
Your presence is out of sight
The days grow shorter the nights come faster
My impression drives on strong
These moments must last forever
To the heat of the light
I'm in love with this beautiful moment
Your beauty is just right
While your personality grows contagious
Your affection grows with the sunlight
Forever and ever
This feeling is just right
Forever and ever
This feeling is just right
