We can give it away
We have time for the tide down forever this way
While our comet comes down less so spatial
And more so raining
Branching with the fallen in play
And a light storm with problems left sure to delay
While I pine for my fine special placement
When we stay alive short of late leveling
Ask me why our stage is made for today
Can we take our minds out of safe, irrelevant, soft smiles and shadows all carried with dull smiles and play?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah ah
With my lies giving way
And my stoplight and stopped knife got taken away
And my power of leaving was taken and given
Back, return, oh the day
The cloudy lakes part suddenly
Everywhere I've been I go back today
I can say, although the trees hate withering
Funny the line where it says we can make it decay
La la la la la, la la la la la, ha, ha, la la la la la, ooh ooh, la la la la, la la la la, ha, ha
Can we stay alive short of late leveling?
Ask me why our stage is made for today
Can we take our minds out of safe relevance?
Soft smiles and shadows all carried with
Doll smiles and play
