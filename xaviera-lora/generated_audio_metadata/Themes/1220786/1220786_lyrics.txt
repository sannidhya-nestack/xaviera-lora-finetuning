I ain't got nothing to say
It won't get you down
I gotta turn my head away
To hide my pride
I don't need to love you
But I won't be sorry if I do
I gotta close the curtains to conceal the shadows
Gotta turn off the music to drown out the screams
To see you hurt is my last wish
But I think I prefer my face like it is
I don't mean to laugh at you
But I won't be sorry if I do
To see you hurt is my last wish
But I think I prefer my face like it is
