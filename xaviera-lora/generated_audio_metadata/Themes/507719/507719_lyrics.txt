Fingers running through my hair
You were always there
I still feel your breath on my neck
In a chance too vivid to et
Our frozen silhouette
Framed in our regret
We could laugh while we conquered the world
We could not not guess
I could hold you one more time (one more time)
What I would give if we could just have one more night (one more night)
I can't live without you, baby, without you, baby
I don't wanna be here without you
It's still just like before you left
I haven't cleaned your mess
And now it's cold on your side of the bed
Used to laugh while we conquered the world
Could my mind make it last?

I could hold you one more time (one more night would be) what I would give if we could just have one more night (cause I can't live without you) cause I can't live without you baby without you baby I don't wanna be here without you
We could laugh while we conquer the world
If I could hold you one more time
What I would give if
Could just have one more night (one more night)
Feels like I'm there without you baby
Without you baby
Without you baby
Without you baby
I don't wanna be here without you
