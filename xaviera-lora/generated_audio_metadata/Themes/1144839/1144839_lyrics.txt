You want to be the coolest in LA
Show off to your friends every day
You talk a lot, getting louder every word
Religion gets political
And you spilled something on the front of your shirt
Let's just chill together
I wanna be with you forever
Let's just chill together
I wanna be with you forever
Let's just chill together
I want to know, where do all the people go
To kill over their matters most
You used to laugh, riding bikes with pretend guns
A sober man, a peaceful lord
Let's just chill together
Wanna be with you forever
Let's just chill together
I wanna be with you forever
Let's just chill together
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day.
