Well, the secret that it's been a long climb is in all about you, yeah
You're on a slave'til you've spent your last dime
And everyone knew, yeah
You were a sucker for a real good time
Your own true love is all
You think of
Why don't you tell me the news and leave me confused
Why don't you sing me the blues and shuffle your shoes
Why don't you show me your boobs and keep being abused
Don't eat, don't sleep, don't even be the Eden if you don't wanna see
Your own true love is all you think of
Another crash, get your law on supply
Gone far too long, yeah
Got all the answers but you're high in the sky
And everyone's wrong, yeah
A bitter pill until the day that you die
You're wrong
True love is all you think of
Why don't we stop all the hate
Before it's too late
An indescribable fate
And an avoidable day
Stop all the endless debate
We cannot relate
Don't cheat, daddy
But even the absurdity has pointed at me
Your own true love is all you think of
Your own true love you put nothing above
