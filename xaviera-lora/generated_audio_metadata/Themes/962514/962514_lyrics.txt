Ooh, should old acquaintance be
ot and never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be ot
In days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne
And here's a hand, my trusty friend
That gives a hand to thine
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
Lang Syne, my dear
For old Lang Syne
We'll take a cup of kindness, yes
For old Lang Syne
We'll take a cup
Of kindness, yes, for auld lang syne
