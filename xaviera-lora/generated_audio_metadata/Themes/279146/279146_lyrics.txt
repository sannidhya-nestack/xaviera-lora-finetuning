Ever since the first time that I saw your face
I knew one day you would be mine
I'm blessed to have someone fine as you
Your beauty brings tears to my eyes
You make me say ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, lady, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, oh.
Ooh, yeah, ah
My inspiration and motivation
You're my sunshine and my pressure
You're my queen
You're so special, so beautiful
Lady, you are so precious
You complete me
Every day I thank the Lord for sending you my way
Even though grammatically it's hard to find the words to say
But I'm talking to your soul through your ears
Listen to the melody in my song
I hope you hear me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It really doesn't matter that you're fine
I love your body, soul and mind
And the way that your heart shines
I'm so blessed that you are mine
You make a brother feel complete
I love you from your heart out to your feet
24 hours, 7 days a week (From this moment to eternity)
I will always be by your side (I'll even catch your tear drops when you cry)
Listen closely while I testify (Testify)
I will always love you more than you'll ever know, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
