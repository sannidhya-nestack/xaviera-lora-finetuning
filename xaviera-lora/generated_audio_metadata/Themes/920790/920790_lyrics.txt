My how time flies when you're having fun
Seems you just got here this morning hun
Well it's nearly half past one
And you got to go love
I know what we can find
A reason to lose the time
I know we'll find a way to stay
Say it ain't so
Time to go love
Say it ain't so
Roll down the shades now come on let's hide
All we gotta do is just stay inside
We'll kiss the world goodbye
There's no need to go love
I know that we can find
A reason to lose the time
I know we'll find a way to stay
Stayin' in
So, time to go love
Singin' this song
Tomorrow can wait, yeah we still got today
So darling just stay with me when I'm alone
Oh time moves so slow, please baby don't go
Just say it ain't so
Already miss you before you've gone
Hope until the next time it won't be long
This is not a goodbye song
I'll see you again love
Cause I, I know that we can find
A reason to lose the time
I know we'll find a way to stay
To stay
Say it ain't so
Say it ain't so
Time to go
Just don't go
Please don't go
Say it ain't so
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh say it ain't so
No, no, no
Say it ain't so
