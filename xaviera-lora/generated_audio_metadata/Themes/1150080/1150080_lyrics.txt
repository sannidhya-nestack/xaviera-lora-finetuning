I got a strong cup of coffee, man it tastes so good
Wake my ass up like I know I should
But if I drink too much it keeps me up all night
I gotta stay cool, gotta feel alright
I got a strong cup of coffee, man it tastes so good
Wake my ass up like I know I should
But if I drink too much it keeps me up all night
I got a stick, I'm gonna feel alright
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
We talk about all the things in life
It takes a stone as it takes a bite
A way to cope with every move we make
We drink it down and we conversate
Cannot imagine where we'd be today
It's like I'll go to an unsaving grace
You'll find that it can be a piece of mind
On every corner never hard to find
A strong cup of coffee, man, it tastes so right
Love me an espresso when I know I might be needing something stronger
When the day I've had picked me up and took me to the promised land
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, everyone has got their favorite blender
Backing up and to pretend
It's kinda like our own philosophy
Larger than life, what's the deal with tea?
I got a strong cup of coffee, man it tastes so good
