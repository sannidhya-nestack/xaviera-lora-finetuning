I've got a secret, she's got a secret, got a secret, got a secret, got a secret, got a secret, got a secret, got her secret
Playing, I've been playing this game with you
For a while, do you hear what I'm saying?
Yeah, this is me in the rain, no, no, I'm not complaining
I just think it's time I did a little bit of explaining
Every time I see you, I feel my heart hit the ground
Every time I hear you, I can't help but follow the sound (the sound)
You got my love wrapped up in your fingers
And I can tell right now this is dangerous
Sitting here, bottled up emotions
You're over there controlling them like Tetris
I got a secret
Nobody knows it
I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, getting hazy
I got a secret
Nope nope nobody knows it
I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, getting hazy
I got a secret
Going crazy
I've got a secret, I've got a secret, I've got a secret
Crush
I've got a high school girl crush on you
I do, I do, do you?
Feel the same way that I do
Crush
Crush
I've got a secret
Nobody knows it
I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, you getting hazy, I got a secret
Nope nope nobody knows it, I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, you getting hazy
I got a secret, she got a secret, she got a secret
Heart, you got my heart and don't even know it
Up to me I let you keep it
Baby if you could only see
I've got a secret
Nobody knows it
I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, getting hazy
I've got a secret
No, no, nobody knows it
I think I'm gonna lose it
Going crazy, getting hazy
