You are an open book that I cannot read
You are the words I do not speak
The obvious, a metaphor, everything and nothing more
But for every door that closes, I believe another opens
So let's go where the water meets the sand
And carry me and be my man
I wanna rock you in my arms
Till my days are done
Let's go
You pull me close and then you fade away
You say you're brave
But I think you're still afraid
Bare your soul, hide your heart
In every breath we will world apart
Well I've been lost and come undone
But there was never anyone but you
Where the water meets the sand
Where we left, where we began
I wanna rock you in my arms
Till my days are gone
Let's go where the water meets the sand
Where the water meets the sand
For all the life we've yet to live
With all the love we've got to give
Let's go where the water meets the sand
Carry me and be my man
I'm gonna rock you in my arms
'Til my days have gone
Where the water meets the sand
Where the water meets the sand
Where the water meets the sand
