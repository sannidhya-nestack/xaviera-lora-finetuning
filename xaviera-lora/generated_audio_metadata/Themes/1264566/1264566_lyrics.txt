The nature of love is self-abandonment, not clinging to oneself, throwing yourself out,
as in for example in basketball you're always getting rid of the ball. You say to the other
fellow have a ball, see? And that keeps things moving. That's the nature of life.
So in this idea then everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality.
Not God in a politically kingly sense, but God in the sense of being the self,
the deep down basic whatever there is. And you're all that, only you're pretending you're not.
The deep down basic whatever there is and you're all that.
