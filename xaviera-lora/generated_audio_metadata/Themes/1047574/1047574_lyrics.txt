I've spent so much time investing in little things
Undenied the place I'm in
I've spent so much heart inventing other things
I can count my blessings now
And for now, with nothing aside, I'll be stuck in the air
And if you set me up right, I may need to fall
Fastest one, the fighting's done
Fast it comes, too far to run
And nothing counts like this
And nothing ends like this
And my God, it's getting late for a walk in the park
And if you set it up right, it may need to fall
Last last one, the fighting's done
Fast it comes, too far to run
Last last one, the fighting's done
And nothing counts like this
And nothing bends like this
And nothing counts like this
And nothing bends like this (When we're sinking)
There's falling, hope for breaking
Through the ending, through the dying
In the ocean, on the swaying
Watch you leaving, with me left inside
The calming, and the praying
And the arrow isn't playing
And it's sounding like a warning
I'm not dreaming and it's breaking it up
The timing isn't starting, isn't stopping
While we're moving and it's quiet while it's storming
And the shadows have come in this place and something has revealed
That the gardens and the forests and the seasons are becoming simply nothing and it's breaking my heart
