I wanna look at you like I once did
See all the things I could not deny
Wanna take hold of your hand
Prove to you I'm a better man
Bones they break
Hearts they ache
But baby I'll make'em brand new
Lies they hurt
Sorry's just a word
Baby I'll make us brand new
Wanna go for a walk through the fields
Lay down with you watch it all slip on by
But I know I can't get that back
Said you were mine, I wasn't happy with that
Don't say bread, hot steak
But baby I'll make them brand new
Last day hurt, sorry just a word
Baby I'll make this brand new
Don't say break, hot state
But baby I'll make'em brand new
Lies they heard, sorry just a word
Baby I'll make us brand new
Home stay great, heart stay ache
But baby I'll make'em brand new
Life ain't hard, start just a word
Baby I'll make us brand new
