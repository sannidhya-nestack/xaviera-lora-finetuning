I'm sending out a message
To anybody listening
I just want you to believe
What your heart is saying
Devote yourself to something
I feel the courage rising
And watch the flowers grow
All around you
Free, free
I wish we all could find
A pattern to unwind
The path of freedom
Freedom, imagine such a world for me and you
So tell me what's your passion?
What makes your heartbeat lighter?
Take a look inside your soul
And you'll find the answer
Don't compare yourself to anyone
your path is not their path
There is no one just like you
So be who
You are free, free
I wish we all could find
A bed and two one one
The path of freedom, freedom
Imagine such a world for me and you
Yeah, it made just such a world for me and you, oh yeah
Free, free
I wish we all could find
A pattern to unwind
The path of freedom, freedom
Imagine such a world for me and him
Oh yeah
Imagine such a world for me and you
