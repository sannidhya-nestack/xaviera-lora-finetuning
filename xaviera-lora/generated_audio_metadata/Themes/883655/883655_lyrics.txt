Lies are little fires
Look at these girls, so glamorous
They click their heels up and down the walk of fame
They laughing loud like they run this town
All night they look for the golden star with my name
Good luck with that
See I'm off the map
But you got your ways I can tell
You're getting closer in the ride
Neighborhood, but you're knocking at the wrong door
All of you pretty little things
You want a piece of me
But I'm so busy burning it down
And you say you're getting hot
But I already got lots of little fires
Little fires to put out
That thing you heard from a little bird
It felt so good when you let it go to your head
But don't think too much, it's just a crush
You know it's probably best we never met
And you never knew who
The real truth
Cause if you did it would set off all your alarms
And I know just what would happen next
You never wanna go home
And you bring in little things
You want a piece of me
But I'm so busy burning it down
And you say you're getting high but I
Already got lots of little fires
Little fires to put out
Oh yeah
Everywhere I go yeah
Lots of little fires
Little fire, little fire, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little, little fire, little, little, little, little, little fire (Lights a little fires) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire) (Fire)
But I think that I've got lots of little fires
Lots of little fires to put out
I've got to deal with the fear of the fire
The fear
Pull out all your little fires
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
We're taking the fire, we're taking the fire, we're taking the fire
Light your little fire, oh, yeah
