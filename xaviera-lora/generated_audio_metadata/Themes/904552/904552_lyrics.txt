Here you are, dressed in white
And may I say, you look so beautiful tonight
It's our first dance as man and wife
And as I hold you now I realize
That forever is right here in my arms
And right here in my heart is where you'll always stay
And forever is a dream come true
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with you
Oh baby
I had no doubt
I had no fear
I always knew
You'd be the one standing here
I smile through happy tears
Knowing you'll be there to love me through the years
And forever is right here in my arms
And right here in my heart is where you'll always stay
And forever is
Is a dream come true
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with you
I have been waiting so long to make you mine
I swear there will never be
No there will never be
A mountain we can't climb
And so I smile through happy tears
Knowing you'll be there to love me through the years
And forever is right here in my arms
And right here in my heart is where you'll always stay
And forever is a dream come true
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with you
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
With you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
