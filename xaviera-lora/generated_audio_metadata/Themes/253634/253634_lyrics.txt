Gonna be a rapper
Gonna be a superstar
Gonna buy flashy cars
I'm on the first flight to Mars
Walk that shit
I got a little story, it goes like this
It's another white rapper taking a risk
I'm out on a limb, my chances are slim
The future looks stiff as white boys ain't in
So where do I begin if I ain't got no love
I try to be gangster but I ain't no thug
I'm a herd from the'burbs who likes to cross words
If you saw me on stage you might think I'm a nerd
Outcast from the herd homie
I ain't skirted, I get busy on the mic way ahead of the curve
Been at it since my adolescence, still solo
I do my own promos, take my own photos
You probably think I'm local for coming this far
Some say my style is wack and I'll never be a star
But that's fuel for the fire inside
My underground mind where our worlds collide
I shake the earth, disrupt the tides
Grab a hold that I might freestyle some jive
I never won a battle but I always survive
Reappear out the blue but look you dead in the eyes
Cause I'm back like Friday night
Spittin' jams at a paratrue slam
Who got a light now? I'm fired up
Committed to get it clunk, I should call 50 Cent, I need to learn how to stunt
I'm gonna be a walker, gonna be a superstar
Gonna buy flashy cars, I'm on the first flight to Mars
If you talk that shit you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit you need to walk that Shit good
I got another stroke, goes like this, I'm a ill lyricist with a twist
Supreme, breaking out of quarantine, activate my poetry
I'm speaking openly until you notice me
Through the shadows of these battlegrounds
Kings fall to their knees and beg please
Till I declare a feast, but what is it that you really want?
I won't fight
I never came out cause white men can't jump
Now in the back of your mind you think I'm out of line
Crackers can't rhyme so you're just a waste of time
Thanks for the info boost
Haters hate steal from the goal and fake clash with the heavyweights
Broke ass got no cash to calculate
Or a female to help me ejaculate
Drip drop you like the way I saturate
PAs on stage at the masquerade
I got vision paranoid superstitious
Searching for riches to justify my own existence
Served my sentence 24 years in
I invested to the end my next life begins
I'm gonna be a rapper
Why change, I'm humbling down to rebel dog, I'm doing my thing
I'm true to this game, I never spit at the same
And that's why you gon' remember the name, Brick Adams
I'm gonna be a rapper
Gonna be a superstar
Gonna buy flashy cars
I'm on the first leg tomorrow
If you talk that shit, you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit, you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit, you need to walk that shit good
So now that you know the name, you can try to pass judgment but I ain't gonna change
I'm dedicated to my craft, I'll make the speakers blast
I'm on your ass just making it shake, to a funky beat break
You wanna listen to what was written by me and my ambition
Spitting bricks made of atoms, I'm legendary turning truth to anthems, mom shack to a manch
I'm gonna be a rapper, gonna be a superstar
Gonna buy flashy cars,'cause I'm on the first leg tomorrow
If you're soft that shit you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit, you need to walk that shit
If you talk that shit, you need to walk that shit good
