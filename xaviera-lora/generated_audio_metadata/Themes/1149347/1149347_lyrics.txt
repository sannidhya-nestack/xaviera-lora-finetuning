Du du du du, du du du du, du du du du, du du du du, du du du du, du du du du, du du du, du du du, du du du, Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Tu Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du DuDu Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du You You You You You You You You You You You You
Hellig är hver flamme du har tvett
Og hver livhör engel du har sendt til oss
Dine lyder
Vår vi går fra tid till tid
Yeah, for every sin you think he shrugged off, uh
I hope he had a little talk to God, huh
Get ready for your eternal fall, huh
Let's bow our heads as I send him off, bah-bah
Pray for him, pray for him
Send him on his way, I hope he prayed for him, huh
Pray for him, pray for him
Beyond the world got a little plan for him
Hope the afterlife got a blessing for us
the present times got curses for us
Navigating up and down dark alleys
Not ready for that shit that gave me knots in my belly
Face to face with death I probably chew his face
Hell's taste in my mouth spit it in your face
Running reckless that was'07
Couldn't give a fuck about hell or heaven
Pick when I was hoping the beef was over
You tried to pull a gun on me I ran him over
That was confirmation I'm a maniac
Go against the bully just to leave him nameless
You raped your girlfriend and she got pregnant
Every time she trying to leave you be acting ignorant
Couple years later she finally left you
She fucked around and got herself a real dude
You try to stop her moving on your ego's bruised
Fuck her acting like she got some to prove
I'm too psycho for your coward death threats
Best bet, you the one to die first
I should've killed you when I had a chance to
Your baby's pretty smile is what saves you
How ironic the one you brought into life would sin
In saving you from paying debts or your sins
Pray for, pray for
You should probably worship me and pray for
Have a holiday and celebrate her
For the life you have you owe me a favor
Pray for him, pray for him
Send him on his way I hope you pray for him
Pray for him, pray for him
The underworld got a little plan for him
Seven white candles, solid gold candlestick in the tabernacle
When your spirit's fading and your body's trying to let go
Hoping you can cleanse every single dirt you live for
As I'm sitting reminiscing on my missions
Fantasies of blood spilling as an adolescent
Families will start singing when I give a lesson
Frankly I don't got feelings hope you had your blessings
Count it up, cause I don't give a fuck
My blood's boiling up, hot temper to erupt
I'm a wolf to you motherfucking sheep's bleat
Anthony Hopkins, I silence the lamb
Straight to your throat
Skin you alive, show a bitch a funeral in a sheepskin coat
If I find no iveness for the blood spill
Save me a seat in hell if that's God's will
Pray for him, pray for him
Send him on his way, I hope he pray for him
Pray for him, pray for him
Beyond the world got a little plan for him
Pray for him, pray for him
Send him on his way, I hope he pray for him
Pray for him, pray for him
Beyond the world got a little plan for him
My little potato shroom
My little potato shroom
My little potato shroom
My little potato shroom
