The one ya fire
When you hear dem a tune ya you can't stay steady
dem a tune ya say if you have a strong steady and a rap steady
And that's how you go dready dready
Make we drop dem lyrics ya inna dem head
Make we drop dem lyrics ya inna dem head
Drop dem lyrics ya inna dem head
We drop dem lyrics ya inna dem head
Dem can't take it
What a rhythm bad like a fire
Nobody wants to play with us we're radiation
Best press the trigger fifty times without even hesitating
When I get so mad on tracks clearly I'd be levitating
Listen to that bredda's voice he's clearly fucking devastating
City and guilds are fabricated power stations
So slick on the wheels can't educate my dedication
Spit on the shield and medicate with meditation
There's shit on the fields let's express the education
I'm building nominations, escape the tax evasion
Materialize aspirations, avoid annihilation
Don't jet to destinations, make tracks that rock the nation
Most hate is the occupation, don't hate getting occupation
Bad n boy dem a say dem a it
But when they see me and they see me matic
Seventeen shoot and me got in a ditch
No make me boss it, mm-hmm, um shot
Why you say you want a clash?
But you want mossy idiot, pap-pap-pap-pap
So me lick two shot, ha quick quick quick
Him a jump, him a skip and start to panic
Me tell him to move, show him the exit, nawanya
Me am emergency, fist a pit
Mi sit down inna mi yard mi dust and bun some cranny
Babylon smell it and dem just can't stand it
That's why dem tell the government fi ban it
Now the people demand it
Bad n boy dem a say dem a hit
But when they see me and they see me matic
Seventeen copper shot mi got inna mi clip
Boom shot, ya hear that?
Bad n boy dem a say dem a eat
But when they see me and they see me matik
Seventeen shoot and me got in a ditch
No make me boss it, boomshak
Why you say you want a clash
But you want mosi idiot
