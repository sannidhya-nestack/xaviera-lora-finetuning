You are someone else's lover
I thought you were mine
I hoped you were mine
But that love
Was for another
It was not my time
I was not what you'd find
Can't stop these feelings that well inside me
Can't hold them back even if I try
And now in my December
Ooh, I remember
There are times I'll think about you
Looking for what the future is past
At those times fight back those feelings
You were never mine
No, never mind
But when I think back
It's those days
Not something I can push away
And now in my
December
Ooh, I remember
You, oh pine, do you think about me?
Or is it a dream only I can see?
Will it ever be time to remember?
You could have been mine
You could have been mine
And I can't make you love me
There are no words, there is no rhyme
And now in my December
Ooh, I remember
You are someone else's lover
You were never mine
No, never mine
