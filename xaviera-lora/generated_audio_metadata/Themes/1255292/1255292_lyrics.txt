There is something I should tell you
I don't care now that I'm sober
You can charm me with a smile
I'd rather be drunk and fighting all the time
I don't like being on the level
Back in them hills yeah I can hide
I maintain a state of confusion
It's easier than being the star of your illusion
This kind of love will fool you at the start
This kind of love should've left it at the bar
This kind of love will hurt you nonetheless
This kind of love is the fear of a bleeding heart
Well I guess it's hard to do
To pack out bags with a sense of humor
I paid the rent while you blew the bomb
Odds on when the landlord comes
He won't get the joke
I won't miss you on Sunday
You roll your eyes, I heard that before
I'll come back with my tail between my legs
Actions are lighter than words
Like my mama said
This kind of love will fool you at the start
This kind of love should've left it at the bar
This kind of love will hurt you nonetheless
This kind of love is the fear of a bleeding heart
This kind of love will fool you at the start
This kind of love should've left it at the bar
This kind of love will hurt you nonetheless
This kind of love is the fear of a bleeding heart
Of the fear of a bleeding heart
