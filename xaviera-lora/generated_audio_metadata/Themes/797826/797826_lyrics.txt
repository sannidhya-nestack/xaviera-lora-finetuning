The song I sing comes from my soul
The chord I play is umbilical
The words I use come from my heart
'Cause you've been there right from the start
Oh my mama, happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama, happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama, happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama happy everyday
There was a time I was knee high
And you were big you were everything
But now you're small and I'm so tall
But does it matter? No, not at all
Oh my mama, happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama, happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama
Happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama
Happy every day
Oh my mama
Happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama
Happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama
Happy Mother's Day
Oh my mama
Happy every day
Oh my mama
Happy every day
