Another happy hour has come
And each one is better than the last
When we get to share some air
Somewhere to relax
And cheers
To happy spirits resting in your home
And cheers
Cheers to you
So take another bottle down
It's pouring like a waterfall tonight
And if you have a story pass it on
We'll cultivate the best of life
With our time
Cause it's short and sweet
And creatures need some comfort
So cheers, cheers to you
And here in our circle of friends
There's a good good vibration
And when I fall in with you
There's an instant gratification
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Cheers
To happy spirits resting in your home
Cheers
To your good health and overflow
Cheers
To creature comfort here
Cheers
To you
