You were here again last night
Like you'd never been away
Lying here with me
Just talking, whispering a dream
Tears will never dry
These moments are so real
When you wake me from my sleep
I hear you whispering a dream
I hear it in your voice, see it in your eyes
Love that has no end, helping me pretend
You'll still be by my side everywhere I go
Watching over me, watching over me
And when I fall asleep
You'll be whisperin', whisperin' a dream
Please come again tonight
And whisper me a dream
You'll still be by my side everywhere I go
Watching over me, watching over me
And when I fall asleep
You'll be whispering, whispering a dream
Please come again tonight
And whisper me a dream
You were here again last night
Like you've never been away
Please come back again tonight
Please whisper, whisper me a dream
Please come back again tonight
Please whisper, whisper me a dream
