Simply wild, you and I
We've been dancing the whole night
Body see, you and me so wild
What's the time? Never mind, I'm ready to spend my life by the sea, you're in me so why?
Simply man, that's not bad
But if you're in, just raise your head
We all are to this and touch the sky
What's the time? Never mind
I'm ready to spend my life
By the sea, you and me, so what?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad we're enough
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad we're enough
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad we're enough
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's not bad, it's not bad
Simply why, you and I, we've been dancing the whole night
Body see, you and me, so why
Watch the time, never mind, I'm ready to spend my life by the sea, you're in me, so why?
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad way to know
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad way to know
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad way to know
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's a bad, it's a bad
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad way to love
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's a bad, it's a bad, it's a bad way to love
Maybe we, maybe we, maybe we're too young
It's a bad, it's a bad, It's a bad way to love
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, you're mine
It's a bad, it's a bad
