Come on
Ooh-ooh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
Tonight the river spills down and out
But up to kill the pole
Keeps me whole
I cut the corners back
Now we wait for the attack
The bull rages on
You're stuck with what you said
Now you're closer to the end
We're sold on our own
I am a stranger here
Carried out by what I fear
We're all on our own
You are trying but they intend to make it hard
Telling hopes to reach the stars
I'm faking as I'm reaching nowhere
Something feels like we're all ending
We might be the last ones landing
I'm overwhelmed today
Practising what I will say
The curse keeps me calm
I try to make it there
Heavy heart, it's finally happening
Pull back again
And once again I'm past him now
Failing hopes to reach the stars
I'm vacant as I'm reaching nowhere
Something feels like
We're all ending
We might be the last ones landing
Uh-huh
Don't let it
Uh-huh
Don't let it
Uh-huh
Don't let it go
Uh-huh
Don't let it
Uh-huh
Don't let it
Uh-huh
There still is hope
Telling hopes to reach the stars
I'm baking as I'm reaching nowhere
Something feels like we're all ending
We might be the last ones landing
