The first time you smiled at me
I knew I was yours
Then you looked into my eyes
And you unlocked the door
To that special part of your heart
That soft warm place
You've saved for me all these years
I found my way home, it took so long to find you
And I'm so glad you were there to welcome me home
I traveled so far, searching for the truth
When you opened up your arms, I found my way home
The feeling is so intense
Each time we touch
Now I keep pinching myself
Can someone love me this much
But everyday you find another way
To make me feel
What I was missing all those years
I found my way home
It took so long to find you
And I'm so glad you were there to
Welcome me home
I've traveled so far
Searching for the truth
When you opened up your arms
I found my way home
Before you, life was two
It's too complicated for me to understand
But tonight, I realize how easy love can be
Between a woman and a man
I found my way home, it took so long to find you
And I'm so glad you were there to welcome me home
I traveled so far searching for the truth
When you opened up your arms, I found my way home
Hey, I found my way home
