People prayin' to their God, screamin' "I'll save us"
Lend us a sign so we can believe in the amazing
No matter what they design, in order to deceive
There will always be something for the people to believe
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
When it becomes suitable they blame us
You fix the problem player and you instantly famous
So I thought I'd take a little time today
To explain how Jalan Estreit got washed away
Now one morning of one dawn
In the kingdom of Babylon
Lived a dreadlock Rastaman who lived by the pond
He raised two daughters and conceived one son
He taught his girls to be sweet and his son to be strong
Striped red the Lager
Sip and speak to his son
He advised the ways of keeping his eyes on the sun
Take time to handle business and take time for fun
Cause one day you will have joy and the next it will be gone
The son was disbelieved he didn't understand his pops
So by the pun he decided to hit the water with rocks
His pops saw that he paid no attention
To the power he was passing so again he mentioned
People praying to their God screaming I'll save us
Lend us a sign so we can believe in amazing
No matter what they design in order to deceive
There will always be something for the people to believe
The people praying to their God screaming I'll save us
Lend us a sign so we can believe in amazing
No matter what they design in order to deceive
There will always be something for the people to believe
Pop said to his son do you know Jah rock
His son said no but at night he can see that bright star
So the dad said good that's the star of concern
No matter how close you get you'll never get burned
That's the star that keep us going day and night
Now you can see it in the shade but you have to focus when it's bright
He said it's a set up a complete soul system
Jah mouth Jah eye
Jah ears for Jah listening
Boley he said son when I'm at work stand behind and follow me
Pay attention to how I function how it's done properly
Everything I perform Jah I will approve
That doesn't mean I'll always win but it's guaranteed I'll never lose
Today all trespassers washed away
All done in an instant too quick for replay
I am well prepared for Jah judgment day
To cash in my merry play Jah blessing match
The people praying to their God screaming I'll save us
Lend us a sign so we can believe in amazing
No matter what they design in order to deceive
There will always be something for the people to believe
The people praying to their God screaming I'll save us
Lend us a sign so we can believe in amazing
No matter what they design in order to deceive
There will always be something for the people to believe
Yeah, this your boy Sean Lapp
I love talking about Jah and how Jah blessed me, you understand?
So I thought I'd pass the message along to you
Hey, hey you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
The frequency and the rhymes
Is a tool for instructions, you heard?
Updates are necessary
So that the mind can properly function
Jah blessed me to perform
Different tasks at different times
Mostly touch the people with the sound
And even though it increases my rapid climb
They owe me
So they have to repay
You get me?
