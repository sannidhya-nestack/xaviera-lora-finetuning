When the light goes out, you're completely in the dark
You might fall on the ground, not go too far
Or you can let yourself go and develop all your senses
And you could find yourself suddenly still running and dancing
You never stop learning
Especially when you have lost the higher road
Maybe it's never been the right one
Maybe we went wrong with everything
Drowning to these frequencies I know
Only as we did madness and honesty
We're back in the game from the main door
We're riding the wave of this new strange alchemy
When the time is right we may dare to move forward
To get out of the closet
And embrace the sunlight again
You never stop learning
We're not licensed to start the race
This bridge is more unsafe than we thought
We should accelerate
Thrown into these frequencies I know
On the edge between madness and honesty
We're back in the game from the main door
We're riding the wave of this new strange alchemy
You never stopped learning
Especially when you had lost the high road
Maybe it's never been the right one
Maybe we went wrong with everything
Thrown into discrepancies I know
On the aspic with madness and honesty
We're back in the game from the main door
We're riding the wave of this new and strange alchemy
