Woke up this morning couldn't sleep
How we got here baby please
All these secrets got so loud
Now you're lost in this bitter crowd
Told you once it was my bad
Didn't mean to make you sad
Every word's a cut so deep
In this bed where we can't sleep
Loyal hearts start to wane
Tears falling just like rain
I was lost, touched the flame
And now I wear this cloak of shame
Told you once it was my bad
Didn't mean to make you sad
Every word took us so deep
In this bed where we can't sleep
Know you're hurt
Broken trust, wondering if it was just lust
Tried so hard but lost control
Now it's hollow, where's our soul?
So we dance around the truth
Mirror cracked, lost are you
Can we mend what's torn apart?
Will you mend my broken heart?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
