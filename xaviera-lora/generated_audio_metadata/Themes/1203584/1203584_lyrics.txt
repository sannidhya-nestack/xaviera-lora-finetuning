It's time for us to walk away
From the things that break us down
We need to know what this life means at the end
I need to realize I'm not alone
Though at times this life gets lonely
There is something
Bigger than all I can know
So when I look to the horizon
I want to know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
Is it a part of who I am?
All I want is a second chance
So I can see my baby grow
I hope with all my heart she'll be alright
But the future isn't clear and I may never know
To the horizon
I wanna know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
Is it a part of who I am?
Now when I look to the horizon
I wanna know, I've got to know where it ends
And when I see the rainbow in front of me
I know it's a part of who I am
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I know
I'm a part of it all
