Living on the ground
Living on the ground with my head high
Living on the ground
I'm living on the ground with my head high
How should I take the world
I'm taking it far too long
Then why they say
My hands are too weak
I got a calling from inside
It's like I am magnetized
When I splash my anger
All good stuff go outside
Ay-ya-ya, ay-ya, ay-ya-ya
I expose your blatant rigidity
Ay-ya-ya, ay-ya, ay-ya-ya
Expose my lack of confidence
Walking on the road, tripping on a small hole
Then I realized that I think I know nothing
Walking on the road, tripping on a small hole
Then I realized that I think I know nothing
Flying on a cloud
I control my mind
I have been a clown
And now it's time to
Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, and cry
I am magnetized on all the good stuff
I, I, I
Magnetized
Precious is this desire
Precious is this fire
Precious is this soothing touch
Precious is this desire
Precious is this fire
Precious is this soothing touch
That I needed so much
Precious is this life
When it's mine it's all mine
I can share it
Ah yeah, yeah yeah
