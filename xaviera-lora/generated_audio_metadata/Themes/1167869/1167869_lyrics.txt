Hold up now where you going I just wanna see you moving
Inky body tell a story to the rhythm of the music
My name is Collin Rich and I wanna tell you something new
I get busy making do what it do
I got the word play on the worst day make em thirsty
Bad girls want the good deal on their birthdays
I don't really have the time to waste
On the grind all I do is skate
Talk to em
I like the way that you move
And I'm tryna see what you do
Once I get you in the right mood
What do's you got to lose
Girls shake yo ass about them jeans (shake yo ass about them jeans)
Girls shake yo ass about them jeans (girls shake yo ass about them jeans)
Let's go
Slow down mama let me ease you in
The way things are going I can't be your friend
See back then we were cool you're older now
And don't you know your mama raised a golden child and by the ocean
You should come and take a visit (yeah)
New place in Long Beach, come see how I'm living
And we be in the living room kicking it and chilling
Rolling up good, we getting high to the ceiling
So make it like a soccer team and just come kick it
The way you body move, you so talented and gifted
So talented and gifted, so talented and gifted
I like the way that you move
And I'm tryna see what you do
Once I get you in the right mood
What do you got to lose?
Girls shake yo ass about them jeans
Girls shake yo ass about them jeans
Let's go
