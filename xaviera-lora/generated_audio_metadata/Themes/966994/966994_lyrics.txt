You're a bad habit, I need to quit
I've been too wasted on you
I'd overdo it, then I'd feel like shit
I've been under the influence
You're using me just like I'm using you
I'm sobering up I can see I am wasted on you
I am wasted on you
I am wasted on you
I am wasted on you
We hit the roof and I overdid it on you
I learned to see through the double vision
Every sip that I take
Another bad decision
You're using me
That's nothing new
It's messed up
But it's just what you do
And I sit, get my tiny
We sit on you
We sit on you
We said our hero
We said our hero
