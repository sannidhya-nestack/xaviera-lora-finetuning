I'll tell you a story
Child of mine
A long past I'll tell you
In my time
I made some mistakes, yeah
I know you can see
Learn from these lessons
My legacy
In life you make your own prize
Listen to your father's advice
If I could lead you
Down life's road
Follow my footsteps, but walk in your own
These words that I leave you will have to suffice
When I'm long gone, you'll have to think twice
In life you pay your own price
Listen to your father's advice
If I could do it all again
The ones I hurt I'll mend
Love unconditionally
Forever we'll be free
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
So this is my story, child of mine
Make your own choices, and you'll be just fine
In life, you pay your own price
Listen to your father's advice
Listen to your father's advice
