You said you'd be home
Three hours ago
You say you're working
How am I to know
The kids are sleeping
At least they can rest
Tossin' and turnin' with visions in my head
All of the night I wonder where you are
On my achin' heart
Sometimes it's better not to know
I wake at every
Car just passing by
Expecting it to stop
And your footsteps every time
3 am I thought
Check our account
She'll keep dancing mister
Till your pockets are emptied out
All of the night I wonder where you are
On my aching heart
Sometimes it's better not to know
All of the night I wonder where you are
On my aching heart
Sometimes it's better
All of the night I wonder where you are
On my aching heart
Sometimes it's better not to know
Not to know
Not to know
Not to know
Sometimes it's better not to know
