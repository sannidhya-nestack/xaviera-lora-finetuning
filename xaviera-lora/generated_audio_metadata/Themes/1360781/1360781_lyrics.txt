Ah, ah, uh-huh, ah, ah
Snow's falling, lights are twinkling
Bright bells are jingling, what a magical night
Kids are giggling, holding joy in their hands
Laughter and cheer spreading across the land
Hey oh, it's New Year's time
We're laughing, singing, feeling fine
Hey oh, it's New Year's time
Let's kick it off with fun and shine
Gifts all wrapped up under the tree
Frosties dancing, come and see
Hands together, hearts full of cheer
The New Year's here, let's spread some cheer
Hey-oh, it's New Year's time
We're laughing, singing, feeling fine
Hey-oh, it's New Year's time
Let's kick it off with fun and shine
Twinkle lights, snowflakes in the air
Giggles everywhere, love everywhere
Raise your voice, shout, "Happy New Year !"
The magic's here, it's finally here
Hey-oh, it's New Year's time
We're laughing, singing, feeling fine
Hey-oh, it's New Year's time
Let's kick it off with fun and shine
