Too many phone calls late into the night
Gotta be a better way to make things right
You and me baby gotta find some time and go
What we need is some round the clock touching
A few days for some lock the door loving
A few more cause that won't be enough you know
How soon can you be ready to go?
Now there's a lot of miles between me and you
Well let's see what kind of flights they got
Vegas or Miami in the deep end of the pool
With you we're going somewhere high doing something cool
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You been living East Coast, I been living West
Time to get together and decompress
Have a few drinks and get undressed real slow
Well how soon
Can you be ready to go?
There's a lot of miles between me and you
Let's see what kind of flights they got
Vegas or Miami in the deep end of the pool
With you we're going somewhere high
Doing something cool
Make a few days feel like forever
Only thing that could make it better
You and me building a life together
Wherever you wanna go
Now there's a lot of miles between me and you
Let's see what kind of flights they got
Vegas or Miami in the deep end of the pool
With you we're going somewhere high
Doing something cool, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Doing something cool
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
