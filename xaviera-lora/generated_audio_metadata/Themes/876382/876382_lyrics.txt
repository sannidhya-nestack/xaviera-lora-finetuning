Melody, hum another one for me
When the words escape your memory
I'll still be sweet on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, melody
Walking away once was too much for me
Now I wanna come back and never leave
Give you nothing but the truth
But they found me guilty of loving you
I have nowhere to hide
And if I could turn back time
I'd do it all over again
That is why
I have no alibi
Now don't you think it's time
That we give this thing another try
Melody, you've always been there for me
Yet you still remain a mystery
Keep me searching for another clue
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Melody
All along you've always been right on time
And all night long you've been on my mind
Now what else could I do
When they found me guilty of love and of you
I had nowhere to hide
And if I could turn back time
I'd do it all over again
And that is why I have no alibi
Now don't you think it's time
That we give this thing another try
I tried to pretend with all of my friends
That nothing was wrong
That I wasn't missing you
But that just wasn't true
They knew it all along
They found me guilty of loving you
I had nowhere to hide
And if I could turn back time
I'd do it all over again
That is why I have
Now don't you think it's time
That we give this thing another try
Oh melody, melody
Don't you think it's time
