Hi, my name is Jimmy McGurk, I was born and raised in the bay
I worked in Jack Toupee's, I ran along the docks in the quay
I'm Allian in the hand, Thomas O'Shannah and I'm taking a ride in the town
Down for a pint while I just might be part of some steak and a round
Kelly I'm coming over
Kelly I'm coming over
Maybe I'll die as a holy war just west of Union Square
I wasn't the type to kill you for cash and always love me there
Behind the bar you're open fightin' the lies you're talkin' tonight
The day gone down you're passin' around hopin' you'll catch a ride
Oh Kelly, oh Kelly, Kelly, oh now Kelly, Kelly, oh Kelly
Kelly you're comin' over, Kelly you're comin' over
A glass of gin, we all fit in, we're dancing nose around
The answer's yeah, yeah, don't you dare,'cause I be sitting you down
Verizon proves, Harris-Potter's always holding me back
I'll be limey, no, I'll be gobbly, let's just take it with that
Oh, Kelly
Oh, Kelly
Oh, Kelly
Oh, now, Kelly
Kelly
Oh, Kelly
Kelly coming over
Kelly coming over
Yeah, they're coming over
Yeah, they're coming over
Hey, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh kill it, oh kill it
Kill it all now, kill it
Kill it, oh kill it
Kill it comin' over
Kill it comin' over
Oh kill it comin' over
Kill it comin' over
