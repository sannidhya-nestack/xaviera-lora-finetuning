Keep my soul at rest
Help me be easy and take a deep breath
I know it's hard to give up control
It's your soul in the end
A little faith still goes a long way
So let go and let you in
And have patience
Fill my heart with truth and love
Let them see through me all three in one
I wanna please you and do your will
When I put you first then I'll have learned
How to grow by standing still
Show me the ways, the ways of love
Where mercy and grace fall like the rain above
It never was right, when you're by my side
Forever and always, all through my life
Show me the place, the place I long for
We're all time and space, don't matter much anymore
The present's right now, the past was back then
The future will come, don't let it ruin the moment
ain't that what life is, a series of moments
To show the ways of love
Put my mind and body at ease
They can be your best friend or your worst enemy
Give me the strength to hope and believe
That one day I will find a way
To truly be at peace
Show me the ways
The ways of your love
Where mercy and grace
Fall like the rain above a never-ending shrine
When you're by my side
Forever and always
All through my life
Show me the place, the place I long for
We're all time and space, don't matter much anymore
The present's right now, the past was back then
The future will come, don't let it ruin the moment
ain't that what life is, a series of moments
When life gets busy, help me to slow it down
The ways of the world are not meant for me to hold on
When life gets heavy, make it light
So I can carry it around
The weight of the world is not meant to be for anyone
Show me the ways, the ways of your love
Where mercy and grace fall like the rain above
It never runs dry when you're by my side
Forever and always all through my life
Show me the place, the place I'm looking for
We're all time and space, don't matter much anymore
The present's right now, the past is back then
The future will come, don't let it ruin the moment
ain't that what life is? A series of moments
To show the ways of love
The ways of love
The ways of love
