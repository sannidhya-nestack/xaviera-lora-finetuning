Fa-la-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la -la-la-la-la-la
Don't have to see it
To believe it
I hear the sleigh bells
From half a world away
Don't need to touch it
I can feel it
Don't need December
To make my holiday
Beneath the northern stars
It's always snowing in my heart
But you can take the ornaments back to the attic
Take the seasons greetings off the downtown streets
You can take the candy canes and while you're at it
Take the carols, take the presents
Take down every light you see
But you can't take the Christmas out of me
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Don't have to ease into the season
24 /7 living in a wonderland
And when the jingling
Stops ring-a-ling-a-ling
Every song will keep on singing in my head
My cup of Christmas cheer
Keeps my spirits up all year
Now you can take the ornaments back to the attic
Take the season's greetings off the downtown streets
You can take the candy canes and while you're at it
Take the carols, take the presents
Take down every light you see
But you can't take the Christmas out of me
You can take the ornaments back to the attic
Take the season's greetings off the downtown streets
You can take the candy canes and while you're at it
Take the carols, take the presents
Take down every light you see
Now I'm as far from the North Pole as I can be
But you can never take the Christmas out of me
Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la, fa la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la
