Staring at the ceiling, counting endless sheep
Lost in shadows drowning in the deep
A heart that's heavy, a soul that's torn
Haunted by memories of love forlorn
Empty bottles scattered ashes on the floor
A prisoner of the past craving something more
Vodka and cigarettes
Holding on to past regrets
It's time to let go
It's time to let go
Breaking free from chains a heavy load
Finding strength within to walk this road
Days turning to nights, a never ending blur
Drowning in sorrow, a painful slur
Yearning for a future, a brighter start
Healing broken pieces, my new shattered heart
But fear holds tight, a suffocating grip
Trapped in shadows, all I said reslipped
Fuck your insecurites
Holding on to past regrets
It's time to let go
It's time to let go
Breaking free from chains of heavy load
Finding strength within to walk this road
Days turning to nights, a never ending blur
Drowning in sorrow, a painful slur
Yearning for the future, the brighter start
Healing broken pieces, bending shattered heart
The fear holds tight, a suffocating grip
Trapped in shadows, all our slippery slip
Vodka and cigarettes, holding on to past regrets
It's time to let go, it's time to let go
Breaking free from chains of heavy load
Finding strength within to walk this road
A flicker of hope, a gentle light
Breaking through the darkness shining ever bright
With courage as my honour I'll face the day
Leaving behind the shadows come what may
No more drowning in sorrow, no more tears to cry
A new chapter begins, I'll learn to fly
Vodka and cigarettes
Holding on to past regrets
It's time to let go
It's time to let go
Breaking free from chains of heavy load
Finding strength within to walk this road
Vodka and cigarettes
For God's sake, correct
The shape of this heart of love
A girl of hope, a gentle light
Breaking through the darkness, shining ever bright
With courage as my armor I'll face the day
Leaving behind the shadows come what may
No more drowning in sorrow, no more tears to cry
A new chapter begins, I'll learn to fly
