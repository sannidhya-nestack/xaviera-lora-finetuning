Please me, please me, please me, please me
Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me
Do we try, try, try, try
Heal me, heal me
Your life, your life, your life
Heal me, heal me
Please me, please me
Hold tight, tight, tight
You're right, nothing is easy
But do we try
Your life, love me or leave me
Will you try
Your life, to lie and deceive me
I wonder why
Hope's high, gotta believe me
We gotta try
You're right to lie and deceive me
You're right, love me or leave me
You're right, nothing is easy
Tease me
Just pick me up and turn me round
I've lost my way, I'm losing ground
No more regrets, no tears to cry
I hope the dawn brings a bluer sky
You're right, nothing is easy
But do we try?
You're right, so love me or leave me
But will you cry?
You're right, lie and deceive me
You're right, love me or leave me
You're right
Nothing is easy, tease me
Tease me, tease me, tease me
Do we try, heal me, heal me
No lie, heal me, heal me
Please me, please me
Hold tight, heal me, heal me
Nothing is easy
Nothing is easy
Love me or leave me
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Love me or leave me
Did we try?
Did we try?
Will you cry?
