When I get home for Christmas I imagine the smile
Upon your face and the twinkle in your eye
When I get home for Christmas I know you'll be surprised
When I step through the door
And kiss you on the kitchen floor
Always on the road with my piano and the bands
I go from town to town, crossing borders there's no end
A happy audience every night that keeps me strong
Reflections in my mind of you are always going on
Yeah it's a good life but it's a hard life
Seeing you just a few weeks a year
The inspiration of my work
You made
When I get home for Christmas, I imagine the smile
Upon your face and the twinkle in your eye
When I get home for Christmas, I know you'll be surprised
When I step through the door and kiss you on the kitchen floor
Home for Christmas, I'll be home
Christmas at home, it's been a long time ago
Presents under the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
This year I will be home
But you don't know
A big surprise, that's my Christmas gift
Yeah, I'll be with you
Together we're having Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus
It's the best time of year
When I get home for Christmas I imagine the smile
Upon your face and the twinkle in your eye
When I get home for Christmas I know you
Be surprised if I step through the door
And kiss you on the kitchen floor
When I get home for Christmas
I imagine the smile upon your face
And the twinkle in your eye
When I get home for Christmas
I know you'll be surprised
When I step through the door
And kiss you on the kitchen floor
