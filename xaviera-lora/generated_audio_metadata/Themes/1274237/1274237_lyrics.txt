I had a dream
In a darkened room
I found you
You serenade my heart
With bittersweet
And the love I feel is always
Everything I am
I understood
But the dreams I had won't let me be
I don't need love and I don't need love
I don't need love so long
I heard your voice
From a veil of light
How I saw you
You serenade my heart
With bittersweet
And the light I feel is all
It's everything we are
I know the truth
That I cannot face when I'm lost in you
I don't need love
I don't see the point
I don't care
All of this
I don't need love
