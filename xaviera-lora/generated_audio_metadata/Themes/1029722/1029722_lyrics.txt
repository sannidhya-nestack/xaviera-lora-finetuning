For only in night I live with pain
Only my mind will be insane
Only in time will I be the same
Life with pain, life with pain
To feel like, live like, I've got something left in this life
Is a calculated step for a devastating death
For only my health, God, shall I fall in love again
For only a friend I must comprehend
For life is a sin, to let life begin
I'm in pain again, in pain again
For only in life I live with pain
Only my mind will be insane
Only in time will I be the same
Life with pain, life with pain
Life can be a fantasy against the wall for life to only feel small
If you can only stand three feet tall for the love of it all
In life I will be standing real tall
For in life the things that I saw
To live life was some pain only to expect it again
Again
For only in life I live with pain
Only my mind will be insane
Only in time will I be the same
Life with pain, life with pain
My pain is risen from the sun
Only in life to live for fun
I feel like I'm done
Forever love in life is none
Only my heart comes from pain
A life that remains
Only for love in my life again
The heart of a soldier
To get older and older
Life with no order
Only pain to survive
Addicted to drama
The life of pain
Only to live in pain
For a life with pain
For only in life I live with pain
Only my mind will be insane
Only in time will I be the same
Life with pain, life with pain
The days of thunder, I live to wonder
For love can go under the river to fall
Only love forever is all, only for love
Life is confused, the illusion of love could be amused
Only to feel pain, to feel used
To feel used, to feel used
For only in life I live with pain
Only my mind will be insane
Only in time will I be the same
Life with pain, life with pain
