Follow me home
Follow me home
Erase the day
Erase the day
And break me up
And break me up
Hollow alone
Hollow alone
Hollow alone
Hollow alone
Follow me home
Follow me home
Erase the day
Erase the day
And break me out
And break me out
Hollow alone, hollow alone, hollow alone
Hollow alone
After all the battles fall
Get back to me in a year
But I never saw the heart
Till you made it clear
Follow me home
Follow me home
Erase the day
Erase the day
And break me up
And break me up
Hollow alone, hollow alone
Hollow alone, hollow alone
