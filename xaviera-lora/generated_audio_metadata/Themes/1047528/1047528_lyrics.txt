We're uninvited when we're healing
We're less inflicted while we're gone
The balance makes it more revealing
On the crash we made it home
For every cryer there's a reason
For every minor there's a hole
Too quickly fall right out of season for
The comfort wedging song
Bad
We can't, we saw, be careful your heart
Bad
Another word, we can't be sure
The paragraph that I was reading
Took me a minute to absorb
And then I had another feeling
I no longer love this world
To give the lost another choice
Cut up the cloth to let the voice
I'm off, most home, I let the toads
Get up, alone, be there, be yours
In the space we are, having made three hands
To find, beyond
But no one else can wait, no one else can wait
No one else can break me home
When this loving starts to play
Be on
And the cover that can take me home
Home
Bah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We came, we saw, be careful y'all
Another world, we can be sure
Together lost another choice
I'm just a boy
Caught up, but called to let the boys
