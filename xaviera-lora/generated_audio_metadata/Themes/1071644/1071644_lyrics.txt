Yeah, shout out to all the mom champs
Let's go
Raising a child can be such a blessing
Love and affection can be any weapon
I love and respect them, never neglect them
They could lose their way but only if I let them
No way Jose, no I won't let them
Absolutely not, that's out of the question
And they could make you see red like a rainbow
Still I wouldn't have it any other way though
Always a mother from Monday to Sunday
This is my job, I rip it like a runway
Is what it is, but it ain't what it seemin'
Just like my iron, I'm hot and I'm steamin'
Fuckin' and cleanin', California dreamin'
Eyes wide shut, nah, eyes wide beamin'
Move along, move along, I'm just movin' on
et about a superman, I'm a supermom
Mom champ, mom champ, do it for my mom champs
All around the world, hands up for my mom champs
Got that magic, ladies, not your average ladies
Do it on a dilly, do it for our babies
Mom champ, uh-huh, mom champ, do it for my mom champs
All around the world, hands up
But my mom chips got that magic, ladies
Not your average lady, do it on a dilly, do it for our babies
So many men hatin' on a female
That's no lie, I could give you all the details
Look with disgust now, why he lookin' sour?
Hatin' on a chick'cause she got the girl
See envy in they eyes when I pass them by
Spread my wings to the sky like a dragonfly
Every man needs a good woman behind him
I be shining when the stars are aligning
Eyes glued to the TV when my soap is on
Outside in the field catching some Pokemon
Guys wanna mock her but they can't stop her
Call me a girl, but I kick it like soccer
Coulda been a doctor, coulda been a scholar
When you make it, then they all wanna holla
In the gym on the whim and they can't sweat, huh?
Anything you could do, I can do better
Momchamp, momchamp, do it for my momchamps
All around the world, hands up for my momchamps
Got that magic, ladies, not your average ladies
Do it on a dilly, do it for our babies
Momchamp, uh-huh, momchamp, do it for my mom champs
All around the world, hands up for my momchamps
Got that magic, ladies, not your average ladies
Do it on a dilly, do it for our babies
Friends asking me, "Do you ever wonder, woman?"
With my last soul, here comes Wonder Woman
Made a lot of mistakes and this I can own up
Now I'm all grown up, I got it all sewn up
Never looking down when problems come around
This my sound, yeah this my sound
Stand by my words, back it up
I cloud I'm the queen so it seems
Give me my crown
Eager as a beaver
Hot like a fever
Stripes like a zebra
Fight like I'm Xena
I'm your addiction
Need a prescription
For my whole life
The Venezuelan vixen
That's Juliana
She do it for her Issa
Got that baby fever
That's her little diva
Fighting for her future
Making it brighter
Just like mommy she's an ultimate fighter
Momchimp, momchimp, do it for my momchimps
