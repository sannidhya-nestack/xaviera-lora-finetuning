Sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Give God the highest praise
Sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah
We've got to praise His name
Sing unto the Lord a new song
In the congregation of the saints
You ought to lift your hands and give Him praise
You oughta give him thanks
He's been so good to me (He's been so good to me)
He died on the cross at Calvary (And I'm glad I died)
He shed his blood for you and me (Thank you Jesus)
So that we can all be free (Thank you)
Now I can plainly see (Thank you)
What we need to do is praise Him (Clap your hands and give Him praise)
You ought to praise Him (Give Him praise)
You ought to praise Him (Clap your hands and give Him praise)
You ought to praise Him and don't praise Him in the sanctuary and in the firmament of His power
Praise Him for His mighty acts according to His excellent grace
I'm gonna praise Him (the Lord God Almighty)
He's worthy (He's worthy to be praised)
Yes He is (come on and praise Him)
Come on and praise Him (the Lord God Almighty)
Come on and praise Him (He's worthy to be praised)
Somebody sing hallelujah (I'm gonna praise Him, hallelujah)
Somebody sing hallelujah (He's worthy to be praised)
Somebody sing hallelujah (I'm gonna praise Him)
Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah to be praised
He's worthy, he's worthy, he's worthy, he's worthy
To be praised, to be praised, to be praised, to be praised
To be praised
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
