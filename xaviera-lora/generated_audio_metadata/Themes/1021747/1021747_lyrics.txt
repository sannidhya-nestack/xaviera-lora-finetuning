In the heat of the island nights
In the sand of a moonlit beach
With the waves growing ever so near
Just out of reach
There you hold me so close in your arms
And the stars up above in the sky
Were reflecting and dancing so brightly there in your eyes
Imagine with me for a while if you dare
Any place we want to be
That's what I see when I look in your eyes
Suddenly everything's real
There when I look in your eyes
There I can see my world inside your eyes
I see the light
Your eyes, they shine so bright
Your eyes, I see the love
Your eyes, it shines so bright
In the cold of a winter's night
In a cabin out by the lake
As we look upon snow-laden trees
Dawn starts to break
As we lay there beside the fire
With a passion that burns inside
Flames of our love reflecting there in your eyes
You can see brightness where darkness exists
You're everything I need to be
That's what I see when I look in your eyes
Suddenly everything's real
There when I look in your eyes
There I can see my world inside your eyes
I see the light
Your eyes, they shine so bright
Your eyes, I see the love
Your eyes, it shines so bright
In your eyes, I see the light
In your eyes, it shines so bright
Touched by grace your love's a gift I carry in my heart
A chance for heaven on earth this perfect love
Somehow I knew we'd always find each other here in time
Soulmates joined for life from up above
Your eyes, I see the light
Your eyes, they shine so bright
Your eyes, I see the love
Your eyes, it shines so bright
In your eyes, I see the light
In your eyes, it shines so bright
In your eyes, in your eyes
