Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fall apart, too connected
Make it not appear for the next trick
I've been thrown, I've been hectic
Made my way back home, so domestic
I, I won't fight it
Anymore, anymore
I have tried not to ignite it
Now I won't light it
And I know we will be sick this time
I will wait right here'til the next trip
You're on fire, you're electric
Taking measurements in the metric aisle
I won't fight it anymore
Anymore
I have tried
Not to ignite it now
I won't let it down
And I know we will be safe this time
Barter the rest we owe
We have a right now to discover
The place we go and where we have been
Give me the heart and soul
I am enamored by the things you've given
Now and whenever
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
I, I won't fight it anymore, anymore
I have tried
To reignite it
Now I won't fight it
And I know we will be safe this time
