The bird and the goat have a lot
I am told, be a man, be your tour
Let's be tired,'til it works
Said every little caption takes the eyes
And leaves them counting out for more
Cradle to the bottom to a well
To have their chances anymore
The game and the cost
Have allied to a loss
The undead
To the fire'til it hurts
And every brittle passion takes a smile
And lets it shine into the core
Evil is the taxing of our eyes
That leave us stranded wanting more
All this as predicted for the bird (you're missing)
The bird (you're missing)
The bird (you're missing)
The bird (you're missing)
The bird and the ghost have a lot I am told
Be a man, be your tone
Let's be tired
'Til it works
Said every little caption takes the eyes
And leaves them camping out for more
Cradle to the bottom to a well
To hide their chances anymore
