The weight of this separation crushes us
Into something stronger
Still a thousand times a night I think of driving highways
To your ranch in Colorado
But I've become all real this time
And can't expect life to play that way
I promised the distance wouldn't kill the romance
Until the proof just say, yeah, yeah, this love won't stay
Oh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, it's too old time
This love won't stay, yeah, yeah, yeah, it won't fade
I've heard it said that love can change the most callous of all men
A word of mouth is just some thin layer from above
Until you experience it for yourself
But I've become a realist now
And can't expect life to play that way
I'd probably study since wouldn't kill the romance
I'd see a male proof just to say, yeah, yeah
This love won't stay
Oh, faith (oh, faith, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You still want time (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
This love won't stay (oh, faith, faith, faith)
Oh, faith
Away
And I feel like a million dollars when I'm with you
And I feel like a billion dollars when I'm with you
And I feel like I'm gonna fall to pieces
A trillion tiny pieces every time I'm away
'Cause I'm away from you, away from you
This love won't step away
'Cause love won't stay if both fade away
Away from you, away from you
Where from, yeah
Where from, yeah, yeah, yeah
