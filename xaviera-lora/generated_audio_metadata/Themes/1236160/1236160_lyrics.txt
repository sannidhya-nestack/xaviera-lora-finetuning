Every day you wonder why the world was so sad
You were growing older and then walked away
Now you're reading between the lines of an empty tale
But your cradle is not the same
Drive away, your fears will pull you under
Come to stay, wipe your tears away
All the reasons we said simply fade away
But desire remains the same
Drive away, your fears will pull you under
Come to stay, wipe your tears away
Drive away, we need another future
Come to stay
And please et the past
Take the opportunity
You could write a new tale with me
Be my time, don't deny it
Fly away
Your fears will pull you under
Come to stay and wipe your tears away
Drive away, we need another future
Come to stay and please et the past
