Even now I lie beneath the moon
Feeling like a leaf that fell too soon
From your highest bow I guess we're even now
Though I'm told someone will take your place
I know there will always be a trace
Of our broken vow, I guess we're even now
You betrayed my trust and made the tears roll down my cheek
Listen while I cry myself to sleep
Funny how the one you thought would stay
Suddenly's the one who got away
You'll get by somehow, I guess we're even now
Bittersweet are the memories I cannot erase
Bittersweet the music I must face
Oh, Charmaine
Even now the waves roll on the shore
Even now, you're standing at my door
Look who's come around
I guess we're even now
Let's leave this battleground
I guess we're even now
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
