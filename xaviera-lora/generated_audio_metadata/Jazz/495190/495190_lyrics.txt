No regrets, this is just the way it turned out to be
No regrets, as you said, love's tide can change like the sea
We had our day
We sang our song, we took a chance
Oh well, it's gone, no regrets
Though it seems so hard to tell you goodbye
Don't et
Every ending has its own reasons why
Who could know letting go is such a heavy price to pay
No regrets, turn the light off, walk away
No regrets, this is just the way it turned out to be
No regrets, as you said
Love's tide can change like the sea
We had our day
We sang our song
We took a chance
Oh well, it's gone
No regrets
Though it seems so hard to tell you goodbye
Don't et every ending has its own reasons why
Who could know letting go is such a heavy burden?
No regrets, turn the light off, walk away
