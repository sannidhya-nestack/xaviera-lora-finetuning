You call me honey, you give me money
I know you'd give me even more if you could
Your smile is sunny, and you are funny
When I fall deeper in the dumps than I should
I'm lucky, nobody knows
You buy my clothes, but I got woes
You're plucky
But we have a problem
And love you don't know how to be good
I see a taboo
Not even voodoo
Could ever change you so that you understood
So keep your money
I'm not your honey
I want a different kind of man
A man who's bad, a lowdown cat
I need the wolf from Little Red Riding Hood
My what big teeth you have
I'm lucky, nobody knows
You buy my clothes, but I got woes
You're plucky, but we have a problem
At love you don't know how to be good
I see a taboo, not even voodoo
Could ever change you so that you understood
So keep your money, I'm not your honey
I want a different kind of man, a man who's bad, a low down cat
I need the wolf from Little Red Riding Hood
Keep your money, don't call me honey
I want a different kind of man, a man who's bad, a low down cat
I need the wolf from Little Red Riding Hood
