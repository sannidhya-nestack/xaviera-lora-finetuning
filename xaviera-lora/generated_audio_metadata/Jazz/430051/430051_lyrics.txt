A Penelope of nights
To quietly hold you tight
Is the zenith of this life
The pinnacle of joy
Princess always lying on a pea
Praying for a better destiny
Why did the genie fly by
And rise darkly into the night sky
In the hazy afternoon
With nothing much to do
Truth weighed down on her
The palm trees heavy
The air tinted with myrrh
Nothing could erase the vision of that face
Though she did not know it, she could feel it, breathe it
Where could she find that vision, make it real
Make it begin for a thousand and one nights, nights
Slowly the dream, not a hunger
Into her soft features
Then nothing could rouse her
Deep was her sleep
The pea grew larger
Her sadness swelled deeper
Where was the face she yearned to deeply embrace?
Nothing could erase the vision of that face
Though she did not know it
She could feel it, breathe it
Where could she find that vision?
Make it real
Make it begin
For a thousand and one nights
A thousand and one, a thousand and one, a thousand and one nights
