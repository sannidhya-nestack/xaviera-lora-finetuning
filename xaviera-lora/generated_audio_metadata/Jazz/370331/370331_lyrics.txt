July in the sunshine
Oh what a beautiful day
If you got nothing to do
I'd like to spend it with you
Just passing time away
July in the sunshine
This feels like a dream come true
Sun and the sea and you're here with me
July, the sunshine and you
Weather's so fine
Let's drink some wine
Relax a little while
If you're in the mood
For some exotic food
We can eat al fresco style
July in the sunshine
There's nothing I would rather do
Take a walk in the sand holding your hand
You light the sunshine and you
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
The weather's so fine, let's drink wine
Relax a little while
If you're in the mood for some exotic food
Let's eat al fresco style
July in the sunshine
Nothing I would rather do
Than take a walk in the sand
Holding your hand
July the sunshine
And you come
July
The sunshine
And you, you, you, you, you
Oh July
The sunshine
And you
