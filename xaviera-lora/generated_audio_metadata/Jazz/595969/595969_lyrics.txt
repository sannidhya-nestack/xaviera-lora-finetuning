When you say hello, darling I'm not slow
Finding words that will not compromise you
You say, "For a start, listen to your heart and talk to me"
These words come easily
Lovely, lovely, lovely, love be bold
Love me, love me, love me, love unfold
Lovely, lovely, lovely, and it's clear
Love me, love me, love me, now you're here
Now you have the words, flying out like birds
Finding now how beautiful they can be
Together we can climb
Making words that rhyme tell all the world
These words come easily
Lovely lovely lovely please be true
Love you love you love you I love you
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely face
I can see no word is out of place
Lovely, lovely, lovely, please be true
Love you, love you, love you, I love you
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely face
I can see no word is out of place
I can see no word is out of place
