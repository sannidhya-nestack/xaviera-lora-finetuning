A dead-end street, that's what I'm on
Wearing a rut in the ground
It's clear I'm going nowhere fast
And need to turn myself around
It's not the first time
It won't be the last I've had to start over again
I'm sure I'll regain my direction
Just not so sure of how or when
Sleepless past midnight
Still up at dawn
Swear by the first light
Today's the day I'm moving on, easy to say
But I can't seem to find my way
No point remaining
She's gone for good
No use in hanging around the same old neighborhood
Don't mean to stay but I can't seem to find my way
Like a leaf blown by the north wind
More adrift than I imagined
I've never been quite so lost
Before I lost her
Friends say
To get out, meet someone new
Take the first step out
And walk on down the avenue maybe someday
But I can't seem to find my way
