Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.
If you say that you love me
Make sure you mean it
I don't play those foolish games anymore
I've been around for way too long
And heard it all before
Every lie, every promise ever made
So if you really love me
If you really want me
And if you're really certain I'm the one
I'll give my heart to you
So many times I've trusted
So many times I've paid the price
Swept away on a sea of change
But your kiss
Is beguiling
And your eyes enticing
I'm falling deeper
Under your spell
So if you
And if you really want me
And if you really need me
I'll be there for you
So if you really, really love me
If you really, really want me
And if you really, really need me
I'll be there
For you
