I'm alone in the darkness
I'm alone on the street
In this city of strangers
That I never will meet
These first days of November
Bring that ominous chill
That cold isolation
That strangles the will
That conjures the feeling of cold and alone
Tender heart in this city of stone
It seems my only friend here is that cold silver balloon
Oh tonight it's just me and the moon
Once there was light in this dreary place
The sun shone bright
On her beautiful face
Those eyes, those lips
Those days were eclipsed
Much too soon
I'm alone in the darkness
I'm adrift on the sea
I'm consumed with the hunger
For some warm company
I'm not sure where she is now
Probably far, far away
On some tropical island
Where the tall palm trees sway
And the scent of her perfume
Is locked in my brain
The sweetest mixture of pleasure and pain
Once we danced closely to some sweet lover's tune
But tonight it's just me and the moon
Oh tonight it's just me, me and the moon
