Love can lift us when we fall, then drop us to our knees
I don't know if love conquers all, but Lord it sure beats me
You just know when it's love, when it's true, you can't deny it
There ain't no ifs, ands or buts when love hits you
Between the eyes it never leaves
When you wish it would if it ain't ready to
And it don't stick around if it has something else to do
Oh how can you tell you're in love's throes?
I don't know, you just know
Ooh, you just know (I do) he's the one (it's true)
When you're walking in dreamland (I don't want this dream to end)
You're awake (no doubt)'cause there's the sun (it's out)
And storm clouds look serene and you can't eat
Boy, you haven't since Tuesday afternoon (done it too)
You're floating toward the ceiling like a helium balloon (I'm flying)
How can you tell your love will grow?
I don't know, you just know
Oh how can you tell your love will grow
I don't know
You, you better look both ways baby
Just, just be careful child
No, no, no, no
You just know
