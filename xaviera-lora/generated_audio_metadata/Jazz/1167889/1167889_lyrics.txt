There were no tell-tale signs
A well farewell
No hints, not a glint at all
Our lives simply strolled along
But it was taking its toll
I was so much more than your pretty valentine
But we were never completely attached
And I'm resigned to say baby
We were just a terrible match
There will be why's
Like why would I hold you again?
And there will be times
When I wonder where you've been
But in the end what will mend
That which is broken is if I know
You once loved me
Darling, that's what you called me
Whenever the stars appeared
Now those words turn me over on this lonesome night
And your name's no longer spoken here
The breath in your voice, the gasp when we kissed
Still lingers in the air, I take in
And on the bed stand, those cocktail napkin love letters you wrote
Were just wine soaked paper words and meaningless
There will be days
When I won't think of you again it will be okay
If I never know where you've been
But in the end what will mend
That which is broken is if I know you once loved me
Deep inside I've died a thousand times
While I held my breath waiting for you
My heart keeps on beating that bears repeating
Yes it pounds in my chest like it's supposed to
Still for you
And I'm satisfied
To never see you again there will be times
When I will wonder just where you've been
But in the end what will mend
That which is broken is if I know
You once loved me
In the end, what will mend this heart that is broken?
As if I know, as if I know you just once loved me
