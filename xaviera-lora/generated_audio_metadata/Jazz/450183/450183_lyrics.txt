I know I screwed up, made awful mistakes
What I did was so wrong, it gives me the shakes
Should've known better, should've act more my age
Why don't you scold me and show me some rage
You're making me guilty by not getting mad
The thing that I done was really quite bad
Way too much love and not enough pain
I give no resistance but I am to blame
The way you treat me feels so much like thanking
Too much iveness and not enough spanking
I committed a sin, it was unjustified
Confessed it to you, told no lies
You let me off easy, a slap on the hand
Now guilt set in, I can't understand
Way too much love and not enough pain
I give no resistance but I am to blame
The way you treat me feels so much like thanking
Too much iveness and not enough spanking
X my lobotomy the bad comes good
X my lobotomy the bad comes good
Way too much love and not enough pain
I give no assistance but I am to blame
The way you treat me feels so much like thanking
Too much iveness and not enough spanking
Baby not enough banking
