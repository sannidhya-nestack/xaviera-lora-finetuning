I was born in the suburbs of the city of ours
Just north of the railway line
Raised in a house where daddy was king
Mama was always crying
Reached sixteen when I met the man
Said it'd take me away from here
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
Took me to places where the night people go
Fun to have a little drink
I saw lots of sad faces, lots of bad cases
But I never ever stopped to think
When he asked me to go back to his place
I went with eyes open wide
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
It's been a few months now
Since the baby's been born
It was born in the suburbs of the city of ours
Just north of the railway line
Raised in a house where daddy was king
Mama was always crying
He comes home late every night
Someday I swear I'll take his life
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
He called me his angel
But he's gonna make a devil out of me
