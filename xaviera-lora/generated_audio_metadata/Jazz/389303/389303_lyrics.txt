She done left town and she won't be coming back
She done left town and she won't be coming back
Took her TV and cigarettes and my brand new Cadillac
She done left town she just up and gone
She done left town
She just up and gone
Took everything she needed
And everything I owned
She done left town
all the money been spent
She done left town
All the money been spent
Didn't leave me no wine or whiskey
No cash for the rent
She done left town, oh she won't be coming back
She done left town, oh she won't be coming back
Took the TV and cigarettes, my brand new Cadillac
Oh she left town, man but that's okay
Oh, she done let down, yeah, but that's okay
Oh, I found me a new girl, said I could move in right away
