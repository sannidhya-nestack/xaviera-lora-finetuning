Luck ain't got nothing to do with it, no matter what they say
Luck ain't got nothing to do with it, I'll show you how to play
You watch the people sweating at the table
Look'em straight in the eyes
When you see a moment of doubt you pounce
It's the element of surprise
It's an easy game if you know how to play it
You play it slow
Keep your cards down low
And never let'em know that luck ain't got nothing to do with it
Luck ain't got nothing to do with it
The first time I saw you in the moonlight
My feet turned into clay
But I knew you wouldn't just fall in my lap
I had to make a play
So I took a chance and stepped in your moment
With butterflies in my head
Thinking maybe it was luck instead
But you just laughed and said luck ain't got nothing to do with it
Baby don't you know that luck ain't got nothing to do with it
When I took a chance and stepped in your moment
It was luck at first sight
Thinking that was my lucky night
But baby you were so right
Cause luck ain't got nothing to do with it
Luck ain't got nothing to do with it
Luck ain't got nothing to do with it
Luck ain't got nothing to do with it
