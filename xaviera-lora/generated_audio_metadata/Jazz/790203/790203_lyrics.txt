Where even now can we drop the whole thing
Where even now can we get along
When you broke my heart I knew
That hindsight's a better view
And I hope by now you realize it too
We're even now, don't even think about it
We're even now, no need to waste your time
When you saw me with somebody new
We were having a grand debut
Yeah, see the games you play can be played by two
Oh, but it's childish to be spiteful
Can't we be friends?
Let's fire up the old peace pipe
Here's where the bad blood ends
We're even now
We're even, Stephen
We're even now
And I believe in
It's good we're even now
We're even now, don't even think about it
We're even now, no sense carrying a grudge
When you slashed my tires I knew
What I thought were idle threats were true
And you'll act on them after you've had a few
We're even now, I'm done stalking your condo
We're even now and you won't catch me snooping around
Just wanted to check out your new place
Hung around a bit just in case
Until your new boyfriend told me to give you some space
But it's childish to be spiteful
Can't we be friends?
Let's smoke up the old peace pipe
Here's where the bad blood ends
We're even now, biscuits and gravy
We're even now, kiss me baby
It's good we're even now
And get over it we're even now
We're back together and even now
