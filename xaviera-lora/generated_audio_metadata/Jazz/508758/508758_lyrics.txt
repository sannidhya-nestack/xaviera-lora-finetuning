I've heard that new songs grow on trees and trees grow in the park
The park is by the water side where the children go to lark
Their lark is in the tree tops that sway beneath the stars
The stars are in your eyes dear I know them all by heart
Your heart and mine are tethered like balloons upon a string
And strings were meant for music
That's why my heart can sing
My song is filled with colour
Like a rainbow in the mist
And missed you've been since you've been gone
Too long since I've been kissed
And kissed were all the moments we walked beneath the moon
The moon conducts the ocean as I conduct this tune
And tunes were made for lovers who walk along the lane
I walk the lane at evening light until we meet again
Again I stop to write a song as words and memories blend
It's written in my heart, my love, each word I want to send
And tunes were made for lovers who walk along the lane
I walk the lane at evening light until we meet again
Again I stop to write a song with words and memories planned
It's written in my heart, my love, each word I want to send
