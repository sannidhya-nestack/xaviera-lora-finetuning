Do you believe that every rain should have a rainbow
As apology for the clouds up above
Do you believe in fairy tales
Do you believe in love
Do you believe the eyes are like a window
That share the secrets that burn in your soul
Do you believe that dreams come true
Do you believe in love?
Now I'm not talking about the kind of love you used to have
With others before we met
All filled with heartache and woe
But more like the magic of sunrise eternally waking your smile
that's how this love of mine grows
Do you believe a kiss is a kiss is a kiss is just a kiss
Or a gift with a magic spell?
Do you believe that dreams come true?
Do you believe in love?
Now I'm not talking about the kind of love you used to have with others before we met
All filled with heartache and woe
But more like the magic of sunrise eternally waking your smile
that's how this love of mine grows
And do you believe a kiss is a kiss is a kiss is just a kiss or a gift with a magic spell?
Do you believe a shiny night dreams of you too?
Oh would you? Oh could you?
Oh, do you believe in love?
