You don't shake it like you used to do
You don't make it like I want you to
You just fake it, baby that ain't no good
You just don't shake it anymore
Don't move me when we hit the sack
You don't groove me, you just turn your back
You won't suit me like you used to do
You just don't shake it anymore, yeah
You're sloppin' around in your dressin' gown
Your chin is hangin' on the floor
It seems the fire of your desire
Just ain't burnin' anymore
You don't shake it like you used to do
You don't make it
Like I want you to, you just fake it
And baby, you know that ain't no good
You just don't shake it anymore, no!
Do-da-do-da-do-da-do-da, do-da-do-da-do-da
Do-ba-do-ba-do-ba-do-ba, do-da
Da-da-da, da-da-ba-ba-ba, do-ah
You're sloppin' around in that dressin' gown
Your chin is hangin' on the floor
Seems the fire of your desire, well, just ain't burnin' anymore
You don't move me when we hit the sack
You don't groove me, you just turn your back
Won't shoot me, baby, like you used to do
You just don't shake it anymore, no!
Do-do-do-do-do-da
Do-ba-do-ba-do-ba-da
Do-da
Do-ba-do-ba-do-da
Do-ba-do-ba-do-do-da
Do, do, ah
Da, da, do, do, do, do, ah
Do, ah
Da, da, do, do, do, do, ah
Sloppin' around in that dressin' gown, baby
Chin is hangin' on the floor
Seems the fire of your desire, well
Just ain't burning anymore, no, you don't shake it
Like you used to do, you don't make it
Like I want you to, you just fake it, oh
And that ain't no good, oh
You just don't shake it anymore, no, no, baby, no
You just don't shake it anymore, you just don't do it no more, oh
You just don't shake it anymore
