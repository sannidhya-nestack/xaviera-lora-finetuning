Let me be close to you
Share your dreams with me
Tell me your fears
What brings tears to your eyes
Let me be close to you
Please don't turn away
In the lonely night
If you want me to, I'll stay
Take my hand
We'll find our way
Hand in hand
Love won't ever fade
Together we'll be closer
Together
Let me be close to you
Let me keep you company
All I want is for you to be here with me
Let me be close to you
Close to you
Let me live in your heart
Wherever you go
You won't be alone
You'll have two hearts
Beating as one
Take my hand, we'll find our way
Hand in hand, love won't ever fade
Together we'll be closer together
Take my hand
We'll find our way
Hand in hand
Love won't ever fade
Together we'll be closer
Together we'll be closer
Closer together we'll be closer
Together
