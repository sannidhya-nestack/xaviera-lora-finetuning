The skyline seems to disappear when you're lonely
Sidewalks don't lead anywhere when you're lonely in New York
Rush hour traffic, not a soul around
The echo of your heartbeat makes the only sound
Broadway is a dead end street when you're lonely in New York
Rockefeller Center doesn't rock when you're lonely in New York
A Central Park, just a parking lot
When you're lonely in New York
The lady with the torch is your one and only friend
In the city that never sleeps
Your nightmare never ends
You'd trade Manhattan for a string of beads
When you're lonely in New York
Sidewalks don't lead anywhere when you're lonely in New York
Broadway is a dead end street when you're lonely in New York
