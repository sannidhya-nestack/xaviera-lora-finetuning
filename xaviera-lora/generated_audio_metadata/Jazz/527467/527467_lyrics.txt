I said I'd love to go for a little rendezvous
Thinking of the sweet hellos
If I'd only known that I'd be all alone
In Rio de Janeiro
There's so many times that he's made me sad
But I'm making up my mind that I won't let it last
it's not all that bad in Rio de Janeiro
City lights are flashing in a syncopated fashion
Soon you'll see me laughing
And in the streets the people all are dancing
To the samba in Rio de Janeiro
You can't ever trust a man who promises the moon
The beach and all its sand
And what's a girl to do to keep from being blue
In Rio de Janeiro
Ah, Rio de Janeiro
Who'da ever known I'd be all alone in Rio
He knew to meet in Rio
What a way to fight
He's no longer mine at all
Ooh, not at all
Tanto céu e mar
Natureza e paz
Mesmo na distancia
Posso imaginar
Em você me andar assim
Como eu te geneiro
Um redentor
Que cuida de nós
Carnaval é samba
É um velho tom
Nadia comandia de sal no Rio de Janeiro
From a small café seat
Sundown bodies sway in warm and salty spray
While you hear the children play they need
A little care in Rio de Janeiro
So I'll let my broken heart disappear into the night
Dancing the stars away
And I might just stay right here in Rio de Janeiro
You can't ever trust a man who promises the moon
The beach and all its sand
And what's a girl to do to keep from being blue
In Rio de Janeiro
Rio de Janeiro
In Rio de Janeiro
Rio de Janeiro, in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro
