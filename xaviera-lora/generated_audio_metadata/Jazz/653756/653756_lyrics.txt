What good is safety in all your money
You could be living like a king
Your best investment is your honey
Cause love doesn't cost a thing
Nobody hires the stars to twinkle
Nobody pays the birds to sing
They warble so we will all know
Love doesn't cost a thing
Right from the start invest in your heart
You'll find your fortune there
Consider the price and take my advice
You'll be a millionaire
Why would you fuss and fret with finance?
Misery's all that it can bring
You're rich in romance
Paid in advance
Love doesn't cost a thing
She'll have you dancing on a moonbeam
Turning your winter into spring
Bank on your dreams, not foolish schemes
Love doesn't cost, no interest is lost
Love doesn't cost a thing
