The silence of the reason in all its simple fashion
Is the freedom of expression in all its simple notions
As it's making due to wishing and falls into fruition
As it's calling back to what you feel for
Hear the vision of the season in all its playful teasing
As it lingers in motion, swirling round the ocean
As it feeds itself forever and grabs a new perceiver
As it comes back, baby, what's it safe for now?
We're gonna take it uptown
Then we'll move it all around
And put it back to where, yeah
You know it's gonna be a smooth time
You know it's just a good time
Yeah, we're gonna have a good time, baby
It's gonna be a good time now
We're gonna have a smooth time, sugar
You know it's just a good time now
The wherewithal of ruling is the folly of the peaceful
That's keeping out the ruling, and staking out the motion
Of the coming through, the trapping of the hearts that keep on clapping
To see whatever they're for
In the vastness of a little, the hardness is brittle
As everyone can take of it, see the little movement
As it's coming through the portal, see the killer of mortal thoughts
That seem to linger, but are gone
You see we've known it all along
It's only just a song
That puts us back to where
Yeah, you know we're gonna have a good time
It's gonna be a good time
Yeah, we're gonna have a smooth time baby
We're gonna have a good time now
We're gonna have a smooth time sugar
Gonna have a good time now
Silence of the reason in all its simple fashion
Is the freedom of expression in all its simple notion
As it's making to the wishing and falls into fruition
As it's calling back to what you feel for
Hear the vision of the season in all its playful teasing
As it lingers in motion, swirling round the ocean
As it frees itself forever and grabs a new perceiver
And it comes back, baby, what's it safe for now?
We gon' take it uptown
Then we'll move it all around
And put it back where, yeah
You know it's gonna be a smooth time
You know it's just a good time
Yeah we're gonna have a smooth time baby
We're gonna have a good time now
It's gonna be a smooth time sugar
It's gonna be a good time now
