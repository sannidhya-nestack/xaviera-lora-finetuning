Let's not pretend, we both know it's over
We won't et those moments we've shared
But let's move on, we'll still keep our memories
Let's go our separate ways
And just call it a day
It's time to say goodbye
No need to shed a tear
You'll find someone new I know
Who'll be the right one for you
But we're just not the same
And neither one's to blame
You'll still be my friend
But let's not pretend
It's time to say goodbye
No need to shed a tear
You'll find someone new, I know
Who'll be the right one for you
But we're just not the same
And neither one's to blame
You'll still be my friend
But let's not pretend
