Apathetic is what I've come to be
This nine-to-five life is closing in on me
Let's fly away
Leave the dishes with my attaché
I know this little holiday inn in the Andes
Where no one ever goes
Way up high where the llama lives
And the coca grows
Holidaying in the Andes
Far off in Peru
Would a midnight swim
In Lake Titicaca appeal to you
We'll hire an anchor to give us a tour of the ruins
When day is done we'll be sipping rum getting blotto
In our bungalow at the Holiday Inn in the Andes
That's where we belong
Climbing the mountains and tubing the Amazon
You'll hire an anchor to show us around my ju-pi-chu
When the day is done we'll be sipping rum getting ruined
In the llama lounge of the Holiday Inn in the Andes
Far off in Peru would a midnight swim
In Lake Titicaca appeal to you
Far away in Peru just me and you
