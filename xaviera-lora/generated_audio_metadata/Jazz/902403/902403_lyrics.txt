I admit, I'm smitten
I'm still crazy'bout you
I've loved you all my life
But it's not enough time
I'm only getting started
There's still so much to do
Your life
No other most beautiful sight my eyes have seen
I know it sounds untrue but I'm still falling for you
This time we have together is another treasure to me
Let's just stay in this moment
So I can say for you
All the memories we created
Weren't lost, just slightly faded
But hearts like ours have memories too
And oh how I remember you
hearts like ours have memories too
