Mama, mama, mama, why do you treat me so?
Oh, mama, mama, mama, why do you treat me so?
I know why you treat me so bad
You treat me mean, baby, just because I'm gully low
Now, mama, mama, mama, why do you treat me so?
Oh, mama, mama, mama, why do you treat me so?
I know why you treat me so bad
You treat me mean, baby, just because I'm gully low
Now mama if you listen baby I'll tell you something you don't know, you don't know
If you just listen to me honey I'll tell you something you don't know
If you just give me a break and take me back I won't be gully no more, gully no more
Now, mama, if you listen, baby, I'll tell you something you don't know, you don't know
If you just listen to me, honey, I'll tell you something you don't know
If you just give me a break and take me back, I won't be gully no more, gully no more
