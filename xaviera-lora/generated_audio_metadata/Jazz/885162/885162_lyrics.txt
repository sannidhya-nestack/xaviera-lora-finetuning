It's snowed down but I'm warm under
It's blue there but I'm flying in wonder
The day is shimmering with pretty poems
The night is twinkling with love songs
I'm floating in your love, no fear of falling
I'm floating in your love, no fear of failing
It's falling over, but I stand taller than ever
It's darkened over but I'm filled with hope as never
Today is rippling with colored kites
The night is gleaming with bright sights
I'm floating in your love
No fear of falling
I'm floating in your love
No fear of failing
Floating in your love
Floating in your love
Floating, floating in your love
Floating
