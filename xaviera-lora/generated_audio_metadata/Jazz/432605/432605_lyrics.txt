Until it happens to you
You'll be walking in sunshine
And talking with a smile on your face
And laughing at romance
Unless you fall in love and lose
The best thing you've ever had
You won't know the meaning of the blues until it happens to you
My friends all ask what's come over me
What happened to the happy man I used to be
I shrug my shoulders and say I'll be alright
Then turn around to face another lonely night until it happens to you
At night you'll sleep easy
You won't lie awake and think of the one that took away the sun
You'll live your life and dream of love
With someone who won't hurt you
You'll be one of the lucky few
Until it happens to you
Unless you fall in love and lose
The best thing you've ever had
You won't know the meaning of the blues
Until it happens to you
My friends all ask what's come over me
What happened to the happy man I used to be
I shrug my shoulders and say I'll be alright
Then turn around to face another lonely night
Until it happens to you
At night you'll sleep easy
You won't lie awake and think of the one
That took away the sun
You'll live your life and dream of love
With someone who won't hurt you
You'll be one of the lucky few
Until it happens to you
You won't know the meaning of the blues
Until it happens to you
