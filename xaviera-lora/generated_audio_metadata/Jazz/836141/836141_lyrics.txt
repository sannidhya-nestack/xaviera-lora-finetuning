How bad do I want to feel better? Should I have a drink?
With my girlfriend's brother's friend, he's getting out of jail tonight
He says he likes me, that's alright I think
I'll wait another day
I'll wake up in the morning
Then I'll ask myself again
I'll say how bad do I wanna feel better
Go out and dance
Find a rowdy roadhouse club
And listen to some hot acts
Sing flat about love and romance
On second thought I'll pass
I'll spend the weekend reading and on Monday once again I'll ask
How bad do I wanna feel better?
Not that bad (not that bad)
I guess not bad enough, not that bad (not that bad)
I believe I'd better off not nothing
In fact I'm doing pretty well
All my love getting down with my own blue self
How bad do I wanna feel better?
How bad do I wanna feel better?
How bad do I wanna feel better?
How bad do I want to feel better
Should I call that dog who done me wrong
And tell him I ive him and it's him that I belong to after all
Oh he's probably hurting worse
I'd sooner scuba to Bermuda through a school of barracudas first
How bad do I want to feel better
Not that bad
I guess not bad enough, not that bad (not that bad)
I believe I'm better off, not that bad (not that bad)
Think I'm doing pretty well
All along getting down with my own blue self
How bad do I wanna feel better?
How bad do I wanna feel better?
How bad do I wanna feel better?
