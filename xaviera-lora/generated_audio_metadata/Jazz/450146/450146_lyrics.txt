Sleepy eyes, vision blurred, still in a dreamlike state
Inside this theater of absurd, between sleep and awake
I love the sleepy consciousness
I love my family
It's time to rise and face the day
Surprise is yet to see
Cup coffee, cup coffee, come to wake me up
More caffeine, more caffeine, you're my morning cup
My coffee cup, a special size, just right grip of hand
Wake me, shake me, you're my friend
I found just who I am
Cup coffee, cup coffee
Come to wake me up
More caffeine, more caffeine
You're my morning cup
Not too full and not too hot
Perfect temperature
Just the right amount of cream
You're my sleepy cure
More cup coffee, cup coffee, come to wake me up
More caffeine, more caffeine, you're my morning cup
Ooh, come to wake me up
