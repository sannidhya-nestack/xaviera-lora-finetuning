We all wanted more and more from you
We just thought of ourselves it was hard not to do
Greatness comes along we just can't let it pass
Eyes on the future, but our hearts in the past
Wish you were young again, back in your prime
Wish you were young again, just one more time
We saw you as you were fading away
A little slower as the dark turned to grey
When did it happen when you got old?
Never thinking
This day would unfold
Wish you were young again
Back in your prime
Wish you were young again
Just one more time
Can you do it one last go around
You did it so often we're so very proud
Giving us hope way back when
So what do you say, can you do it again
Wish you were young again, back in your prime
Wish you were young again, just one more time
Wish you were young again, back in your prime
Wish you were young again, just one more time
Wish you were young again
Back in your prime
Wish you were young again
Just one more time
