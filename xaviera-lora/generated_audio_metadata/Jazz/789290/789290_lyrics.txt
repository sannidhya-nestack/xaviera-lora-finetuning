He wears a zoot suit and a Stetson
A dually driving, driving cat
He'll give you a slip, take your bets then
Coolies right out the back
He's no rookie, and I'm so lucky
He's my boogie-woogie-boogie from Paducah, Kentucky
You can pick'em well into Sunday
that pigskin's in the air
Cruisin' for your winnings on Monday
Losin', boy, you better be there
Don't play hooky, or you'll get stuck
He's my boogie-woogie-boogie from Paducah, Kentucky
Boogie (boogie) boogie-woogie-boogie, he's my boogie
Boogie! Boogie-woogie-boogie, he's my boogie
Boogie! Boogie-woogie-boogie, he's my boogie
Boogie! Boogie-woogie-boogie, he's my guy
And I'm his little cookie from Patukake
Why I'm a boogie-woogie-boogie
The cops and the judges all love him
They treat him like a really big cheese
And all the laws he's above'em
But I can bring him down to his knees
Hey Pokey Pokey, it's your Pokey Wogey Pokey
What I gotta do to get a little bit of nookie?
Pokey (Pokey)
Pokey Wogey Pokey, he's my Pokey (Pokey)
Pokey Wogey Pokey, he's my Pokey (Pokey)
Pokey Wogey Pokey, he's my Pokey
Boogie, boogie, boogie, he's my boogie
He's my guy and I'm his little cookie
Papa Duke of KY, I'm a boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, woogie, boogie, he's my boogie
Boogie, woogie, boogie, he my boogie
Boogie, woogie, boogie, he's my boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie
He's my guy and I'm his little cookie from Paducah, KY
My boogie, woogie, boogie
He's my guy and I'm his little cookie from Paducah, KY
My boogie, woogie, boogie
B-O-O-K-I-E
He's my boogie
Boogie
