A certain thing has puzzled me greatly
Just lately my dear, my dear
Why does a fellow always get stupid
When Cupid is near, is near
Although I was the smartest at college
That knowledge I fear, hope to never bring
A Romeo, the only thing he wants to know
How many sighs have you sighed in my ear?
How many lies have you whispered my dear?
How many baby blue eyes have you gazed right into?
How many loving words have you spoken?
How many promises have you broken?
How many times have you left me alone?
Told me had business and yet you come home
I know where you were because I saw you
And I got home just a minute before you
Oh baby how many times
Out with his lady friend, walking and talking of love
A moon that has a silvery line in the shining above
The girl that says you certainly do like a crew like a dove
A nervous youth, a jealous miss
Who wants the truth, is asking this
How many times have you said I love you?
How many times have you said I'll be true?
How many wonderful sweeties have you told that to?
How many times has a certain feeling troubled you so that you hit the ceiling?
How many hands have you held all alone?
How many lips have you pressed to your own?
I'd hate to think that you've kissed too many
But I feel worse if you have kissed any
Please tell me how many times?
A certain thing has puzzled me greatly just lately, my dear
Why does a fellow always get stupid when Cupid is near?
Although I was the smartest at college that knowledge I feared
Could never bring a Romeo
The only thing he wants to know
