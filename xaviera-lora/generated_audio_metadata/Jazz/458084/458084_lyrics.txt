Chardonnay, like an autumn day
Like your smile when you look my way
Makes me warm like wine, like a fine Chardonnay
Our love like a sunripe vine
Round in full as our bodies entwine
Full of heat and light like a dry shirt and air
Liquid kiss, intoxicating on my waiting tongue
Earthy flavors fill my mouth, I savor every one
And when you are away
Then I will drink to the day
When again you are mine
With your kisses like wine
Like a fine chardonnay
Chardonnay
Chardonnay
