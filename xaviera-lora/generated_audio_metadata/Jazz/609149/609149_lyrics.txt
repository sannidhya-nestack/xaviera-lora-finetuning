Blue and set again
Over you again
And I'm not trying to be naive
I'm looking for something I can't believe
Just a shadow of someone I used to be
I've been had again
If you'd be so kind
Help me find my mind
'Cause in this world, well, the path of love
Is not as constant as stars above
It could be that I've had enough
I've been had again
In this wood I cling just like a vine
A little place I can take my troubles to
August moon don't make me over
Put me in clover with a neat Valentine
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I can take a chance on this wild romance
Old love soon calls on the chosen few
I need a love that is always true
And not a love that is there for others too
I've been had again
In this world I cling just like a vine
For a place I can take my troubles to
Old August moon, don't make me over
Put me in clover with a neat Valentine
Can't take this chance
On a wild romance
In this world, well, the path of love
Is not as constant as stars above
It could be that I've had enough
I've been Heb again
