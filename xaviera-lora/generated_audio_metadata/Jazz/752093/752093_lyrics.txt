Nobody does me the way you do me
Nobody does what you can do
You rub me the right way like ouf-ray ouf-slay
It's hard to believe I used to say
If you're not here, I'm not here
What I'm here after, you'll be here after I'm gone
But that's just hard talk, wherever you are
I will come running after you, oh
The way you chill
You're gonna kill me
But darling what a way to go
Oh yeah
You're up to your hijinks
You are my private sphinx
To what pleasure do I owe?
If you're not here after what I'm here after
You'll be here after I'm gone
But who am I kidding?
You do my bidding
I will come running after you
I will come running after you
