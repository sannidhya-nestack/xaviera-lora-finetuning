I see the moonlight dancing in your hair
It glistens and makes me stare
Oh baby, I want a moonlight love affair
There is no one for miles around
It's just you and me, the birds and the bees
And I don't mean that flying around
Oh baby, my baby, I want a moonlight love affair
Yeah (moonlight love affair)
The time is right, it's a beautiful night for a love affair
Let's dance the night away (dance the night away)
I know you feel the way that I do, what I'm saying is true
I'm promising you a night you will never et
Oh, tomorrow is another day
Girl, we might not feel the same way
Oh, baby, my baby, I want a moonlight love affair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Silence]
The time is right, it's a beautiful night for a love affair
Let's dance the night away (dance the night away)
I know you feel the way that I do, what I'm saying is true
I'm promising you a night you will never et
Tomorrow is another day
Girl, we might not, we might not, we might not feel the same way
Oh baby, my baby, I want a moonlight love affair
I want a moonlight love, I want a moonlight love of pain
