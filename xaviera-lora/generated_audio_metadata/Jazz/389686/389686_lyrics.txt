Helpless, helplessly falling
I don't know how to begin
Won't you believe me when I look in your eyes
That I'm helplessly falling
Follow you
Helpless, helpless searching
Deep in your eyes for a sign
Won't you come ask me and I'll tell you it's true
That I've helplessly followed you
Why do you keep my heart waiting
When will you see what I know
Why can't you hear my heart's calling
When will you let
Your heart believes that I'm helpless
Helplessly calling
Reaching for you in my dreams
Please let me love you forever tonight
Now I'm helplessly bothered in love
Ooh, ooh
Helpless, helplessly falling
Wondering what more to say
Please let me show you how I know you're the one
Cause I'm helplessly falling in love
Helplessly falling, helplessly falling
Helplessly falling in love
