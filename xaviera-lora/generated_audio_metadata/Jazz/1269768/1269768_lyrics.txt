Tonight I'm down hardy, for though we have parted
I love you and I always will
Meanwhile I'm so lonely, I'm rising only
To see if you care for me still
Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
If your heart's filled with pain shall I come back again?
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight?
I hold with affection upon recollection
A romance of days now gone by
And often I wonder if I made blunder
By letting you bid me goodbye
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me dead?
If your heart's filled with pain shall I come back again?
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight?
I hold with affection upon recollection
A romance of days now gone by
And often I wonder if I made a blunder
By letting you bid me goodbye
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
If your heart's filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?
