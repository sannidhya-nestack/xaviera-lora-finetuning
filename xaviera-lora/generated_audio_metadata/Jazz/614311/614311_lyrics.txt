Moan like autumn wind
High in the lonesome treetops and green lanterns
Calling to the heights of stars
Sob on the long cool winding saxophones
Drum on your drums
Bang altogether, drums, traps, banjos, horns and tin cans
Make two people fight at the top of the stairways
And scratch each other's eyes in a clinch
Tumbling down the stairs
