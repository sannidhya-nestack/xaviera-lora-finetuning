I know they say, someday I'll find my rhythm
When every beat aligns just right for me
But what about today, can someone show me how to groove while I'm waiting
Waiting for that spark to drive me free
I feel it in my bones, can't know just what I mean
We're both searching for code, who really knows what this life could be
But in the shadows, I hear that whisper
It's a tale of truth wrapped in mystery
Oh, the journey's our song, let's rise together
Finding light in all our history
They say the world spins while holding secrets tight
Yeah, beneath the surface we fight for peace
Can we break these chains?
Someone tell me what to do while I'm crafting
Crafting all my dreams to find release
I know you feel that pull, it's a chance to break free
We'll unroll the scrolls from every struggle, we'll find it key
But in the shadows, I hear them whisper
It's a tale of truth with hope, the journey's our song
Finding light in all our history
And with each note we play, we'll chase the night
Turning shadows into a dance we hold tight
As the music guides us, we won't lose sight
That through the heart we may rise to the height
But in the shadows, I hear the whisper
It's eternal truth, I hear the truth of the mystery
Oh, with the journeys all sung, let's rise together
Finding light in all our history
