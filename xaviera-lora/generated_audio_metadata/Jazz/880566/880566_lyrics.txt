Oh, my sweet Daisy, this place is crazy
No, I'm stationed with 101st down in New Orleans
Came down to Mississippi on the Creole Queen
Was the darnedest thing that I ever done seen
They got good times, women and whiskey falling out of trees
Goodbye Poughkeepsie, farewell Hoboken
My ties with you are forever broken, yeah
Sell my stuff, I ain't never coming home
Find a, find a place where I belong
Where there's good times, lemon and a whiskey falling out of trees
Oh, this might be the very last time you hear from me
I'm writing this letter on a napkin down at your only feet
Oh, the joy it is to be dancing up and down the streets
I found a little slice of paradise
Heaven on earth, there's no other
Oh, I'm a Yankee doodle dandy
But I'm in love with all of this Southern candy, yeah
And I'll be here'til the day I die
Why the hell would I say goodbye to good times
When banana whiskey fall right out of them trees, good times
Women and whiskey all good times
Women and whiskey yeah
Falling right out of them trees
