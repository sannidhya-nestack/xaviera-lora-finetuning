Have I told you when it's late at night
And I call out your name
And have I told you since the day you left
Nothing's ever been the same
You told me and I was a fool to believe you were the one
I feel so alive
Bring back those feelings tonight
And even though we never met
All these things go
Spinning round my head
Has it come to this?
I am the one
Who can't live
Without your love
Oh oh oh
Bring back these feelings'cause it's been too long
Bring back these feelings it's with you that I belong, oh yeah
