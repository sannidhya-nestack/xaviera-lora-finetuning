Ooh ah baby what do you want from me
Ooh ah baby what do you want from me
Ooh ah baby what do you want from me now
Feeling like a vagabond
The sun has crashed out on the lawn
The moon is waiting for the dawn
To make a miracle
I wish I was a stowaway
Sailing off to Biscayne Bay
Or maybe to Antarctica
To catch some snow on my tongue
Blow, vagabond wind
Blow like the whistle of an old steam train
It's a ride from the eye of a hurricane
Spring is just a rumor now
Fall is like a wedding bell
Summer's gone, somewhere to play
And winter's on the way
Blow, vagabond wind
Blow like the whistle of an old steam train
It's a ride from the eye of a hurricane
Destination don't know where
So any road will get me there
Bank me off the midnight sun
I'll catch some snow on my tongue
I'll catch some snow on my tongue
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me?
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me?
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me?
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me?
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me?
Ooh, ah, baby, what do you want from me now?
