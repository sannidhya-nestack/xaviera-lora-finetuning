Hummingbirds like two hearts on the wing
Up in the air, leaving to sing
Figure the reason can tell you why
Hearts are forever bound to the sky
All thought we give to life and love
We see the world from above
Hearts will be beating just like our wings
We never stop at wondering things
Inclement weather, shine or rain
And in our love we seek no fame
It is our plan to be a pair
Hummingbirds, we just love the air
hummingbirds, we are always a pair
Just like two birds, we're always aware
We feel the rhythm in our soul
To make a simple perfect whole
We feel the gentle warm caress
Of summer breezes on our breasts
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-ra, la-la-la-la-la
As hummingbirds we are always a pair
Just like two birds we're always aware
We feel the rhythm in our soul
To make a simple perfect home
We feel the gentle warm caress
Of summer breezes on our breaths
