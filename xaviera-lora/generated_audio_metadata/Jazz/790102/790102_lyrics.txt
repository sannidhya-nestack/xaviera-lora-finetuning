I know you find love so hard to commit to
Because of all the other loves who did you
So wrong so long ago now you're a little gun shy
Why dwell hell let's have a little fun
I think that you're the perfect one for me oh
Take those blinders off so you can see, so
It's clear, it's here and now, so if you're not too tainted
Drive by tonight and let's get reacquainted
If you could swing it, baby, swing on by
You know my number, ring it, let's give it one more try
You've heard this song before
But if you listen just once more
I'll be the very last one you hear singing
If you could swing it
And think it's not unwise
Maybe you could spring it on me
And I'll act surprised
I never meant to pressure you
But don't you know how much I treasure you
If you could swing it
Bring it home tonight
If you could swing it, baby swing on by
You know my number ring it, let's give it one more try
You've heard this song before, but if you listen just once more
I'll be the very last one you hear sing it
If you could swing it, and think it's not unwise
Maybe you could swing it on me and I'll act surprised
I never meant to pressure you
But don't you know how much I treasure you
If you could swing it, bring it home tonight
If you could swing it
If you could swing it
If you could swing it, bring it home tonight
