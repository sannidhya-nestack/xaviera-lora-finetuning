Mr. Big's downstairs, he wants a word with you
He wants answers, not dancers, he wants some results
Or you'll be looking at the bottom of his shoe
You got explaining to do, Mr. Big wants you
Mr. Big's downstairs, he's got an ugly tie
He's got a real evil look in his eye
He made the receptionist cry
I see a vulture or two, Mr. Big wants you
He's from the mean streets on the wrong side of the tracks
He's left a lot of claw marks in a lot of poor suckers' backs
He carries an axe, so just try to relax
Mr. Big wants you
Mr. Big's downstairs, he's in an ugly mood
He says the numbers are bad and the numbers don't lie
He wants some new attitude
I'm telling you dude, Mr. Big wants you
Oh there's a grease spot where your predecessor stood
He makes Scrooge look like Gandhi in Robin Hood
If you're sweating it, you probably should
Mr. Big wants you
Yeah, so Mr. Big wants you
Nice knowing ya
