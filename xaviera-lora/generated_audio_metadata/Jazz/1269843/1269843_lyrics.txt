Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
When I whispered love, sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true
Someday on the Ganges I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss, the silent shore
Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
When I whispered love, sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true
Someday on the Ganges, I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore
Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
When I whispered love, sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true
Someday on the Ganges, I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss, kiss the silo chore
