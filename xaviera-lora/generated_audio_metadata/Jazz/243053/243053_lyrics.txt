Right now we'd like to do So Long, Darkfowl
Pack up all my cares and woe
Here I go, moaning low
Bye-bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and so is she
Bye bye Blackburn
No one here can love or understand me
And her one hard luck story is
They all hand me
So make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight, blackbird
Said pack up all of my cows and woa
Hi mama, don't you know your daddy's got to go
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bye
Bye bye bye bye blackbird
Well somebody wait for me
Sugar is sweet and so is she
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye blackbird
But said no one here can love or understand me
And oh what hard luck stories they all wanna hand me
Hey I'mma make my bed and light the light
Your daddy's creepin' in kinda late tonight
Blackbird, blackbird, blackbird, blackbird, blackbird
(Humming)
No one here can love or understand big fat me
But old world hard love stories they all wanna, yeah
I said, "Now, mama, make my bed and light the lights
Your daddy's coming home kinda late tonight, like burn"
I said a blackbird
Blackbird, blackbird, blackbird, bird boy
Get down
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much
