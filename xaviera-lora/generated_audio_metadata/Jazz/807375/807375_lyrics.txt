Kiss me in the rain
Tell me how you miss my lips, my way
Will I have to pray
Every time you seem to go away
You don't have to say
I'm not your game to play
Will I have to wait
For the love that you've wasted
Kiss me in the rain
Tell me how you miss my lips, my way
Will I have to pray
Every time you seem to go away
You don't have to stay
I'm not your game to play
Will I have to wait
For the love that you've wasted?
I'm not your game to play
Will I have to wait
For the love that you've wasted
