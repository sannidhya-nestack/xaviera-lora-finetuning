Am I right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
If you come crawling in the middle of the night
Everything's gonna be alright
When the cats away
This my house we'll play
Oh that's right
Break out the bubbly
Celebrate my release
Raise the glass
It's gonna taste so sweet
When the cats away
This my house we'll play
Now the boss man's gone
This is the time to have some fun
Keep all the good times rolling on
On and on
I've been flying free as a bird
The latest news, have you heard?
When the cat's away, this mouse will play
I'm gonna play with you baby
Now the boss man's gone
This is the time to have some fun
Keep all the good times rolling on
On and on, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been flying free as a bird
The latest news you must have heard when the cats away
This mouse will play, yeah, oh yeah
When the cat's away, this mouse will play
That's right, when the cat's away, this mouse will play
