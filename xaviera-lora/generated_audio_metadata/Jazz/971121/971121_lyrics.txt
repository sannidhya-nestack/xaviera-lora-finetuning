We can fly to Paris, I'll take you anytime
And we can ride that bullet train, it'll all be on my dime
But when you stop that travel log of all my rotten deeds
I beg you please honey, let's not go there
We can visit Hong Kong
For seven days or more
And I'll escort you through those shops
You know I won't get bored
But when you crack that scrapbook now
On how I lost our dough
I'll just say, "Whoa, babe, let's not go there, no"
I try so hard to wipe away the missteps of my past
Like when I lost my wedding ring
Or put you in that cast, oh
We've had so many good time trips
So lovely sights we've seen
So when we're cruising down memory lane
Can you please steer away from me, please?
Up and away we'll go
To taking all those sights
And how about that safari trip
You dreamt of all those nights
But when you drop in that hall of shame
Of all my past mistakes
I say spare me
Oh be clear honey let it lie
Let's not go there
Let's not go there, no
