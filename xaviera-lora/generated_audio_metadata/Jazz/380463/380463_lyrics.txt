Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My heart beats a little quick
My feet have a little skip
I know it, ooh, I know it
When I wake up I think of you
And all the cute little things that you always do
I know it
Oh I just know it
Like I know the sun will rise
East in the morning
The stars I know shine brightly at night
My love for you can no longer be denied
I wanna walk hand in hand and head touch forever
It's heaven on earth when we are together
They say love is blind but I can clearly see, oh
When I wake up, I think of you
And all the cute little things that you always do
I know it, oh, I just know it
Like I know the sun will rise east in the morning
The stars, I know they shine brightly at night
My love for you can no longer be denied
I wanna walk hand in hand and head toward forever
It's heaven on earth when we are together
They say love is blind but I can clearly see
Oh, ba-da-da-ba, ba-ba
I wanna walk hand in hand
And head top forever, it's heaven on earth when we are together
They say love is blind, but I can clearly see
Oh, I just know it
