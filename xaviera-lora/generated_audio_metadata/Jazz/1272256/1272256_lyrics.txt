I'll picture myself, the material girl
Wouldn't life be fancy on some old couture?
Then the picture would fade like a photo in a magazine
I knew I'd get bored without a song in my heart
Even if it's hard sometimes to live by the day
Try not to worry and make ends meet and
Keep in mind that life is beautiful, beautiful
Can't wait for love and money
Money ain't quite enough for me
No lust for gold or silver, that ain't a thing
I wanna live my life my own way
A few words of love will carry me away
Make my heart melt like snow in the sun
Money money
Money isn't okay for me
No love or money for me
Even if it's hard sometimes
To get up in the morning and still believe in
Look for today and try not to worry
Life is beautiful, beautiful
Can't look for love on my knee
Money ain't quite enough for me
No lust for gold or silver, that ain't my thing
I won't live my life my own way
Even if it's hard sometimes
To look for the day and try not to worry and
Still believe and still believe that life is
Beautiful, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
That's what life is, mm-mm-mm
Beautiful
I like it
But I don't love it
Ain't gonna live for the love of money
I like it
But I don't love it, ain't gonna look for love in it
I like it
But I don't love it, ain't gonna live for the love of money
Even if it's hard (I like it) sometimes
But I don't love it, ain't gonna live for the love of money
I won't be a slave for the money
But I don't love it, ain't gonna live for the love of money
But I don't love it, ain't gonna love it for a love of many
I like it, but I don't love it, ain't gonna love for a love of many
