When you walk into the room, my head begins to spin
Don't know where I'm going, or where on earth I've been
I'm on the edge of falling for love I never knew
I'm so close to getting close to you
When my love song starts to play, do you hear its theme?
Are we just a kiss away, or is this just a dream?
Good things come to those who wait, how I hope it's true
I'm so close to get close to you
Are we just a kiss away, or is it just a dream?
Good things come to those who wait, how I hope it's true
I'm so close to getting close, so close to getting close
So close to getting close to you
So close to getting close to you
