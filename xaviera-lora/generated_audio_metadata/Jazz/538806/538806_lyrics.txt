Last night I sat alone, sunk in misery
Last night my loneliness left me in agony
Last night my world was dark, but if I only knew
My world would change to light tonight when I met you
Tonight I see things clearly
I wished upon a star
And just like out of a movie, baby, suddenly
There you are, oh, all of this time I thought
That dreams do not come true
Call me a believer'cause tonight I have met you
Let's go!
Tonight I see things clearly
I wished upon a star
And just like out of a movie
Baby, suddenly there you are
All of this time I thought
That dreams do not come true
Call me a believer
tonight I have met you
Call me a believer'cause tonight I have met you
Call me a believer'cause tonight I have met you
