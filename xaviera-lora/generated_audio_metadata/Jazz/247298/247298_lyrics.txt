When did all the music slow and all the lights turn way down low?
Where's the catheters in the low? Where did Harlem go?
All the fancy motor cars pulling up to high class bars
It faded out like morning stars, where did Harlem go?
Flatfoot knocked out topstead dame hanging off their eyes with flames
Praying for billions filled with millions dancing'til they're done
No more to those bright lights shining derailed is the A train line
They've traded all their gas for swine where did Harlem go?
Ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ba-da-da-da-da-dada
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
I've seen the faded snapshots of swinging Harlem hotspots
Black ties, hot glass dances, frozen, mid-step on the floor
Where did all the music flow and all the lights turn way down low?
I miss the Cadiz in the know, where did Harlem go?
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-ba-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
