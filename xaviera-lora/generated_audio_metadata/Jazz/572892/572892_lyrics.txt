Just around the corner
Something's waiting for me
I can't put my finger
On what it might be
Might be truth and wisdom
Might be diamonds and gold
It might be the greatest story ever told
But the truth is I don't care
I just need a break and I swear
That it's just around the corner out there
Lately life's been laughing like a mean circus clown
Making jokes about me and trying to keep me down
But I'm saying bring it baby give me all you got
'Cause my time is a-comin', baby
For my one big shot
And if I'm wrong, I don't care
You can't win playin' scared
It's just around the corner out there
The truth is I don't care
You can't win playing scared
It's just around the corner out there
Just around the corner
Just around the corner
Just around the corner out there
