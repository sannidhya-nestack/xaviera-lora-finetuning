I love you, so what you gonna do about it? Now you know it's true
Though you never had a clue about it, let me introduce some proof
Just watch me watching you, I'm a regular Hawkeye
Catch me, catch my breath whenever you walk by
I've tried slicking demure, hoping you'd bite
Now I'm kicking the door wide open and I, I love you
So what you gonna do about it?
It's your move
So what you gonna do about it? Stop teasing me
Oh, you must admit that you allowed it
You didn't cop a plea or flee
You never let me let you keep your distance
You showed me that your show ain't no resistance
I'm sincerely a pearl
Sweet as a pie, merely a girl
Sweet on a guy, I love you
So what you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
Hmm, good question
What you gonna do about it?
You got a suggestion?
What you gonna do about it?
When can we start?
What you gonna do?
Don't you break my heart!
I love you
So what you gonna do about it
Now you know it's true
Though you never had a clue about it
Let me introduce some proof
You never let me let you keep your distance
You show me that you're sure with no resistance
I'm sincerely a pearl
Sweet as a pie, I'm merely a girl
Sweet on a guy, I love you
So what you gonna do about it, about it, about it, about it?
What you gonna do about it?
Hmm, I'll be right over
