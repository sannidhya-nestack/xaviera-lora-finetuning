You couldn't hurt me if you tried
It's been a long, long time since I cried
You cannot cut me inside
You couldn't hurt me if you tried
You'd be so easy to et
Just like lighting up another cigarette
Tears here in my eyes aren't wet
You'll be so easy to et
You'll be so easy to et
There's no way my heart can break
And I don't believe in heartache
Years ago a woman tore my heart out and walked away
There's no heart here
There's no heart here
There's no heart here left to break
So you see
You couldn't hurt me if you tried
It's been a long, long time since I cried
You cannot cut me inside
You couldn't hurt me if you tried
You couldn't hurt me
You could not hurt me, no, no
You couldn't hurt me if you tried
