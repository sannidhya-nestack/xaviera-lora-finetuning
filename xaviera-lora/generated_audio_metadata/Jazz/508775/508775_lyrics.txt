I've been dreaming of a girl like you
You say yes, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll sing you a tune and buy you the moon
If you'll only wear my ring
Step this way and we'll dance in style
Just say yes and give me a smile
Give me a kiss, I'll be floating in bliss
If you'll only be my gal
So many nights waiting by the phone
Nobody home, just me alone
I want a honey to spend my money
Someone to call my own
The sunset's glow has gone away, another cold and lonely day
Where is the girlie who'll come home early and share a cup of tea with me?
I'm in heaven now, we've named the day
She's my steady and I'll never stray
She's my gal and I'm her foal, that's how it's gotta stay
A cute little cottage by the riverside
A lot of flowers for an April bride
My gal and me are as happy as can be
And she's my stay home gal
So many nights waiting by the phone
Nobody home just me alone
I want a honey to spend my money
Someone to call my own
The sun sets glow has gone away
Another cold and lonely day
Where is the girl who'll come home early
And share a cup of tea with me
I'm in heaven now, we've named the day
She's my steady and I'll never stray
She's my gal and I'm her bull
That's how it's gonna stay
A cute little cottage by the riverside
A lot of flowers for an April bride
My gal and me are as happy as can be
And she's my stay home gal
