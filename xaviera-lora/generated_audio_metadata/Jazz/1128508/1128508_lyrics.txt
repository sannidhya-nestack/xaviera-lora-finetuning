Who knows the reasons
Love can change just like the seasons
It can catch you in a rain storm with no code
The clouds on the horizon
You might try to keep your eyes on
Still you soon may feel that cold air deep in your throat
We had the spring of heat and passion
Where romance was the fashion
Flowers bloomed and green leaves sprouted on the trees
Summertime was golden
Autumn chill we tried to hold on
Now love is falling down like winter leaves
Winter leaves on the ground
The sorrow surrounds me
I know love may come again
If my heart still believes
Now the wounds are still raw
But emotions may thaw
I'll see how I feel when winter leaves
Winter leaves on the ground
The sorrow surrounds me
I know I may love again
If my heart still believed
I have no one to hold me
My mood's cloudy and stormy
We'll see how I feel when winter leaves
We'll see how I feel when winter leaves
