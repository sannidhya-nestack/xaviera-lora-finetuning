I've been keeping your letters under my pillow
I've been keeping my love up on the shelf
I'm happy tonight just passing the time
Dancing with you all by myself
I still remember the night we promised each other
Not to dance with anyone else
Now you know how I'm keeping the vow
Dancing with you all by myself
And the radio's playing our favorite song
I close my eyes, you are kissing me
I've been missing you darling
For oh so long and I pray
You are still missing me
So I'll spin me around one more time slowly
To that melody we know so well
Till you are here
I'll dream of you dear and be dancing with you all by myself
Well, the radio's playing our favorite song
I close my eyes, you are kissing me
I've been missing you darling for oh so long
And I pray you are still missing me
So spin me around one more time slowly
To that melody we know so well
'Til you are here, I'll dream of you dear
And be dancing with you all by myself
