You come, go, you run so appealing
The laughter thereafter revealing
No matter what you say love
Today love should be just for me
This is the start of a new romancing
Like a beautiful bird of paradise
Moving, changing all your points of view
It's known used to me
Many have chosen you
But there's no
Compared to be found
Like the sun adores the heavens
I too adore you only
Won't you be my one and only
Enduring love
Don't be slow
We both know the answer
To work dear, it's quite clear
We transfer
all our little schemes and our dreams
That we share without care
Could be the start of a new romancing
Like a beautiful bird of paradise
Moving, changing all your points of view
It's no news to me, many have chosen you
But there's no compare to be found
Like the sun adores the heavens
I too adore you only
Won't you be my one and only enduring love?
Like the sun adores the heavens
I need to adore you only
Won't you be my one and only enduring love?
My enduring love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-ra-la, la, la-la-la.
