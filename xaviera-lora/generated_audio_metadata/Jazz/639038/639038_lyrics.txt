Since you went away
Oh, I've cried a little
Guess I've cried a lot, yeah
And I work to hide the pain
Yeah, I try a little
Guess I try a lot
Every day, every night
Every day, every night
I keep fighting through
But things don't improve, no
There's something missing in my life
It's all because
Because of you
When I hear our song
Oh I smile a little
Guess I smile a lot
All those good times in the sun
Baby we laughed a little
Yes we laughed a lot
Every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart beats in double time
For a love that's died, yeah yeah
There's something missing in my life
It's all because
Because of you
Every day, every night
Every day, every night I'll keep fighting through
But things don't improve, no, no
There's something missing in my life
It's all because, because of you
It's all because, because of you
