How long has it been since we kissed that night?
Since our love exchanged its deepest touch
And feeling one last time
How long has it been since I had a day
When my life was filled with happiness before you went away?
How long has it been since we were in love
Staring at the stars, dreams floating above
How long has it been since the sky was blue
Since I told you dear I'm in love with you
How long has it been
Since we said goodbye
Since I looked deep in your eyes
When you told me that we'd never go our separate ways
I believed you held it tightly every single day
the one you'd come fill each and every promise
Make it last forever
Forever is this what you asked for?
Is your promise just as good as before?
How long has it been since we were in love?
Staring at the stars, dreams floating above
How long has it been since the sky was blue?
Since I told you, dear, I'm in love with you
How long has it been since we kissed that night?
Since our love exchanged its deepest touch
And feeling one last time
How long has it been since I had a day
That you never went away
