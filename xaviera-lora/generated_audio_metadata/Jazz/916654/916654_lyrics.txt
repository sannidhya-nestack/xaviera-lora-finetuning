Well, now yesterday I heard a lover sigh
Goodbye, goodbye, oh me, oh my
And now seven times she got aboard his train
And seven times he held me back to kiss his love again
And tell her to, to, to say goodbye
Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't you cry
The choo-choo train that takes me
Away from you, no words can say how sad it makes me
Kiss me, Tootsie, and then
I won't try to get over again
When they watch for me, I never fail
If you don't get a letter, then you know I'm in jail
Ho, ho, toot, toot, tootsy, don't cry
Toot, toot, tootsy, goodbye
When I'm with somebody who says goodbye to me
I'm just as sad as I can be
But not so with this loving Romeo
Who seems to take a lot of pleasure saying goodbye to his treasure
Toot toot toot toot goodbye
Oh toot toot toot toot don't cry
That choo-choo train that takes me
Far away from you
No words can say how sad it makes me
Kiss me to death then
Won't you do it over again
And what's for the mare
I will never fear
If you don't get a letter
Then you know I'm in jail
Oh, oh, ta-ta-ta-ta don't cry
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-goodbye
