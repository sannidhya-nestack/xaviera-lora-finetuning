Moonlight in your eyes puts a spell on me and you don't even try
You know my air
To get to me like you do
You are everything I dreamed of
You're the one for me who sets me free of
Every pain I feel
You get to me like you do
You get to me like a melody to a song
I wanna hear it playing all night long
So please don't taste me
Just believe I love you
You know my every move
To get to me just like you do
Only you can get to me like you do
Like you do
For fun
