Lately your smile's been hanging
Upside down like a belt
So take that throne, turn it around
Baby don't you look like that
It don't feel too much like singing
But don't you worry if it's sharp or flat
You got my bells still ringing
Oh baby don't you look back there
'Cause even when you're cranky with a five-year-old bro
Still that same old face that I love somehow
When you're feeling like something that the cat drug in
With holes in your pocket that you just came in
Pouting your lips just like a monkey
You got a black cloud over your head
You got to lose that mood so funky
Baby don't you look like that
