Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Every single move, if you want to grow
Hold on now, we dance on the floor
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Every single move, if you want to grow
All the night we dance on the floor
Feel the town, turn around
Make your move, swing it upside down
