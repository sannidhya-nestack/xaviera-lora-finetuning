Late last night I went to bed
I pulled those covers over my head
I fell asleep like I was dead
But my sleep was interrupted
I dreamt a dream that terrorized
Long slimy whiskers, buggy eyes
A gaping mouth of awful size
Made me so disgusted
Oh, laudy, laudy, daddy gee
Get that catfish away from me
Can't you see he's scaring me
And he'll disturb my snooze
Hail that daddy, daddy G
Get that catfish away from me
Ain't you got the sense to see
You got the catfish nightmare blues?
It's all because my Daddy G thought the time was right for me
To see things I'm too young to see that lurk there in the deep
Well he took me to the fishing hole
The water boiled, the catfish rolled
Scared me so, now bless my soul, I see catfish in my sleep
Oh lordy lordy, Daddy G, get that catfish away from me
Can't you see he's scaring me and he'll disturb my snooze
Hey there Daddy, Daddy G, oh get that
Catfish away from me
Ain't you got the sense to see
I got the catfish nightmare blues
Oh, do you think that I'm immune from the terrors of cartoons?
Big ole' heads like ripe balloons will freak my little mind
It's bad enough I know they're there without you dragging them up here
Make me saw my underwear and old before my time
Oh lordy lordy daddy gee, get that catfish away from me
Can't you see, he's scaring me, and he'll disturb my snooze
Hey there daddy, daddy G, oh get that catfish away from me
Ain't you got the sense to see, I got the catfish nightmare blues
I got the catfish nightmare blues
