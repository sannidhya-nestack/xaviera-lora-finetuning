Let me tell you, son, let me tell you'bout a few things
About the man in the ivory towel and his puppet strings
If it pulls him once, you better jump and ask how high
If it pulls him twice, you better run'cause you're gonna die
Let me tell you something, let me tell you about the way it goes
You know the ivory man is the boss and everybody knows
He got a smile on one side and a knife on the other face
They'll cut you up in little pieces and spread you all over the place
They'll keep you locked up in a cage
They'll keep you looted at the bottom of the second page
They'll make you suffer just to pay
Yeah, you work till you die and you'll die to get away
I'd love to stay with you, son, but the man's calling, gotta go
Gotta shackle him up, pull the plow for Mr. So-and-So
Now if you're smarter than me you're gonna jump out the back door
Go on and get while you can cause I can't help you no more
If I could shelter you from the world son you know I would
You can cry if you want to but it won't do you no good
See when the man come callin' you got yourself a choice to make
You either take what's yours or it's yours that he's gonna take
They keep you locked up in a cage
They keep you lifted off the bottom of a second page
They'll make you suffer just to pay
Now you'll work till you die and you'll die to get away
Let me tell you son, let me tell you about a few things
About the man in the ivory towel and his puppet strings
If he pulls them once, you better jump and ask how high
If he pulls them twice, you better run cause you're gonna die
