Was it the trade winds that blew me here?
Clear sky, my clouded heart's unclear
How can this sun dazzled day shoot diamonds off the waves?
Even though I'm tumbling into blue
Rocky steps, slip down to the shore
So unsure, just what my heart is for
Jaded green sinking sand, a moon stone in my hand
Here I am, tumbling into blue
On a tide of swirling writers' story
Breaks free in its simplicity
How did life get so complicated, overwrought, overrated, mediocrity
If the child in me remembered how maybe I'd remember too
Rising tight just to see change passing through
Where you go, well that's where you are
On a beach beneath a burning star
When tides turn there will be a reason to believe
Diving in I'm tumbling into blue
On a tide of swirling, write a story
Breaks free in its simplicity
How did life get so complicated?
Over-wrought, overrated, mediocrity
If the child in me remembered how
Maybe I'd remember too
Rising tide just to see change passing through
Where you go, well that's where you are
On a beach, beneath a burning star
When tides turn there will be
A reason to believe
Until then, the wind
Will blow me back again
Tumbling into blue
Into blue
Into blue
