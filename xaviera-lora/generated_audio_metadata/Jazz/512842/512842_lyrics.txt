The sun goes down and night hits town
And you're on my mind
Oh and I wanna be with you
I can't sleep I walk the streets
Till I reach your place
And sing my street light serenade
The words of love seem to harmonize
With every cat I meet
And the passersby shake their heads and sigh
Who's that fool singing in the street?
But I don't care if they stop and stare
I want the world to hear
My street light serenade to you
Sun goes down
Night hits the town
You're on my mind
Baby baby oh I wanna be with you
Just can't sleep I walk the street
Till I reach your place
Singing my street light serenade
The words of love seem to harmonize
With every cat I meet
And the passers by shake their heads and sigh
That fool singing in the street
But I don't care if they stop and stare
I want the world to hear
My street light serenade to you
My street light serenade to you
