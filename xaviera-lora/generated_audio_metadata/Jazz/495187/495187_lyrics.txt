Lost my heart that star struck day
Now it's history
I should have told you I wanted you to stay
So you'd hear it from me
Thought my foolish face would tell
It makes the case quite clear
I should've told you, oh how hard I fell
When you hit the atmosphere
Guess you're the last to hear
Some things, like the breath we take, seem to need no mention
But just so there is no mistake, I will state my intention
Love for you I'll drag and slay
Brave the raging sea
If I can have and hold you anyway
Any day that you are free
Now you've heard it from me
Lost my heart that star struck day
Now it's history
I should have told you I wanted you to stay
So you'd hear it from me
Thought my foolish face would tell
It makes the case quite clear
I should have told you, oh how hard I fell
When you hit the atmosphere
Guess you're the last to hear
Some things, like the breath we take, seem to need no mention
But just so there is no mistake, I will state my intention
Love for you I'll drag and slay, brave the raging sea
If I can't have and hold you anyway
Any day that you are free
Now you've heard it from me
Now you've heard it from me
Now you've heard it from me
