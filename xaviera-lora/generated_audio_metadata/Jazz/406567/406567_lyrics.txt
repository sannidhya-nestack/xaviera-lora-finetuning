We're even now, can we just drop the whole thing
We're even now, no need to waste your time
When you broke my heart I knew
That hindsight's a better view
And I hope by now you realize it too
We're even now, don't even think about it
We're even now, what comes around goes around
When you saw me with somebody new
We were having a grand debut
You see that game you play can be played by two
It's childish to be spiteful
Can't we be friends
Let's bury the old hatchet
Here's where the bad blood ends
We're even now
We're even Steven
We're even now
And I believe in
It's good we're even now
We're even now, let's just et about it
We're even now, go bug somebody else
When you slashed my tires I knew
What I thought were idle threats were true
And you'll act on them after you've had a few
We're even now, I'm done stalking your condo
We're even now, and you won't catch me snooping around
Your security system works well, your neighbors are annoyed as hell
And your OBD-unt doberman knows my smell
It's childish to be spiteful
Can we be friends?
Let's bury the old hatchet
Here's where the bad blood ends
We're even now
Let's call the ball game
We're even now
Let's call it same same
It's good we're even now
I'm glad we're even now
Telling you we're even now
