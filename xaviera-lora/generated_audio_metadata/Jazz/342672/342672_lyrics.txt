Is it strong enough, is it strong enough, is it strong enough, is it strong enough to save me
Is it strong enough to save me
Is it strong enough to save me?
Inside the counterline
Of this life I left behind
Inside the counter of this life I left behind
Is it strong enough to save me?
Of all things must be the goal
If not then again when?
And so if not then again when?
And conscious
Flashing through my mind
Flashing through my mind
Is it strong enough?
Strong enough to save me?
Inside the candlelight
Of this life I left behind
And the day dawned left me blind
It can plug your veins and eyes
Is it strong enough
To save me
Of all things
Must be the goal
If not
Then again when
The self
If not
Then again when
Conscious anguish
Yet
Cannot see
Flashing through my mind
Yet
Cannot see, lashing through my mind
Of this life I left behind
Cannot see, lashing through my mind
Of this life I left behind
Lashing through my mind
Of this life I left behind
Cannot see, lashing through my mind
One more ride and one more road
And one more jug of wine
Is it strong enough to save me?
Strong enough to save me?
Is it strong enough to save me?
Inside the counter life
Of this life I left behind
To save me
Inside the counter life
Of this life I left behind
Is it strong enough to save me?
Is it strong enough to save me?
Of all things, must be the goal
If not, can a game win itself?
If not, can a game win unconscious?
One more ride, one more jug of wine
