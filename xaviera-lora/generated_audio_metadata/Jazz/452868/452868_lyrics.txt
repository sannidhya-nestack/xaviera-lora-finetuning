I'm as beautiful as I thought you were
All is pain, tainting my view
How can I ignore what I feel?
Negating the only thing that is real
I can't undo what's been done
I can't unfeel what I now feel
I can't unchange what's forever changed
It's all too late, it's all slipped away
Oh, slipped away
Oh, slipped away
Away
It's all slipped away, all slipped away
All slipped away
I can't undo what's been done
I can't unfeel what did not feel
I can't unchange what's forever changed
It's all too late, it all slipped away
Oh, slipped away
Oh, slipped away, away
My tongue was numb, I couldn't say
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't articulate
I could not resonate
I needed space and time to see
But when I took a breath, I just screamed
