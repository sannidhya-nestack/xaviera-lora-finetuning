You got caught in the syncopate
The counterpoint you had to chase
An added 13th, an added 9th
Won't diminish your augment of life
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
You blow through your ears, it's all you got
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
And each can be both just pray you don't get lost
Amen, Amen, Amen
The cold sweats, the narcotic dreams
Hallucinating and spiraling
Running around and around
Out chasing down the good to escape the bad
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
You blow through your ears, it's all you've got
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
And each can be both, just pray you don't get lost
Amen, Amen, Amen
A single love can be a beautiful thing
Don't have to freestyle to make it sing
Listen out for the space in between
That's where the magic begin, begin
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
You blow through your ears, it's all you got
Cool can be hot and hot can be cool
And each can be both just pray you don't get lost
Amen, Amen, Amen
You don't play life, it plays you
You don't orchestrate a score you feel isn't you
Let your heart beat a rhythm that finds its time
You might wander'round a melody that's kind
You paid the price for the choices you made
The man upstairs felt you had to be saved
You left a legacy, notes and grace
That bebop thing, you can't ever find its place
Cool can be hot, and hot can be cool
You blow us through your ears, it's all you've got
Cool can be hot, and hot can be cool
And each can be both, just pray you don't get lost
Amen, amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, One time, Amen, Amen, Amen
