Out there
Show me the way please
Show me the way, oh
For help
The way to the light (Show me the way to the light)
Reach for the sky (You will take flight)
The way to the light
Reach for the sky (Retract the cycle)
You will take flight
The way, the way to the light (The flame is on the place of hate)
Reach for the sky
You will take flight
There one day you'll take (The way to the light)
Reach for the sky, changed everything
Then one day you came and changed everything
You were sentencing me from my place of pain
One day you came, changed everything
Save me from a place of pain
Love's not a lie
Showin' me the way to the light
Show me the way, baby, show me the way
