His face was black, he smoked Lucky Charms
He sat way in back, folded his arms
I couldn't help but notice him straight away
He looked at me so intensely like I was on display
So I stepped up and played my composition with much conviction
And the cool jazz kid just laughed when he heard it
Like it wasn't nothing he ain't heard before
Yes, the cool jazz cat just laughed when he heard it
So I played it again and the cool jazz cat sat in
So I've sung my song, he played along
I bought him a couple drinks
And then he was gone, he just vanished right into thin air
It's like a dream, though it might seem quite real up there
As we're just jammin' away and gettin' groovy
Like in a movie
And the cool jazz cat is just laughin'
Ain't nothin' you can play that he ain't played before
Yes, the cool jazz cat just laughs if he likes it
And if you play it again, well, the cool jazz cat
Just might find the time to go ahead and sit on in
