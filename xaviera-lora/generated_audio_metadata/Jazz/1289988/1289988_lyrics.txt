Sky on fire like a painted dream
Every shade a secret scheme
Sun sinks low into the sea
Nighttime whispers calling me
Sunsets glow, it lights the way
Takes the worries of the day
Colors dance in twilight's trance
Lost in this romance
Bone streaks blaze against the night
Hold your hand, it feels so right
As the light begins to fade
Echoes of the day, parley
Starting to fade
Old stories in the night's window
Silent promises we keep
Underneath the sky so deep
Final race, they bid goodbye
Splash of pink across the sky
In your eyes, the colors bloom
Chasing away the doom, doom
Final rays, they bid goodbye
Splash of pink across the sky
In your eyes the colours bloom
Chasing away the doom, doom
