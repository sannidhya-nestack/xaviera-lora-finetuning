Every moment I spend with you
Is a moment I'll never have again
A moment to tell you
That I love you
A moment to let you know
How much I care
And a moment to thank you
Thank you for always being there, there for me
Do you know?
Can you hear my voice?
Do you know that I'm here?
Can you feel my touch?
Every moment I spend with you is a moment I'll never have again
A moment to tell you that I love you
A moment to let you know I'll always be there
And a moment to be
Just to be, to be with you one last time
Every moment I spend with you is a moment I'll never have again
