He's a horned dog, born to wail, morning, noon, and night
Oh well, a dorm dog, shabby coat and tails, quite a fetching sight
I'll bet you'd agree that he's a pedigree
A breed that stands alone
So throw that dog a cornet, a trumpet, a trombone
And watch that horned dog blow
He's a horned dog, not a stray, no
And he don't bite
Ben's best friend, he blows away every dog inside
Dressed to the canines, blue ribbon every time
And all the cats line up to see the show
He's into the pop, lickin' his tops, diggin' up hot pops solo
Blow hard dog blow
He's a horned dog, how he howls
Now that he's unleashed
Italian born dog, chow wow wow
Cute to boot, capiche
Offer him a treat
He'll curl up at your feet
He'll play so sweet
He'll make you beg for more
He's doing his trick
Learn the tricks that are in me by sight
Whoa, blonde dog love
Blonde dog love
Blonde dog love
