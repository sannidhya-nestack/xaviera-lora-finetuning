Come on now sad face
Come on now tears
Where's the dreamer now?
After all these years
Older or any wiser
Does the flame still burn inside
Can you still dig deep
Do you still believe
You've a life still left to breathe
Seems we fade in and we fade out
Like ghosts upon a stage
etting all our lives
Our entrances, our place
Retracing life, listing mistakes
Chances that we didn't take
Are you wondering now how much time you have
Which exit you will take
In every word, in every sentence
On every page that's ever turned
The story's what you make it
Lessons to be learned in every chapter
Every paragraph, every line and every verse
Can you still find that fire?
Do you still burn?
Letters in an alphabet, indentations made
Breathing life into a page, lines run a curvature shape
We stumble, cover, we erase
Words in error, poorly phrased
We struggle with the impact
A few simple words can make
And every word and every sentence
On every place that's ever turned
The storm is what you make it
Lessons to be learned in every chapter
Every paragraph, every line and every verse
Can you still find that fire?
Do you still burn?
Don't go taking everything to heart
Let it tear you apart
Those pages turn, we long, we yearn
And we still learn
All those lives we've touched, those lives gone by
Carried a flame inside
Composition is it dead
Just let go what's in your head
These days the language different
Still with the same intent
And even though you've mellowed well
You've still things left to say
Maybe now with understanding
And the wisdom of your age
In every word and every sentence
On every page that's ever turned
The story's what you make it
Lessons to be learned in every chapter
Every paragraph, every line and every verse
Can you still find that fire
Do you still burn
Do you still burn?
Do you still burn?
