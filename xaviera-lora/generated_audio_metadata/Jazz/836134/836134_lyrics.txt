Diner talk, diner chat
Onion rings or fries with that counterculture
Three AM, neckin' in the back booth, booth
And the tattooed Boss Boy, guess why
Mickey in the kitchen flips cheeseburgers deluxe
Those truck stop diner walls have seen it all
Anywhere USA
Oh what would that diner say
If we could hear that diner talk
Diner chat
Will it be sweet to a match
Hey let's get hitched
Let's call it quits
Let's chip in for the tip
Whip me up a chocolate shake, love
Then I gotta go
Don't you know you got a beautiful mind?
Oh, the lines are diner here's
Through the years
Could fill a million coffee urns
Oh, what do you think we'd learn
If we could hear that diner tell its tale?
I've got a script for sale
Comedy, drama, slapstick boss
Cast of no-name stars
Old diner talk is cheap (cheap)
The rich in history lend me an ear
And hear a little diner talk, diner chat
Kiss my grits, hey slick, nice hat
Last chance for love'til the breakfast rush
What I want ain't on the menu, can you toast my buns?
Why surely, hun?
The customer's always right
That open on that diner's part of America's heart
I'm hoping it's here to stay
Oh what would that diner say
If we could hear that diner tell its tale
I've got a script for sale
Comedy, drama, slapstick boss
A cast of no-name stars
Oh, Danny Talk is cheap, cheap
But rich in history
Let me add you
And here we'll add you
Danny Talk
Whoa, Danny Talk
Ooh, diner talk, diner talk
Whoa, diner talk, diner talk
