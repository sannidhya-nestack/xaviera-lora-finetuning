Share with me this night
Under tropical skies in this harbor of love
Where the mountain meets the sea
Where the ocean meets the shore
A meeting place for lips
That's what I'm here for
Share with me this dream
In this tropical breeze
In this harbor of love
Where the sweet hibiscus grow
Just you and me alone
A meeting place for hearts
Love's tender flame to start
In this rapture
The palm trees all whisper your name
With a sign
I am captured
So helplessly drawn to the light
In your eyes
Why oh why did I spend those years yearning
My oh my but I feel my heart turning
With each kiss heaven knows that I'm learning
To fly so high
Share with me this life
By this turquoise sea and mango sky
Where the present meets the past
While you are holding me fast
A meeting place for hips
And hearts and arms and lips
Harbour of love
Harbour of love
Harbor of love
