I wanna be James Dean with insolent lips
Black leather jacket and a swagger to my hips
I wanna crash head on but it's too late to die young
I wanna come unhinged from a broken heart
Just like Ferophilia, struck down by Cupid's dart
But I survived that scene, so it's too late to die young
It's romantic, tragic, publicity magic
To go when you're in your prime
'Cause people can't spin who you could have been
If you'd only had more time
So I wanna be Amelia Earhart
Scarf trailing in the wind
Lost circling forever
A jaunty heroine
I wanna fly into the sun
But it's too late to die young
I wanna be James Dean with insolent lips
Black leather jacket and a swagger to my hips
I wanna crash head on but it's too late to die young
I wanna come unhinged from a broken heart
Just like Ferophilia, struck down by Cupid's dart
But I survived that scene, so it's too late to die
It's romantic, tragic, publicity magic to go when you're in your prime
people can't spin who you could have been if you only had more time
So I wanna be Amelia Earhart
Scarf trailing in the wind
Lost circling forever
A jaunty heroine
I wanna fly into the sun
But it's too late
I think it might be a little too late
Or maybe a lot too late
Be young!
