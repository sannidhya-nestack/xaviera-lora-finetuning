I can spot your silky peek-a-boo
From a mile or two, you're a thief in high heels
You make all the boys hoot and catterwall
Yeah, I'm bound to fall, I wanna know how it feels
Oh, you're a bad
Girl, in a very good way, you get the gist of it
Come on and love me a bit
You're like a boxer with a light side left hook
Yeah, you connected and shook me and I'm feeling, feeling it
Your hotness stands up
Rising steam gonna have me a dream
While the dreaming is good
I'll find your sweet spot if you let me look
Yeah we're starting to cook chicken under the hood
Oh you baby
In all the right ways, you get the gist of it
Come on and love me a bit
You're like a Mack truck, running wild on the street
From my head to my feet, baby, I'm feeling, feeling hit
You'll work just fine in my fantasy
I can guarantee you're always running on time
So make me a promise that you'll stick around
For another round and another rhyme
Oh you bad girl
In all the right ways you got the gist of it
Come on and love me a bit
Babe Ruth, a swingin' full of fans
You clubbed my common sense
Baby I'm feelin', feelin' hit
I'm feelin' hit
Feelin' hit, yeah, yeah
