Was it love or only tenderness
Were we in something less than love?
Was it love, the thrill that made us feel
That what we had was really love?
Our hearts were so sure it could be
So sure it would not be long
That after tonight it would be
So how could two hearts be wrong?
Was it love that made it feel so right?
Just touching could excite a soul
Was it love that we made last night?
I wonder if we'll ever know
Our hearts were so sure it could be
So sure it would not be long
That after tonight it would be
So how could two hearts be wrong?
Was it love that made it feel so right?
Just touching could excite a soul
Was it love that we made last night
I wonder if we'll ever know
