Can my love for you
Be measured in a dandelion's flight
And why do moonbeams
Insist upon the darkness of night
And if the rings of love could be counted like the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me?
And would we do it again
If we knew where our way love would lead us
But like a dandelion's flight
And the darkness of night
Love took command
Love held our hand
So let's give love a chance
And let's make romance
'Cause it would be tragic to lose this sweet magic that we know so well
So let's just close the door and make love like we made before
And like a dandelion's flight in the darkness of night let's fly away
Let's fly away today
