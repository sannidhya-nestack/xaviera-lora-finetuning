Running through a hole like a bootlegging mouse in a roadside mountain hotel
Well the cats in the corner got the guns and the speed but they're too young to know how to sell
Flags are flying high in the eastern sky where the roads are all covered in sin
Now I'm yelling at you like a banshee with blood all over my shins
The only way to live is to love again or just burn out in love's flame
Music and words will kill me or save me once again
Spending money like a rich kid
Drinking like a camel's hump
Loving you like a dead man or a rider stuck in a slump
Well I wrote this song on the back of a bag that once held a bottle of gin
Now you gamble somewhere between heaven and hell waiting to cash it all in
The only way to live is to love again
Or just burn out in love's flame
Music and words will kill me
Or save me once again
Now I can't stand up on you all
Sit down
Everything about you has turned out way too loud
The only way to live is to love again and just burn out in love's flame
Music and words will kill me or save me once again
Music and words will kill me or save me once again
Music and words will kill me or save me once again
