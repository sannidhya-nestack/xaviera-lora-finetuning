Living a kind of dream
I can take you right with me
Where do I wanna be?
Ocean and a sky between
A ticket to go away
I can't complain
Nothing I have to say
Don't wanna wake
La da
La da
Na
Living a kind of dream
I can't take you right with me
Where do I wanna be?
Ocean and a sky between
A ticket to go away
I can't complain
Nothing I have to save
Don't want to wait
Da de da da da da da
Da de da de
Da de da da de da
A ticket to go away
I can't complain
Nothing I have to save
Don't want to wait
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, da, da, da, da, da
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
