There's a little place just outside of town
Where we like to go when we get lonely
Just a hideaway where you can kick back and relax
When the sun goes down they come from miles around
Just to cuddle up in some dark corner
Or perhaps to dance you can just kick back and relax
What's the sense in staying home with the blues
Feeling low down, lonely, sad and confused
Come on out and lose all your cares
And call up some friends
Come on out and hear a little music
When you're feeling low
It's the place to go
And you can't et about your troubles
Ain't no worries there
You can just kick back and relax
What's the sense in staying home with the blues
Feeling low down, lonely, sad and confused
Come on out and lose all your cares
Call up some friends
Come on out and hear a little music
When you're feeling low
It's the place to go
And you can et about your troubles
Ain't no worries there
You can just kick back and relax
Ain't no worries there
You can just kick back and relax
Relax
Be-be-be-be, be-be-be-be, be-bebe-be, be-be-be-ben
