As she lays next to you
Asleep in your bed
I am with you too
Asleep in your head
When I wake this morning
You will be there too
Next to her perhaps
But beside me too
As you turned in the night
Your skin touched hers
Its warmth and its softness
Yearned and yearned
But as your hands hold her body
It is mine you caress
And it is me you undress
Dawn, come and rescue me
Save me from the misery
Take this broken heart and mend it
Dawn
Only you can end it
Dawn, come and rescue me
As you break the sky
Dawn, you set me free
The pain grows stronger as the days go by
I let you go, I don't know why
Didn't think you loved me, couldn't see past fear
You took another, say she's not me
As the days get longer
From months to years
Only the darkest hours
See my tears
It's a spoken story
That's been sung before
But it's my first time dying
My first time alone, darling
Come, come and rescue me
Save me from the misery
Take this broken heart
And mend it, dawn, only you can end it, dawn
Come and rescue me as you break the sky, dawn
You set me free
