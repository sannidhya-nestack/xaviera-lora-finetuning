(flute music)
Give me three-lane highways with stopover facilities
Transcontinental with a turbo shift
Mobile handset, a tongue-free air guard
A little plastic money if you get my drift
Coach station cartels and girls that spend their money bending plastic cards
Boy they were born to shop, sales that never end
The restless ever movement, the high street gossip and the six foot cop
Give me city life
Full of restless hearts
Give me city life
Where the pressure starts
City life, full of restless hearts
Give me city life, where the pressure starts
Give me back street bars and run down cars
And all the brief encounters of those TV stars
Girls in black laces with suntanned faces
Legs that promise everything with looks to kill
Now guys in leathers and some of them in feathers
Some you just can't tell if it's a guy or a girl
On sweet routines, heavy dudes in tight jeans
Shark-infested subways and a million dreams
Give me City Life
Full of restless hearts
Give me City Life
Where the pressure starts
City Life
Is full of restless hearts
City life, where that pressure starts
City life, full of restless hearts City life, where the pressure starts
Back tax maybes and other people's babies
On the posters for the clean air anywhere but here
On the phone on the young on the run they're in flight
With the in flight magazines on how to do it
Screaming the news with the views on the views
On that city life issues of the down and out
I'm on my way today you gotta dare
Don't start without me read'em and weep
Gimme room gimme room gimme
City life, full of restless hearts
City life, where the pressure starts
City life, full of restless hearts
City life, where the pressure starts
