Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swing it upside down
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swing it upside down
Every single move makes you want to grow
Hold on now we're down from the floor
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Feel the sound, turn around
Make your moves, swinging upside down
Every single move, if you want to move
All the time we dance on the floor
Feel the sound turn around
Make it move swinging upside down
Feel the sound turn around
Make it move swinging upside down
Every single move makes you want to grow
All the time we dance on the floor
