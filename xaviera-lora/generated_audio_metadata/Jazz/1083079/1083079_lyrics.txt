You can't love me'cause I'm sad, distressed, and lonely
But you fail to see that I'm your one and only
I can see it in your face how you deplore me, ignore me, ignore me
Kinda sad how you reject my natural beauty
I can't reflect the image you want to see
All you need to do is be accepting of me
Restore me, restore me
If you'd take the time begin to just explore me
Your discovery would cause you to implore me
Then you'd find out that the truth is you adore me
Adore me, adore me
You can't love me'cause I'm sad, distressed and lonely
But you fail to see that I'm your one and only
I can see it in your face how you deplore me, ignore me, ignore me
Kinda sad how you reject my natural beauty
I can't reflect the image you want to see
All you need to do is be accepting of me, restore me, restore me
If you'd take the time again to just explore me
Your discovery would cause you to implore me
Then you'd find out the truth is you adore me, adore me, adore me
