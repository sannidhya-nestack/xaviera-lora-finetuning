Hear the call, love is near, it's all
We need tonight, glowing in the moonlight
Soft shadows fall in a world where silence speaks
Gentle harmony our hearts meet
Whispered breezes softly play this nighttime symphony
Moonlit whispers sail across the sea
Whispered breezes softly play this nighttime symphony
Moonlit whispers sail across the sea
Hear the call, love is near, it's all we need tonight
Glowing in the moonlight
Gentle melodies
Dancing on the waves like tender dreams
In this moment, everything's surreal
Hear the call, love is near, it's all we need
Tonight, glowing in the moonlight
Stars twinkle bright, your hand in mine, we greet the night
Hearts intertwine, in rhythm sway, as dreams take flight
Hear the call, love is near, it's all we need
Tonight, glowing in the moonlight
