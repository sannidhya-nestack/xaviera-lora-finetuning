Get up in the morning, round about two
I can't sleep'cause I'm thinking of you
Still awake at a quarter to three
I don't know what's wrong with me
In your mind you cannot trust
When it starts to feel that lust
I want your body, I want your soul
I want it now and I want it all, yeah
Night is warm, moon is new
I am threading through and through
I can't get high, I can't come down
My mind is spinning round and round
Come on baby don't hesitate
You know tomorrow may be too late, there's no need to be afraid
You and me have got it made, oh
I just want to take you, baby
I just want to take you, baby
I wanna take you, boy
I just want to take you, babe
Hell, I'm done
Get up in the morning around about two
I can't sleep cause I'm thinking of you
Still awake at a quarter to three
I don't know what's wrong with me
The night is warm, moon is new
I'm running through and through, I can't get high, I can't come down
My mind is spinning around and around, I just want to take you baby
I just want to take you baby, I just want to take you boy
I just want to take you by the
I just want to, I just want to
I just want to take you baby
I just want to take you boy
I just want to take you by the hand
