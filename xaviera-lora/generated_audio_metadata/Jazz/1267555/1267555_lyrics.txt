After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You feel blue, you feel sad
You miss the dearest pal you ever had
There'll come a time now don't et it
There'll come a time when you regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away
After I'm gone, after we break up
After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
After the years we've been together
Through joy and tears all kinds of weather
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away
You'll feel blue and you'll feel sad
You miss the dearest pal you ever had
Someday when you've grown lonely
Your heart will break like mine
And you want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away
You made me sad and blue
But now I'm through with you
And there's nothing more you can say
So Jack, be on your way
Miss Ella's okay
