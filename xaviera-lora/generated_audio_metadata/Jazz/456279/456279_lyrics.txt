Every step of the way
I get a little closer
I was lost and in a daze
Life couldn't get much darker
A broken heart can't stop you from seeing the truth
But then I realized where I was going was never for you
After you said goodbye
I faced my darkest hours
I still get numb to the pain
Every once in a while
I'll remember your smile
Until my days are through
That's why every step of the way
I get closer to the memory of you
(Vocalizing)
After you said goodbye I faced my darkest hours
I still get numb to the pain every once in a while
I'll remember your smile until my days are through
That's why every step of the way
I get closer to the memory of you
