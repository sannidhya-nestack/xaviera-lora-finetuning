Gentle breezes make music in the trees
Sending songs of evening through the air
Shadows play at the end of day
From darkness you appear
Bermuda moon
You hypnotize me
Your silver beams across the sea
Bermuda moon, you mystify me
You bring alive my fantasy
The sun is fading, the sky is waiting
For the light of the stars to shine
Lovers dance under your spell of romance
Feeling magic in the night
Bermuda moon, you hypnotize me
Your silver beams across the sea
Bermuda moon, you mystify me
My silent friend and I
Spinning dreams into a diamond sky
You bring a light
My fantasy
