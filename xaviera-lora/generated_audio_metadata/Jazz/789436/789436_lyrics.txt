Better clear the floor now
They're coming through the door now
Well it's Mary and James
They got no shame
They're born to dance
Right out of the crib
You can't split that partnership
Those two are
Jawed at the hip
Jawed at the hip
Lip to lip
Fingertip to tip
But when the band begins, they're like zombies, twins that cat
And his contract goes to a joint at the hip, hip
You can't separate'em
that's the way God made'em
They're like a mighty mole
(Beaty, beaty, mighty mole)
They're like a potty and hole
(Hotty, hotty, hotty hole)
They trip the light like a standing tramp
Skip, skip, let's trip, let's let those two out
Jawed at the hip
Jawed at the hip
Lip to lip
Fingertip to tip
When the band begins it like Siamese twins
That cat and his tongue ticked off
Still we're joined at the hip, hip
They swept each other off their feet and went out for a spin
And since that day they cut the cake there ain't no one cutting in
Those two are joined at the hip
Joined at the hip
Lip to lip
Fingertips to tip
When the band begins they're like Siamese twins
That cat and his car check those two are joined at the hip
Jawed at the hip
Jawed at the hip
Jawed at the hip
When the band begins to lock some of these twins like cat and his club chick goes to a jawed at the hip
