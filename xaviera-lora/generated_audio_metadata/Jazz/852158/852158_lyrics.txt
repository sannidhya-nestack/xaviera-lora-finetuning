Hello, the weather is sunny
Look up, oh what a clear day
Sparrows flying happy over me
Flowers are blooming around us
And you can't stop laughing at things
The way they have turned to be
Oh, oh what a day
Kind of magic is in the air
I feel like flying away
Like two kinds, just me and you, hooray
Hello, the sun is shining
Through trees, rays are sparkling
I feel happiness all around me
Oh what a day, I feel like floating away
As a cloud so light, you make me feel like this today
Hello, the weather is sunny, look up
Oh what a clear day, sparrows flying happy over me
Oh what a day, I feel like floating away
As a cloud so light, you make me feel like this today
Hello, the weather is sunny
Look up, oh what a clear day
Sparrows flying happy home for me
Oh, oh what a day
Kind of magic is in the air
I feel like flying away
Like two kites, just me and you, hooray
Hello, the sun is shining through trees
Rays are sparkling, I feel happiness all around me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
