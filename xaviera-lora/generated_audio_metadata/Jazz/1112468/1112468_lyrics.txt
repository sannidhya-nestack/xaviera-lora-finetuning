Oh, the big city lights don't keep me out half the night like they used to
Now it's champagne with brunch, girl, you've softened my touch since I met you
Mmm, one little kiss put me in a bliss
No, I've never felt this way
Oh darling, what a difference love can make
Now I'm flying high, not a cloud in the sky
Look at me, girl
I know that I am the luckiest man in the whole world
You came along like a beautiful song
Hear the bluebird serenade
Oh darling, what a difference love can make
Now when I see a falling star
I catch it with my heart
And I dream of you all night long
Flowers blooming, smell of spring
Soon the wedding bells will ring
Oh darling, what a difference love can make
Now when I see a falling star I catch it with my heart
And I dream of you all night long
Flowers blooming, smell of spring
Soon the wedding bells will ring
Oh darling, what a difference
How I've been longing for this day
Oh darling, what a difference love can make
What a difference you've made in my life
Ah, what a difference love can make
