It's a drop in the ocean
A pinch of salt in the sea
One tiny star in heaven
That means the whole world to me
A million words you can tell me
But if I could choose only three
It's when you snuggle up to me and say, "I'm so happy"
I know it would be easy for me to tell you how I love your style
But when you say to me, "I'm so happy" it's even better than a smile
I know that I'm so lucky
When I hold you close to me
And hear you whispering to me
Baby, I'm so happy
A million words you can tell me
Oh but if I could choose only three
It's when you snuggle up to me
And say I'm so happy
Well I know it would be so easy for me
To tell you how I love your style
But when you say to me I'm so happy
It's even better than a smile
I know that I'm so lucky
When I hold you close to me
And hear you whispering to me
Baby, I'm so happy
Baby, I'm so happy
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I'm so happy
