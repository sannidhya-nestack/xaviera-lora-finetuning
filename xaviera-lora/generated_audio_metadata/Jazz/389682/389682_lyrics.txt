When I was a boy I dreamed I could be
A doctor or lawyer perchance
But since I saw you I've put aside books
And now study the art of romance
How lonesome my life could have possibly been
My only concern was my work
But with you in my arms
No doubt I would be
The luckiest man on the earth
Fortune and fame and seeing the sights
The only dreams I would pursue
But now I spend my days and spend my nights
Dreaming of a girl named you
As I grow old and wiser in ways
It's peculiar now that I find
It's not in my head but deep in my heart
That's where I can have peace of mind
It came to me, alone I would be
Spending the rest of my life
But I worry no more, for I became yours
The day you agreed to be my wife
Now there is no longer fear in my heart
For I follow this one simple rule
He who has love is miles apart
For the lover is the wise or not the fool
Fortune and fame and seeing the signs
The only dreams I would pursue
But now I spend my days, spend my nights
Dreaming with a girl named you
Fortune and fame, the sea and the science
The only dreams I would pursue
But now I spend my days, spend my nights
Dreaming with my girl named you
I spend my days, I spend my nights
Dreaming with my girl
Dreaming with my girl named you
