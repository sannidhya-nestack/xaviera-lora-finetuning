Chris White shirt, styling tie, jacket slacks
Shoes that shine, studs light, mountain eyes
Cotton's half-fucked up or not you got long sleeve
French cuff, studly-cutly, sensuous
Hey guys, three words can't go wrong with Chris White shirt
Women will confirm if you wanna make heads turn
Boyfriends do get jealous, I'm telling you now
So listen up fellas, silk may show you hustle
And tease may show you muscle
But the guy, the girl's a-choosin'
Is wearin' that brand new Van Heusen crisp white shirt
Stylin' tight, jacket slacks, shoes that shine
Starched slide, mountain eyes
Cotton's hot but not for night you got long sleeve
French cup, studly, cuddly, sensuous
Hey guys, three words
Can't go wrong with crisp white shirt
Wear flannel in the forest
Plaid if you're a tourist
Tank top if you're swimming
And polyester if you don't like women
Sweatshirt when you're grunting
Thermals when you're hunting
Girls will treat you like Adonis
They even love on faux pajamas
Chris White shirt, styling tie, jacket slacks
Shoes that shine, starched black, mountain eyes
Cotton's hot, button up all night, you got long sleeves
French cuff, studded cutlet, sensuous
Hey guys, three words can't go wrong with
Chris White shirt, styling tie
Jacket slacks, shoes that shine
Studs light, modernized
Cotton's hot but the bonnets got long sleeves
French cup, studly, cuddly, sensuous
Hey guys, three words
Can't go wrong with crisp white shirt
