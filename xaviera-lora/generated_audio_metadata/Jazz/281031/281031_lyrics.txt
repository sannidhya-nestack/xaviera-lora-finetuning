So far away
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
But I won't let you in, let you in, let you in
So far away
So far away
You're the one that I want, you're the one that I need
I don't want to die, pass away
But I want to stay, stay away
Just for a while, stay away
I'll pass away, stay away, stay away
I don't want to die
I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it
(Tutututu, tututututu)
