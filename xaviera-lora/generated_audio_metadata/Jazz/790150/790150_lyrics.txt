What do you see in that chick
You got nothing in common
Well look at the shape that I'm in
I'm a bona fide woman
Well what do you see in that broad
She's a barfly floozy
Look at my lips so juicy
I'll show you what oh so few see
I'm the joy you need boy
Heed these words
I'm counting to three
It's her or me
And it better not be her
Oh honey, what do you see in that tramp?
You know she's an old gold digger
Just look at my heart, it's bigger
Whoa, let me pull your trigger
What do you see in Miss Thing?
She's a five and dimer
A word past her primer
A hoochie cootie timer
I'm a joy and need boy
Heed these words
I'm counting to three
It's her or me
And it better not be her
Who's it gonna be
Her or me
Well, who you gonna pick for your sweet tomato?
Who you gonna drop like a hot potato?
What you see in that girl?
She's about, wow, bless her
A Kmart dresser
A PMSer and a joy-a-nee boy
Heed these words
I'm counting to three
It's her or me
And it better not be her
Me, no me, no me, me, me, no I be, me, it's me
And it better, better
Not be heard
