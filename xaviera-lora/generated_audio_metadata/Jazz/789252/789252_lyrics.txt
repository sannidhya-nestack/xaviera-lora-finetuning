Too many margaritas that night in San Antonio
You left with Rosalita and never came back home (Never came back home)
So remember the alimony, send it on to me
Remember what the judge said, mismatch your history
You want your independence, it's gonna cost you to be free
So remember the alimony
You such a big wheeler, big dealer
Shootin' big shots of tequila, stealin' kisses
This is how we ended up in court
I rose pleaded, I been mistreated
I saw you cheatin' with a Rosalita
Judge said please be seated
I don't need to see no more
He said, "Remember the alimony, that is my decree
Or you will end up in the Texas Penitentiary
You want your independence, it's gonna cost you to be free
So remember the alimony
I was so good, loyal, cool, toil
Now I hope you strike oil
Boy, I'm gonna be your royal pain
And yo, you know where to find me now
Glad it's ended, it's mine, it's mine
And I'll defend it, write it, sign it, send it
That's my battle cry
Oh, remember the alimony you sent it home to me
Remember what the judge said, "Miss, I'm off your history"
You want your independence, it's gonna cost you to be free
So remember the alimony
Oh, remember the alimony, send it on to me
Remember what the judge said, miss a month your history
You want your independence, it's gonna cost you to be free
So remember the alimony
So remember the alimony
(high-pitched screeching)
