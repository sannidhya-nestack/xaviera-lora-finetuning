When you're by my side
And speaking softly
Words you only mean for me
Somewhere deep inside
I start to feel
All the things that love ought to be
And when you hold my hand and look at me with something special in your eyes
Then I understand love's mystery
And I know it tells no lies
Some say love is blind, it has no wisdom
Maybe that is often true
But there is a kind of love that sees
And that I give to you forever
When you hold me tight and love me
Just as if you'd never let me go
It's as if a light above me shines
Everything around starts to glow and
Every time we come together
And you touch me in the way
You do
I just know we'll last forever
I'll give all I've got to you
I'll give everything I've got
(howling)
