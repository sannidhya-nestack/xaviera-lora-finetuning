Looking for romance
Then you have to dance
When you start to sway
That is when we play
Music from the wine
Soon you will be mine
Now you dance so neat, clever with your feet
Anderness grows every time you dance by
And so who knows if I'll catch your eye
It could be we two have lucky fate
And I will be the one you choose tonight
Underneath the moon
Into a lovely tune
See how great you move
There's nothing left to prove
Reaching for new heights
Higher than the kite
This is our time
Our poem, our rhyme
Tenderness grows every time you dance by
And so who knows if I'll catch your eye
It could be we two had a lucky fate
And I will be the one you choose tonight
Tenderness grows every time you dance by
And so who knows if I'll catch your eye
It could be we two have lucky fate
And I will be the one you choose
Tonight
