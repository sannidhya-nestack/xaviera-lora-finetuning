I passed your window, I saw your eyes glow
You cast a glance that whispers
Romance
Something inside me knows
It's got to be you
It's got to be you
From my hat to my shoes
Yeah I got the news
Love's going to be true
Something inside me throws
To the mere idea of you
With a wink of your eye
You kissed my lonesome blues, bye-bye
It's you and me and the moon tonight
You drive me out of my mind
It's got to be you
Oh, it's got to be you
Hey it's got to be you
Well it's got to be you
We could be shooting the breeze
But you and me will make history
When your hand touches mine
It feels so divine
Now it's love in time
I've never felt such bliss
I've never felt a kiss like this
And after that kiss we'll say
You changed my winter into May
You put the ole in my café au lait
I've just gotta say hey hey hey
It's got to be you
Oh babe it's got to be you
Mmm, it's got to be you
Oh, it's got to be you, yeah
It's got to be you
Hey, take it boy
It's got to be you
Yeah, yeah, it's got to be you, it's got to be you
Be you, it's got to be you
It's got to be you, it's got to be you
