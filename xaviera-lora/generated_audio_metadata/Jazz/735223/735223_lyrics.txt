Since my baby's gone, nothing rhymes
The clock on the wall tells me it's late
And nothing matters anymore
Since the day you closed the book and the birds out blew
When I hear them sing as I wait by the phone
But it don't work now
I'm so sad without my baby
That nothing, nothing rhymes
Well, I start to cry when I hear your name
I only have myself to talk to
I'm as blue as I can be
I wonder why you set me up
Or just so you could do me wrong
Now my life's like an old moral haggard tune
'Cause I'm so sad without my baby
That nothing, well nothing rhymes
Well nothing rhymes but I'm gonna get better (she's gonna get better) nothing rhymes
I'm gonna sit right down and write a note
Saying I don't need you, I've got my dog
I'm a princess and you're a fool
And soon you'll miss me and you'll call
Maybe summer, maybe winter, maybe spring or autumn
Not a chance, you know,'cause I've got plans
I'll be dancing and romancing with your brand new man
Boy, what do you know?
Talk about timing
Well, I've got to go
everything's rhyming
I'm moving on
Those days are gone
When nothing, nothing rhymes
Well, why do you know?
Talk about your timing
She's gotta go
How it ain't'cause everything's a-rhymin'
She's moving on
Those days are gone
When nothing
Nothing
You know I mean nothing
She means nothing
Nothing rhymes, whoo
