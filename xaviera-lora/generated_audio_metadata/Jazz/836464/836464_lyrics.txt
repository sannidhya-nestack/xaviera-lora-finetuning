My baby's sensitive, he ain't afraid to cry
Sensitive, he can look me in the eye
And see exactly what I feel before it shows
My baby knows
He's vulnerable, yeah, he lets down his defense
So vulnerable, with him there's no suspense
He's an open book, his heart's upon his sleeve
And I do believe
That loving him is easy'cause he lets me know he needs me
That don't mean he's weak, that means he speaks in words
I understand at any given moment I'm a child or a woman
He lets me be and still loves me no matter who I am
He's sensitive, so sensitive, my baby's sensitive, so sensitive
Oh my baby, he's so
I've seen the gym
My baby's sensitive, he's such a tender touch
Sensitive, you know he's never in a rush
He takes his time to find what makes me tick, ooh
That's when we click, ooh
My baby's sensitive, don't mess with him, he's tough
My baby's sensitive
He knows what I love
Call it intuition, that's alright
But don't call tonight
Oh, my baby's sensitive
He's sensitive
My baby's sensitive
So sensitive
My baby's sensitive
He's so sensitive
Oh, my baby, he's so sensitive
My baby, my baby,'cause of him, he's so, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
