Sunny feelings, some are ringing in my heart
When I want to swim, I just close my eyes
You can tell me all you're loving anytime
Take me to the sea and hold me in your arms
I can see how it feels like to fly a blue sky
I can touch any cloud when I'm yours and you're mine
Sunny feelings, summer ringing in my heart
When I want to swim, I just close my eyes
You can tell me all you're loving anytime
Take me to the sea and hold me in your arms
I can see how it feels like
To fly a blue sky
I can touch any cloud
When I'm yours and you're mine
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
When I'm yours
