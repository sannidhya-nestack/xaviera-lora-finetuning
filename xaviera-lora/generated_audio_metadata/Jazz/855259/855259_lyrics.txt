It's a great day in Dixieland
Down on the coast they live a life of ease
Sailing off on the southern breeze
It's a great day in Dixieland
I got my line and my pole all set
Don't really care how many fish I get
It's a great day in Dixieland
Those sweet southern bells, they make my heart stand still
Always did and they always will
It's a great day in Big C Land
Down in Mobile they got a zillion azaleas
And over in G ia they're blowing those sweet vidayas
It's a great day in Big C Land
Now whether you travel by boat, coach or car
The Mississippi Delta is ready when you are
It's a break day in Pixieland
We got piano-picking chickens and other cockeyed attractions
Do-it-yourself peach pickings and more roadside distractions
It's a break day in Pixieland
If you've cried far and wide for fried green tomatoes
Just wait'til you've tried a side of fried sweet potatoes
It's a great day in Dixieland
Now if you've never had those grips that we're so famous for
Come on down and eat one, you'll surely want some more
It's a great day in Dixieland
Dixieland, my Disneyland
From Natchez Town to Birmingham
Each street down to Louisiana
So if you're ever in the neighborhood
You'll understand why it's understood
That it's a great day in Big City land
It's a great day in big city land
It's a great day in big city land
Some say New Orleans and some say New Orleans
But everyone agrees about the rice and red beans
It's a great day in big city land
The Beatles cut their teeth on the records we made
Rhythm and blues, peace and love, and a piece of blue suede
It's a great day in Dixieland
We still take hay rides and even hold hands
Sugar is alive and well all over these lands
It's a great day in Dixieland
I like this one
We had rednecks way back in ancient history
Seminole, Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee
It was a great day in Dixieland
Dixieland, my Disneyland
From Highway 31 to Highway 41
Highway 51 to Highway 61
And that's the intersection of country, soul, jazz and the blues
And about all that leaves is rock mom and all for I'm like him too
It's a great day in New Zealand
It's a great day in New Zealand
It's a great day in Dixieland
It's a great day in Dixieland
It's a great day in Dixieland
It's a great day in Dixieland
