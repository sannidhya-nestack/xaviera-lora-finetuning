I'd like to know just what you use
Oh, a strange kind of love mixed with the blues
I'd like to know, creeped in my heart
Came in the night, broke my heart
And gave me the blues
I dream a dream
It's about you
Of the sweet tenderness
Sweet but so blue
But I know you've gone, and you seem so near
You're just across town, about a million miles from here
Oh I know you're close and your heart's so near
But your eyes always say that you're not here
It breaks my heart, my heart and my soul
'Cause it's time to say goodbye
And I just can't let go
I'm not afraid to go this way
Heaven sent me a dream and took it away
It's time to go away from here
As far as I can, just about a million miles from here
It breaks my heart, my heart and my soul
it's time to say goodbye and I just can't let go
I'd like to know just what you use
Oh, a strange kind of love mixed with the blues
I'd like to know what creeped in my heart
Came in the night, broke my heart and gave me the blues
It breaks my heart, my heart and my soul
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
