I'm gonna be a bad boy, I'm gonna be a bad boy, I'm gonna be a bad boy, I'm gonna be a bad boy
I'd like to return, I'd like to return, I'd like to return, it all means world of music
(Outro)
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die
I'd like to return
I'd like to return
I'd like to return
It all means world of music
I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what's going on in my life.
I'd like to return, it all ain't well with me
