Oh maroon, check out that hatchet girl
Crackin' that chick with the twirlin' of pearls
Stackin' that rack with the gigglin' of wiggly world
I don't wear a hat, my hair's too slick, don't worry about that
I dig that chick, I'm in love with the hatchet girl
Hey baby, take my scarf with my umbrella too
I'll be back when the closing sparkles
I wanna be your failure
Baby, baby looking, soup soup cooking
You the black girl
I wanna be your cat, hat, check girl
Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo
Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo
Ooh, hat trick girl
Mm-mm, hat trick girl, you're making me nuts
You getting off early, wanna go bopping and hopping around the world?
And fling them hats that never got claimed
And swing like cats that never got tamed
What do you say, hat check girl?
Hey baby, nice cigar and blow some smoke so sweet
How full is fifty in your jar and myself at your feet?
You better be lookin'
Chim-chim cookin'
Keter in the big black curl
I wanna be your cat, hat check girl
Come on and dance with me
Ooh-ah
Let's blow this joint, come on
Ooh, hatchet girl
You better double up and ship ship cookin'
Get it with the big black curl
I wanna be attached
I wanna make a match
I'm a pretty good catch, hatchet girl
Beautiful
