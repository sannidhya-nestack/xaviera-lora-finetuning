Let's keep in touch, let's keep in touch, keep in touch with me
Drop me a line, any old time
You know that I'll be free on a Sunday or a holiday
I'll be available, my date book is never full
Since you sent me on my way
Let's keep in touch, let's keep in touch
Cause you might want me back
You never know how life can go
It's never white or black
And when you're spraying your heart running brown every night
Use me as your crutch
Come on baby, let's keep in touch
Around midnight I just know you might need some comforting
Come on and give me a ring
You know I'll treat you right
Let's keep in touch
We'll do lunch Dutch
So we can reminisce
'Bout the good old days and the loving ways
That you're gonna miss
And when you're spraying your heart running round every night
I'll be your big old crutch
Come on baby, let's keep in touch
Come on baby, let's keep in touch
