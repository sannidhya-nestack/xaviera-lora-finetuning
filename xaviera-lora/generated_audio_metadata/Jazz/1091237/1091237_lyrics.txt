One, two, a one, two, a one, two, three, four, five.
Had not got a point on this Saturday night
Had not got a point on this Saturday night
You look like old Buddy Brown
You go home and eat supper, lay right back down
Now don't I look like Lindbergh flying through the air
Don't I look like Lindbergh flying through the air
It's so precious to me
That pain and the strain of the course of frame
My girl went far away, she went up on a hill
My girl went far away, from Tulsa, Oklahoma City
She's far away, up on a hill, gonna send her a kiss by whipper
Well now hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
Hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
You look like old Buddy Brown to go home and eat your supper lay right back down
Now what you knowin' Joe, ain't no tellin' Ellen
Now what you knowin' Joe, ain't tellin' Ellen
Be out there thicker than blackbirds
Goin' like a flasher with the bug blowed out now
Hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
Hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
You look like old Buddy Brown
You go home and eat your supper lay right back down now Buddy
Now hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
Hadn't I got a point on this Saturday night
You look like old Buddy Brown
You go home and eat yourself a layer right back down
You go home and eat yourself a layer right back down
You go home and eat yourself a layer right back down
