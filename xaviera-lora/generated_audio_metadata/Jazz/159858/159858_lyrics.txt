Don't start talking poetry, darling
It's not what I want to hear tonight
I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes
I want a soda and a souvenir
Yes, I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes
And don't start singing that love song, darlin'
The words are dangerously clear tonight
And I'm a girl with moonlight in my eyes
I want a soda and a souvenir
Yes, I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes
Watch what you say, I'll remember it all day
Oh, it's so easy for me to fall
If you only knew, you might not say anything at all
So don't start singing that love song, darlin'
I believe every word that I hear tonight
I'm a girl with moonlight in my eyes
I want a soda and a souvenir
Yes, I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes
Oh yes, and I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes
