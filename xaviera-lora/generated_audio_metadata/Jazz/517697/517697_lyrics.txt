Don't you know that you're my little cutie
You're the one who makes me scream for sure
Spun gold hair and jade eyes, what a beauty
There's no one like you, ooh, you're so knocked out
Cutie, when you put your arms around me
You light the car, be your daddy G
My heart melts in your hands
Can't you understand that cutie you're the one for me
Oh I'm the one that you can always turn to
If you ever need a helping hand
Or if you ever need a second fiddle
Cutie don't you know that I'm your man
Cutie when you put your arms around me
You laugh and call me your daddy G
My heart melts in your hands
Can't you understand that Judy
You're the one for me
When you fold your arms and push your little lips into that pretty bow
Don't you know there's nothing that I can deny you
You'll always get your way with me no doubt
Cutie when you put your arms around me
You'll have to call me your daddy G
My heart melts in your hands
Can't you understand it cutie
You're the one for me
When you fold your arms and push your little lips into that pretty bow
Don't you know there's nothing that I can deny you
You'll always get your way with me no doubt
Oh cutie when you put your arms around me
You laugh and call me old daddy G
My heart melts in your hands
Can't you understand that cutie you're the one for me
I don't mean maybe cutie you're the one for me
Yeah you my baby cutie you're the one for me
Oh my cutie don't you know that you're the one for me
