What's it to you? You seem surprised
To find me here out with some guy
You said we were through
Baby what's it to you? What's it to you?
Why so concerned, isn't that rare
Right up'til now you didn't care
Some people do, baby what's it to you
You said the world was calling
And tossed me over the side
What did you care that I was falling?
What did you know of how hard I cried?
Look at you now, cold and alone
And you're asking me to come running home
Well, I've got things to do
Tell me what's it to you?
You said the world was calling
And tossed me over the side
What did you care that I was falling?
What did you know of how hard I cried?
Look at you now, cold and alone
And you're asking me to come running home
Well I've got things to do
Tell me what's it to you
