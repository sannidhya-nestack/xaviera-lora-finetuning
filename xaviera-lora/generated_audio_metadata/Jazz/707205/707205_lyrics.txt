Man you drank the last, the last case from the bottle
You ain't, you ain't nothing man, you just like Johnny

Man, you drank the last, the last taste of the bottle, you ain't, you ain't nothin', man, you just like Johnny! (17 cents, only 40 of them 17 cents)
Yeah, that's good (Give it to me, man, give it to me)
