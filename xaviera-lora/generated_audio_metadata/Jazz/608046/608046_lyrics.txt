I think I know just what you want to say to me
The writing's on the wall
The stupid ride you're on is running over me
I cannot take this call
Oh, oh, oh, not at all
I've waited such a long time and should have been
But I've waited nonetheless
What's left is not enough to get me back again
What's left is just a mess
I'm sitting on top of what is killing me
And I'm giving this goodbye
And I'm telling you I don't want you telling me
I've lost my eyes
