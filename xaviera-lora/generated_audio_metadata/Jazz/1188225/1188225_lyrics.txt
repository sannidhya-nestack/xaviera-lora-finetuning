Here comes the time to realize
About this crazy world around you
I'll bring you down
To save our souls
And set them free before it's all
Hear me right now
We're not alone
Stop making up your mind
With your back against the wall
Shower this unity with hope and love
Can't you see how we are bound together?
Be together
We're going blind
Victims of lies
While the hurt is blowing over
Fully aware
The world won't get no better
If we all just let it be
Hear me right now, we're not alone
Stop making up your mind with your back against the wall
Shower this unity with hope and love
Can't you see how we are bound together?
Be together
Hear me right now, we're not alone
Stop making up your mind, we're back against the wall
Showered this unity with hope and love
Can't you see how we're bound together?
Be together, for a brand new dawn
Be together, can't you see how we're bound?
Can't you see how we're bound?
Be together, then how?
Be together, oh oh
