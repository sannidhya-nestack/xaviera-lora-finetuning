A smoky room, a cocktail glass, a table near the stage
A Gershwin or an Arlen tune when we were all the rage
I listened while you played all through the night in some cafe
And in the dawn I felt the tender sound of yesterday
The drummer brushed so quietly
The bass was soft and low
While fingers fell onto the keys
Like raindrops melting snow
Each melancholy note from your guitar had much to say
And in your kiss I taste the tearful sound of yesterday
Why did you leave those taunting words
To linger in my heart
That said, "You never loved me from the start"
And even though
You knew just how to make me say goodbye
Your melody remembers that our love was not a lie
My cocktail glass is empty now
No sparkling pink champagne
Your music haunts my memory
A bittersweet refrain in after hours of after times
I find a way to live in dreams so deeply near the sound of yesterday
In after hours of after times
I find a way to live in dreams
So near the sound of yesterday
Wonderful music
Dangerous rhythm
Oh, the sound of yesterday
