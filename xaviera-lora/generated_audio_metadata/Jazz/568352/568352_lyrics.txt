Those bumpy skies and black clouds
They just drag me down
Your kisses so deep they make me feel weak
Yes, there's been trouble with you since we began
Troubled waters and deep quick sand
That light in your eyes it won't let me hide
Darling, I don't care anymore
Let's go on this crazy ride
It's too real to feel to just fly away
Give me more and more, let's do it all again
Darling, don't let it end
There's been trouble with you since we took off
Those bumpy skies and black clouds, they just drag me down
Your kisses so deep they make me feel weak
Darling, I'm telling you I don't care anymore
It's just too real to turn and walk away
Baby, give me more and more, let's do it all again
Don't let it end
