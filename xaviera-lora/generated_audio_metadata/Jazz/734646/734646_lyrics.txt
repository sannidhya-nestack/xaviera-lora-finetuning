Mellow deep and sweet harmonies
A love to grace the land
Blue to red seek the colors set
In the morning sun
Hurricane blow insane
To big cape pocket of my love
But as it grows her teacher knows
Silver is not good as gold
Don't you know my love, honeyfield
And bubble wheels
Strangers never lies
Outside my door
You call me once more
To pick a bucket of my love
Don't you know my love
Love is sweet, but strange, surprise
And deserves a winner's prize
Rise down and shine like a knight
Surrounded by the promise
Surrounded by the promise
That big safe pocket of my love
That big safe pocket of my love
Yes it beats a bucket of my love
Yes it beats a bucket of my love
