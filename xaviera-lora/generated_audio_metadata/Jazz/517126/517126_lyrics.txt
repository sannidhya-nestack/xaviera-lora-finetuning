Deep in my mind and I see you clearly on the other side
But distant dreams still haunt me over here
Memories fade but yet I hear your voice it sounds so clear
You whisper words that my heart longs to hear
I think of you night and day
I dream of you every night
I'll never et the life of moments I've spent with you
I can't remember one more moment I've spent with you
I know that I'll make it through'til I am again with you
Softly I gaze and know that you are always by my side
The world between us gone when I close my eyes
Lovely and mystic a man that's also very very clear
We whisper gently sharing our secrets here
I think of you night and day
I dream of you every night
I'll never et the life of moments I spent with you
If I could remember one more moment I spent with you
I know that I'll make it through
Till I am again with you
Till I am again with you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah
