Take my hand, hold me tight
Don't let go'til the morning light
Here we are, back in love
Standing here, eye to eye
My heart skips a beat when our eyes meet
Feel the heat, our love is bittersweet
Take the bad, take the good
In your arms is where I long to be
Oh, knock on wood, so far so good
Tart and sweet, our love is bittersweet
Walk with me, talk to me
Can't believe you're in love with me
In your eyes I can see
What your heart's trying to say to me
My heart skips a beat when our eyes meet
Feel the heat, our love is bittersweet
Take the bad, take the good
In your heart is where I long to be
Knock on wood, so far so good
Tart and sweet, our love is bittersweet
Oh, knock on wood, so far so good
Tart and sweet, our love is bittersweet
And our love, our love's bittersweet
