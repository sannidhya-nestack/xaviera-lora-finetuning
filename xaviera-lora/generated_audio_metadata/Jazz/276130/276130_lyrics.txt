The higher that we rise
The bigger the picture that comes into view
The further that we climb
The closer we get to touching the moon
And in this hardest state
Choose what you'd like to create
The higher that we rise
The closer we get
To the divine
Animal
But spirit as one
Do you choose to crawl when you can soar above it all?
What from your heart?
What keeps it all apart?
From one love, one purpose
To be all that you are
The higher that we rise
The bigger the picture that comes into view
The further that we climb
The closer we get
To touching the moon
And in this hardest day
Choose what you'd like to create
The higher that we rise
The closer we get
To the divine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not from your heart
What did you say when I'm gone?
Wonderful to be on the top
The higher that we rise
The bigger the picture that comes into view
The further that we fly
The closer we get
To touching the moon
And in this hidden stage
Truth that you've looked at me
The higher that we rise
The closer we get
To the divine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
