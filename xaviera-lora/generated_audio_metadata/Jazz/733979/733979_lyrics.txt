Martini time, martini time
Time to unwind, dry and sublime
Sorry cock that wine
And put away that ride, my mind
Would I be uncouth if I tell the truth?
Leave out that vermouth when you visit my booth
Don't kill it with ice
Oh just chill it, that's nice
My, my, it's martini time
I'm lighting up my straws
Martini time
Don't want to break no laws
Martini time
I ain't no beginner
Martini time
Olives for dinner
For a twist, lemon rind
Or a Gibson is fine
An onion defines
That very fine line
I tread my cockies
For one more if you please
But keep
It's martini time
I'm lining up my straws
Martini time
Don't wanna break no laws
Martini time
I ain't no beginner
Martini time
I'll have sparkling now
Martini time
Martini time
Martini time
Martini time
Oh it's high time for that dry martini
Martini time
Martini time
Martini time
Oh
