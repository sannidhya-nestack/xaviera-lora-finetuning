I'm feeling a little weird right now, my fingers are starting to itch, my skin's starting
to crawl
My shoulders are rollin' from side to side
My legs beginnin' to twitch
I need a fix, I'm havin' hip withdrawal
I'm Jones to swing tonight, swing tonight
I got hot lick chills and a little bit of Chittybug shakes
I'm Jones to swing tonight, swing tonight
Pick me up and carry me away
I Jones for coffee, green Dutch beers, and I Jones for Marlboro lights
I Jones for G e, Ringo, John and Paul
I Jones for baseball in the Bronx on crisp October nights
But the one thing that I Jones for most of all
I wanna swing!
I'm Jones to swing tonight
Swing tonight
I got hot leg chills and a little bit of jitterbug shanks
I'm Jones to swing tonight
Swing tonight
Pick me up and carry me away
I'm Jones to swing tonight
Swing tonight
I got hot lick chills and little bit jitterbug shakes
I'm Jones to swing tonight
Swing tonight
Pick me up and carry me
Pick me up and carry me
Pick me up and carry me away
