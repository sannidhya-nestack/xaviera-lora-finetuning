Jazz is a call deep inside, like a voice in your mind
Jazz is a hushed lullaby, a taste of days gone by
Jazz is a journey on high, feel the wind in your wings
Fly like a dove in the sky, let jazz be your guide
Jazz is a song in my heart, an old fashioned melody
Jazz is a phrase from the past, an echo on my mind
Jazz is a tune in my soul that I hope not I'll know
Feels like a shadow inside, a blue scar in my heart
Fly like a dove
Up to the skies above
Doo doo
There's a secret in my heart
The melody of love
Jazz
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Jeff
Tell me all about Jeff
Fly, lie, or die
Up to the skies, or ball
Do, do, there's a riddle in my heart
The melody of love
Just
I don't like cats
Do do do do do do do
I like jazz
Jazz is a song in my heart
A song in my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Jazz is a call to even sign
Like a voice in your mind
Jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz
That's a phrase from the past
Echo on my mind
I like, I like jazz
