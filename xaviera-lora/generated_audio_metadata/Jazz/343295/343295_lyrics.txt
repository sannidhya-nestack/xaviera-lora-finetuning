You can try but you can't control me
And you can try but you just can't mold me
Well you can try all night
You can try but you can't control me
Well you can try it won't work
But you can try no you can't control me
No earpiece to tell me how to sound
No gas pedal to rev me up or slow me down
No queer eye to tell me what to wear
No voodoo doll to help me style my hair
You can try, it won't work
Yeah you can try but you can't control me
No oh no oh oh yeah
Ain't no wine that'll calm me down
You can't light my fires with that sexy nightie gown
No puppet strings to pull me back and forth
No steering wheel to keep me driving north
You can try, it won't work
But you can try, but you can't control me, no
You can try, but you can't control me
You can try, but you just can't mold me
Well, you can try all night
You can try, but you can't control me
You can try, it won't work
But you can try, and you can't control me
Try, try, try (try)
Try, try, try (try)
Try, try, try (try)
Try, try, try
But you can't try
It won't work
But you can try
No you can't control me
