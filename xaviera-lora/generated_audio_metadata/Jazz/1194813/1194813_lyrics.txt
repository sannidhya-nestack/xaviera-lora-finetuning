I knew I'd meet you long before I met you
I waited patiently for you
And I knew I'd love you long before I loved you
Don't ask me how I knew
I knew we'd be together
It was written in the stars
And I knew we would find each other
You have always been in my heart
I knew you'd love me
Long before you met me
I knew I'd be good for you
And I knew where we were going
Long before we went there
I knew that we'd say "I do"
I knew we'd be together
It was written in the stars
And I knew we would find each other
You have always been in my heart
I knew I'd lose you
Long before you did
And I know I'll find you again
Our destiny's not through
I know we'll be together again
It is written in the stars
And I know we will find each other
You have always been
You will always be
