Try to visualize the place, no light
All them people's voices sound the same
It's so strange, darkness, it's so cold
Just follow the trail, keep looking
And your way
Don't you want to know it
What they say is all true
Though there's much more out there waiting just for you
Listen to the sounds around you
Let them take you home
If you drop all your defenses
Find a love you've never found
Just let yourself go
Let the rhythm take your soul
Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Listen to the sounds around you
You want to know it what they say is all truth
You know there's much more out there waiting just for you
