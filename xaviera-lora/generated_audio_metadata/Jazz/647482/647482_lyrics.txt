Suspended here above the clouds
Six miles when I'm looking down
I'm rising up, I'm lifted, I am lighter
You take me there
Leave the earth behind until tomorrow
Stay here drifting
I'm not coming down
I'm flying
The storm clouds bring
All of this rain
To stay above the clouds
Gravity wants to hold me back down to earth
I want to stay here floating free
I'm flying on this wave
