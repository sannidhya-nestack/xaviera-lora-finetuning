I see you watching me
Across the stars, true and false
Past couples dancing to my score
Oh, look into each other's eyes
Left alone, the moonlit skies
Just blow in some time before moving on
And then suddenly
Our desire is a bottomless well
We fall into a spell
I walk among the thorns
Singing my sorrow song
Closing the space between us
Trying really hard to keep moving on
Na na na na, ooh, ay, uh
(Oh)
But in my mind
We're already engaged
The bed's unmade
And the breakfast's made
But you better have
Into your arms she hops
Even as my heart stops
There's nothing left to do
Move it on
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
I see you watching me
I see you watching me
Na na na na na na na na na na move it on
'Cause I'm moving on, I'm moving on, I'm moving on, moving on
