Song, where will you take me?
Song, spare me or break me
Here we go again
God, help me ignore these
Eyes swelling before me
Steer me to the end
For a song, what I'd do
For a song, right or wrong
What I'd choose
For a song, I'll till gain
I'll till lose
All in the name of rhyme, rhythm and blues for a song
What I'd do for a song
My choices have made me
My voices persuade me
I'm where I belong
For a song, what I give, for a song
Short or long, I will live for a song
Let it play, let it sing
Push my buttons and pull my string
For a song, what I'd do for a song
Right or wrong, what I choose
For a song
All to gain, all to lose
All in the name of rhyme, rhythm and blues
For a song, what I'd do
For a song, for you
For a song, what I'd do
For a song
Okay
I don't think, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think
I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool, I think I'm a fool
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang, bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang, bada boom, bada boom
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang, bada boom
Bada bang, bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang, bang boom
Bada bang, bada boom, bada bang
Oh, every time we stand and every time we roll in the hole they will love us
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, bada bang
Bada boom, boom bang
Bada boom, bada bang
