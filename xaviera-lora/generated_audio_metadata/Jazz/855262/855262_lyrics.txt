My heart beats for you
Baby it does for you
Maybe it was for you
I was made, I was made for you
My heart beats for you
Maybe you know it's true
Baby I'll show
To you, all my love
All my love for you
One look was all it took
I knew I'd fall for your hook
You're the living end in my book
My heart beats for you
Nobody else will do
My body melts with you
I'm in love and all my love's for you
