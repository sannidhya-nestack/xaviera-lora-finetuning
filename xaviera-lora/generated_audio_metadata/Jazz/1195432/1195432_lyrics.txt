Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Knew you were right at the moment of sight
Then your heart gave a kiss to mine
That let me know the truth would endure
And this broken heart
Now has it secured?
You're not hard to please
Keep my mind at ease
You keep me afloat
When my fears try to drown me
That lesson, though, the truth will endure
And this broken heart now has it cured?
(You are so weak)
You are easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love, you are so easy to love
Yes, you are, so easy to love, to love, yeah
Bleeding to my eye, it's written in the sky
That two hearts will never die
That lets me know
Feelings are secure and easy love is always pure
You will keep me where angels run free
And my soul repeats to me you should know
Feelings are secure
Easy love is always pure
You are so easy, you are so easy
So easy to love (you are so easy to love)
You are exact (you are so easy)
You are so easy to love
You are so easy to love (so easy to love)
