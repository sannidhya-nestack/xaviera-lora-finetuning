I woke up last night
I was like a cat in heat
I would've clawed through the sliding glass door
To get to that man
I was howlin' for him big time
It was the call of the wild
But he's not even my boyfriend
He's got that animal magnetism
And I'm drawn to him
The more I struggle with those sensations
The further I know I'm gonna fall
But I was howling for him big time
It was the call of the wild
But he's not even my boyfriend
Did I just say that out loud?
Well, no one listens to the lyrics anyway
Oh, God have mercy on my soul
God have mercy on my soul
I'm a little iron butterfly
He's the magnetic north of masculinity
I wanna run to the jungle and make hot sweaty monkey love
Well, I was howlin' for him big time
It was the call of the wild
Plus, he smells good
Did I just say that out loud?
Well, no one listens to the lyrics anyway
Well, God have mercy on my soul
God have mercy on my soul
