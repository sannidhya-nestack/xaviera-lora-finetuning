Next to you, the moon's just a colored ball
The finest wine's merely alcohol
Niagara's just another waterfall
Next to you
Next to you, my heart's on fire again
The world looks brighter than it's ever been
Since I discovered that rainbows end next to you, next to you
For as much as I tried I was dying inside for someone who really cared
My broken hearted healing started
When I pulled up a chair next to you
The redwood's just another tree
Stardust is just another melody
Rest assured that I will always be
Next to you, next to you
For as much as I tried I was dying inside
For someone who really cared
My broken hearted healing started
When I pulled up that chair
Next to you all my lonely nights are memories
Feels just like coming home to me
There's no question I was born to be
Next to you, next to you
