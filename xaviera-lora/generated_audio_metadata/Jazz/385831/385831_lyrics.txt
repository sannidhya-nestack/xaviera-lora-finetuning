It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer ceases reapin'
In the meadow cows are sleepin'
And the speckled trout stop leapin' upstream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill Unfolding like a rose
If you'll hold my hand and sit real still You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a lazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet
Except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by us to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon
Noon with me
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you'll hold my hand and sit real still
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a lazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet
Except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by us to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon
With me, with me, with me
