A funky Russian hat, her ten gallon eyes
She fools you with her loving and her lies
I dig her frenemies, they come and go in spurts
I love the way she loves me but I hate the way she flirts
You can't tell me she doesn't know
She makes the rules up as she goes
Never answers her telephone
Nobody home
Buying drinks with a smile
Returning presents for cash
If you don't want a nobody
You ain't got to ask
Fine Italian boots
Just below her skirt
I love the way she loves me but I hate the way she flirts
You can't tell me she doesn't know
She makes the rules up as she goes
Never answers her telephone
Nobody home
She's cocky like a cat, like a dog I come
If I'm a good boy you know she might just give me some
I dig her frenemies, they really dish the dirt
I love the way she loves me but I hate the way she flirts
You can't tell me she's out of touch
Just enough is a little too much
Never answers her telephone
Nobody home, nobody home, nobody home
