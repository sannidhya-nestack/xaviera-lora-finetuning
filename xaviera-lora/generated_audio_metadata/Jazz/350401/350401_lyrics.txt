Fashions are for the young
Sometimes I think my time is done
You have to be skinny to fit in a bikini
And I don't like many skirts and bright shirts
Fashions are for the young
Sometimes I feel we must succumb
All my life staying slim to be sure I'm always trim
Now why can't I indulge and bulge?
Wrinkles aren't as bad as they say in all the ads
Why must grey be washed away?
Fashions are for the young
Let's call a moratorium
I haven't changed inside, I'm still as much alive
So let's make age the new rage with fashions
For our age, fashions
For our age, a rounder form, a wrinkled face
Thinning hair with grey in place can be in style
Or set the style if designers would agree
To fashions for our age
Let's make age the new rage
Fashions for our age
