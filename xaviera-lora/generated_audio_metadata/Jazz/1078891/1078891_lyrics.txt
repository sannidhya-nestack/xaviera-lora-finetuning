Some place in the middle of a prologue and the end
Putting my slant on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
The motion of a life well me a freeze frame I suspend
Wondering who I've epilogued
In past tense
Couldn't be I missed the point
Yeah the memo it's intent
Pretty sure there's more to this than
Just paying rent
Looking for that bird land
I wanna hear that lullaby
Look upon an open sky
I wanna see them fly
Putting my sled on it here and I'm
Slipping Freud again
Putting my sled on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Me I choose not to be boxed yeah I choose to celebrate
Multi-faceted multi-colored no black no white no grey
And if culturally we're different
Then deep down we're just the same
This world is big enough
To give each their own space
Putting my sled on it here
And I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my sled on it here
And I'm slipping Freud again
Hush now not a word, not a word, not a word
Hush now not a word, not a word not a word
And if wealth breeds inequality
And fuels lack widening care
Then why is it our measurement
For happiness and health
I bid to end this human race, well, was it such a craze
Let's just lose the labels here and sing God in my name
Surely being part of something, well that shouldn't be our aim
It's our responsibility to reflect and to change
Putting my sled on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my sled on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my sled on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my sled on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my slant on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my slant on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my slant on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
Putting my slant on it here and I'm slipping Freud again
