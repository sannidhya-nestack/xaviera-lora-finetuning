I don't know about you my friend
But I'm heading down to the south
And gonna rise up with the morning dew
I'm in to mark for someone new
I'm going fishing, going fishing, going fishing
And I'm wishing that I find a new baby on the riverside today
Oh I know you can't sympathize
But we all need to socialize
That's why I'm throwing out my bait
Gotta catch'em before it's way too late
I'm gone fishing, gone fishing, gone fishing
And I'm wishing that I find a new baby on the riverside today
What do you do when you're tired of the same old thing?
Tired of finding someone who's fresh and exciting?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh, let me go while I'm still young
The scoping season has just begun
I'm tired of being a submarine
I'm just not ready to wait on time
I don't care about you, my pretty
I'm heading down to Atlantic City
There's plenty of fish in that big sea
Gotta be one that's right for me
Gonna fish it in, fish it in, fish it in
And I'm wishing
Gonna find a new baby by the riverside
Find a new baby by the riverside
Find a new baby by the riverside tonight
