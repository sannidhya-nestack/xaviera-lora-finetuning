Under the paintball light
Away from the prying eyes
We found a special place
Down by the paint cafe
Moving in shadows
On the street it's a secret affair
Making our way home
Going down to Italian Square
Under a moonlit sky
Everything comes to life
Lost in the atmosphere
Easy to disappear
Moving in shadows
On the street is a sacred affair
Making our way home
Going down to Italia Square
Going down
Moving in shadows on the street is a secret affair
Making our way home, going down to Italia Square
Moving in shadows as we breathe in the cool night air
We're making our way home
Going down to Italia Square
Going down to Italia Square
Going down to Italia Square
A secret rendezvous
A place for me and you
