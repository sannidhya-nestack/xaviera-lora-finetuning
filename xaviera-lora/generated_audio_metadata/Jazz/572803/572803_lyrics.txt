The old neighborhood is getting smaller every day
I was just a chip shot, just a stone's throw away
Now there's a few things I guess I could say
But I just stop by to say hello
I'm sorry to call my calling so late
But I saw the lamp in your window
Hey, I'm not trying to stir up no trouble
I just stopped by to say hello
How's your weather been?
It's been stormy on my side of town
Supposed to clear up when
That lucky old sun come back around
I guess I could tell you that I still love you
Guess I could tell you that I miss you so
Probably wouldn't though
Cause we're just a sitting here talking
Cause I just stopped by to say hello
How's your mother been?
I know she don't think too much of me
And how about your new boyfriend
Is he good company?
So we're just chit chatting bout how I still love you
Just a shooting the breeze bout how I miss you so
Just making small talk baby as we're sitting here talking
Cause I just stopped by to say hello
I just stopped by to say hello
Now down the road I'll go
