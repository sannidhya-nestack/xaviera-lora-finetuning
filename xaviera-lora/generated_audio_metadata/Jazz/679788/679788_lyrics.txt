I don't know sometimes where I went wrong
Maybe I tried too hard
Or I just wasn't strong enough
Sometimes the road you take
Only looks like somewhere you belong
But now that you speak my name
I recognize a heart
So close to my own
And I know I've come home
I've come home
So many years I've spent
Giving myself away
Hoping the time would come
Hoping I'd see the day
When a voice I knew would answer
Sometimes you make the best
Of whatever comes your way
And now that you touch my hand
Now that I recognize
A promise I can't hold
Oh, I know I've come home
I've come home
I've come home
I know I've made the best of whatever's come my way
And now that you speak my name
I recognize a heart so close to my own
And now that you touch my hand
Now that I recognize
A promise I can't own
I can feel
There's a place I can call home
I know I've come home
I've come home
I've found my way back home
I've come home
Hey, oh, I've come home
I've come home
