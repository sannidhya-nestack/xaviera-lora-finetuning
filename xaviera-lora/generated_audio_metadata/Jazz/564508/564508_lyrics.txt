Deja Blue, it's me again
Just like it happened here before
I trust my heart, things fall apart
And I'm right back at your door
Deja Blue
There's nothing new
Just the who, the where and when
It's all the same
And who's to blame
Deja Blue comes back again
You'd think that I'd learn not to answer
Each time love comes to call
But I just keep getting entangled
As fate sets me up for the fall
Deja Blue, I beg of you
Don't let me repeat the past
I hope someday that I can say
I'm through with Deja Blue at last
You'd think that I'd learn not to answer
Each time that love comes to call
But I just keep getting entangled
As fate sets me up
For the four days of blue
I beg of you
Don't let me repeat the past
I hope someday that I can say
I'm through with Deja Blue at last, at last, at last
