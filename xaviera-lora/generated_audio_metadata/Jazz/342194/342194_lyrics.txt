Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
(Yes, sir)
A man barely alive
(A man)
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
A man barely alive
A man barely alive
We can rebuild him
We have the technology
We can make him better than he was
Better
Stronger
Faster
Bigger, bigger, bigger
It's only right
See it
