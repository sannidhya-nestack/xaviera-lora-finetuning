Good evening.
Go from the beginning to the start.
Game on in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
And liftoff!
Final liftoff!
Last!
Shoulders of the space shuttle.
The Americans will continue the dream.
(Roger roll, Atlanta)
Be-da-ba-ba-de-da-da-da-de-de-do (Go for main engine start)
I'm not going to let you go, I'm not going to let you go, I won't let you go, I won't let you go
Fa la vi vera, fa per di
Ti la vi vera, fa per di
Fa la vi vera, fa per di
