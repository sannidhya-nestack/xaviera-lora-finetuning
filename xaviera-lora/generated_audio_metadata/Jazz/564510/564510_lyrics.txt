I'm gonna go down swinging
There'll be a tale to tell
Like a boxer in the ring
I'll give my everything
Until I hear that final bell
Well, I'm gonna go down swinging
Whether I'm right or wrong
I know without a doubt
Until the lights go out
You're gonna hear me singing this song
When you hear that melody, you'll still remember me
That's how this girl is gonna carry on
And when you hear that melody, you'll still remember me
That's how this girl is gonna carry on
