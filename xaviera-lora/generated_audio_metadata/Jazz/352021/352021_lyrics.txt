Come on baby
Come on with me
Come with me
And we're floating on
The calming seas, yeah
We're floating on the calming seas, baby you and me
We're together, nobody's around, being natural here
Feeling you, you're feeling me, motion of the ocean
Feeling good and feeling fine, you awake my emotion
You awake, you awake my emotion baby yes you do
There is nobody like you when we together baby
There is nobody like you when we together baby
You and me on the calming sea
Oh baby this is so nice

You and me feeling free on the sea being calm
Relaxing yeah
Mar de las calmas
