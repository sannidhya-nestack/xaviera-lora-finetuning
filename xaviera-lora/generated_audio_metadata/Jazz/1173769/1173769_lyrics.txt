He thinks he's God's gift to women
Gourmet meal with all the trimmings
A flawless diamond, no imperfections
Attracted to his own reflection
A slow walking sweet talker with his arms
No doubt he's the one your mama warned you about
He's the one
Lady's vanity is suits him well
His head over high heels in love with himself
A fairy tale nightmare man of your dreams
A knight on a black horse reality
If you're hoping for a happy ending
Better watch out
He's the one your mama warned you about
He's the one
He'll promise you the moon but it's a burned out star
Mama's good advice will save a broken heart
If he says north that's the time to start running south
He's the one your mama warned you about
He's the one
He'll promise you the moon, but it's a burned out star
Mama's good advice will save a broken heart
If he's at north, that's the time to start running south
He's the one your mama warned you about
So if you're hoping for a happy ending
Better watch out
He's the one your mama warned you about
He's the one
He's the one
