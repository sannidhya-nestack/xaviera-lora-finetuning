Tonight
My love for you will die
Tonight
With the moon up high
The hope my heart was clinging to
Is worth no more, no more than you
Tonight, I can't find a friend
Tonight, the streets will never end
Our strangers' hands
Will surely please
And soothe away the hurt, the memories
Tonight I'll give all my heart
So anyone can take it and tear it apart
Tonight all my faith is gone
Tonight feelings I have none
You were my spring, my autumn rain
You were my smile, my sorrow and my pain
Tonight I'll give all my heart
So anyone can take it and tear it apart
So anyone can take it and tear it apart
Tear it apart, apart
