Where is my baby? It's a quarter to nine
Waited all evening, wasting my time
Oh, I'm gonna get him back, Lord, I'm gonna try
But I'm just no good at being bad
I'm so mad at myself'cause I can't stay mad
I drop to my knees and hold out my hands
Prayin', "Lord, won't you help me to be bad?"
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
He's a sorry son of a gun, but I'm still his little ass
And I'll stay by his side, no matter what he do
And now it's a quarter'til two
And I'm just no good at being bad
When he walks through the door I et what I'd planned
I know I should leave him but here I am
And I'm just no good at being bad
I hear him talking
Don't care what he says
I say put away your excuses boy and
Come on back to bed
I don't need your stories so
Love me instead
Cause he's just so good
At being bad
He gives me good loving
The best that I've had
Someday I might leave him
But right now I need him
I'm just no good at being bad
