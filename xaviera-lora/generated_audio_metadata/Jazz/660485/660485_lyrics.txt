Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lover let me be and stay away from me
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lover let me be and stay away from me
I'm ready for something bigger you know what I mean
And if you don't just go and figure I'm out of the sea
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lover I don't need, easy love is not for me
Easy lover let me be and stay away from me
I'm ready for something bigger
You don't wanna be
And if you don't just go and figure
I'm leaving the scene
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lover let me be
And stay away from me
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lovers let me be
And stay away from me
I'm ready for shipping
You know when I'm in
And if you don't just go and be
I'll do the same
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
Easy lover I don't need
Easy love is not for me
