My type, my type
So many faces you imply
When I pull you tight
I look just like the scholar type
When I loosen up my collar
You lay back like happy hour
Yielded for the close encounter
The bearer you empower
I feel your power, oh
My type, my type
You make me feel so good inside
Warm me up like apple pie
While showcasing my cooler side
In my youth you made me feel like just another number
But soon I had my choice and I discovered
A power like no other
Oh
Cotton, silk or semi-dry
Ascot, bold or oversized
Long and skinny, short and wide
So many different kinds
One for every type
My tie, my tie
The star of my disguise
I'd be a fool to deny
Success to you defy
I hear a body cry, that I'll never say goodbye
Oh my tie, my tie, I bid never untie
My tie, oh
Da do da, da da, da da da da, da da, da da da
Ba do da, da da, da da, da da da
Ba do da, da da, da da da, ba da, ba ba
