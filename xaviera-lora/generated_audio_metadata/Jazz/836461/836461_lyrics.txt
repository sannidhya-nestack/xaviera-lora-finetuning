Like mom and dad under that old apple tree
I said I loved you and you said you loved me
But to name this relationship seems quite the task
So here's what I'll say if somebody should ask
We're an item, a pair of matcha two by two for one
A daily double dip in unison
Like a ping and a pong, king and a con
We get along like a ding and a dong
Significant other, never want another
We belong like a singer in song, we're an item
Partners in cahoots in every way
A duo who knows love is here to stay
Like seeing a shore, key in a door
Right to the core like we're the end of yore
But never say never, forever and ever
Behind each other like a three and a four, an item
A sweet old fashioned couple doubled up in passion
Lashes battened, flashing stars
Turn the clock wheels burning hot, an item
That's what we are
Kickin' a champ, lickin' a stamp
Kickin' the pants like a dip in a dance
Girlfriend, boyfriend, pride and joy friend
Slice and dicing, it's romance and item
Sweet old fashioned couple doubled up in fashion
Lashes batting, flashing stars
Turn the cock wheels burning hot and item
That's what we are (what we are) and item
That's what we are
