If you ask my favorite color, I have to say it's blue
It's the color of the sunny skies, and you know that's true
It's the color of my blue jeans, it's my favorite like I said
But when I see you with another man, girl, all I see is red
Yeah, blue's my favorite color, it's my favorite music too
That ain't nothing like a vintage strap
Pickin' out them blues
It makes me feel so mellow and keeps my soul well fed
But now you're with another man girl all I see is red
So I got to tell you baby
That I would rather see you dead
Than to see you with that other man
Cause all I see is red
You know since you left me baby
I've been feeling kinda blue
What was my favorite color
Is now my constant mood
So I gots to tell ya baby
I would rather see you dead
Than to see you with that other man
Cause all I see is red
So I gots to tell you baby, I am color blind
I don't see blue, I don't see green
I don't see yellow, I don't see nothing but red
