Long hair preachers come out every night
Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right
But when asked how about something to eat
They will answer with voices so sweet
You will eat by and by
In that glorious land above the sky
Work and pray
Live on hay
You'll get pie in the sky when you die
And the starvation army they play
And they sing and they clap and they pray
Till they get all your coin on the drum
Then they'll tell you when you're on the bum
Holy rollers and jumpers come out
And they holler, they jump, and they shout
Give your money to Jesus, they say
He will cure all diseases today
If you fight hard for children and wife
Try to get something good in this life
You're a sinner and bad man, they tell
When you die you will sure go to hell
Working men of all countries unite
Side by side we for freedom will fight
When the world and its wealth we have gained
To the grafters we'll sing this refrain
You will eat by and by
When you've learned how to cook and to fry
Chop some wood, it will do you good
And you'll eat in the sweet by and by
And the starvation army they play
And they sing and they clap and they pray
they get all your coin on the drum
Then they'll tell you when you're on the bum
Holy rollers and jumpers come out
And they holler, they jump and they shout
Give your money to Jesus they say
He will cure all diseases today
If you fight hard for children and wife
Try to get something good in this life
Your sinner and bad man they tell
When you die you will sure go to hell
Working men of all countries unite
Side by side we for freedom will fight
When the world and its wealth we have gained
To the grafters we'll sing this refrain
You will eat by and by
When you've learned how to cook and to fry
Chop some wood, we'll do you good
And you'll eat in the sweet by and by
