Calling you up on the telephone
Saying goodnight till we get alone
So deep it takes my breath away
My feeling keeps me smiling all the way
Cuddling beneath a blanket for warmth
Holding your hand while we talk
Kissing while it rains from above
etting about time when we talk
Life goes by
Life goes fast, all my life I'm falling in love, no
To the past every day
I'm falling in love with you
With you
The train pulls out in a minute
Rolling down to the lake
We'll take a boat to the island
Getting lost for all day
The squirrels here ain't too shy
The seagulls scream and shout
We can lie in the grass for hours
Staring at the white clouds above
Life goes by
Life goes fast
All my life
I'm falling in love
No, I'll wait through the past
Every day I'm falling in love with you
There is so much pressuring us
So much keeping us apart
I wanna break free from all of that
I want to run into your arms (to the end)
I smile and put your hands in mine
Just let me hold you one more time
Please never wanna let me go
Like on the day we fell in love
Life goes by
Life goes fast
All my life
I'm falling in love
No way to the past
Every day I'm falling in love with you
With you, with you
