Should I have feared when I drove on the wrong side
Should I have steered when I keep on falling from the sky
But I ask you if you could be so kind
And try to sell me a little peace of mind
I could have fallen down my wishing well and I'd stay for the change
I could have dodged a thousand bullets but I think I would rather stand in the way
Yeah, too right
I need some time away
Yeah, too
I need a holiday
I'm done with all the reasons for existing on this one show stage
Boring me
I need a natural disaster just to keep me entertained
Through the day
Yeah too right
I need some time away
Yeah to write
I need an escapade
So somebody catch my head it's floating away
Was it something said that's speaking out your brain
You wanna change your life or serve serve your plate
Stop sounding out your charms before I take your seats
I don't wanna be the same
Why do I have to be the same
Intortions, intortions
Are keeping my nights awake
I profess from nothing
When I'm living my life this way
Why do I have to be the same
Why I'm just a minnow in the lake
The lake
Heal yourself, heal yourself, heal yourself
I'm running away, I'm running away
Running away
This place is the real center of my home
I'm driven to wherever I want
Stopping in the fourth dimension
Mirror mirror give me that reflection
This is me this is where I belong
In a place where the first signs don't go
Pulled down from all existence
I'm pleased to walk out this time
Screwed up for me, and I've been screwed up for me, and I've been screwed up for me, hey, hey, I screwed up for me
Heal yourself
Heal yourself
Heal yourself
I'm running away
Heal yourself
Heal yourself
Heal yourself
Away
