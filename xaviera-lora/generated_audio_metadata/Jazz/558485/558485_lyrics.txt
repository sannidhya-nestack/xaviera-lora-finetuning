Maybe it's the rain
That's got me so confused
Or maybe it's the pain
Of having to choose
Between the two of you
Weather is the weather
Are the stories in my heart
I can show you with love
He's coming for it
Oh catch me if you can
I don't really want another man
I am not secure I must be sure
Of old fashioned love
