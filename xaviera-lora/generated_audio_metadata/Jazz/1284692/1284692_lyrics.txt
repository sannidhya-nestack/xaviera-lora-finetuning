Can my love for you
Be measured in a dandelion's flight?
And why do moonbeams
Insist upon the darkness of night?
And if the dream's right
Love would be counted like half the life of a tree
Would it make what you're feeling any sweeter for me?
And would we do it again if we knew where our love went?
Would lead us
To the place where we must hide in the darkness of night
Love took command
Love held our hand
So let's give love a chance
And let's take romance
Because it would be tragic
To lose the sweet magic
That we know so well
So let's just close the door
And make love like we've been
Before the night begins
And in the darkness of night
Let's fly away
Let's
Fly away today
