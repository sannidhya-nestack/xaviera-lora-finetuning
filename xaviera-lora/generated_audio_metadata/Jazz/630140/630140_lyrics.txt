You smoulder with a voice of pure gold
It's perfection sent from heaven
You're calling with a message in that song
The passion and the memories linger on
I'll keep waiting
I'll be staying here for you
It's amazing when the lady sings the blues
We listen after midnight on the early morning show
The night owls and the truckers when the world is moving slow
I look outside the window it's such a peaceful time of day
Chilling with the music
So easy is the pace
The magic of the stars up in the sky
They compliment the feeling here inside
It's amazing when the lady sings the blues
Sings the blues
It's amazing, amazing, amazing
Hypnotising rhythm, then she put her spell on me
A beautiful rendition of the sweetest melody
Timeless are those records from a golden age of jazz
They're never gonna leave us
Happy living in the past
Unwinding as the DJ says goodbye
I'll rerun all the memories in my dreams tonight
I'll be singing
I'll be swaying
To your tune
Oh, it's amazing, amazing, amazing when the lady sings the blues
