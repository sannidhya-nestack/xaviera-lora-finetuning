Well, I know I might seem just a little naive
But the sun is out and I have to believe
It's gonna be a beautiful day
Laugh all you want, call me a fool
But I'm just relaxing sitting by the pool
Pull up a chair, sit back and stay
Come on, breathe it in
The sun warms your skin
There's a cool breeze blowing in from our ocean view
Baby, let it go
Come on, take it slow
I just want to spend the whole day taking it easy with you
I know the world's an unsightly mess
But you look so pretty in your summer dress
You help to chase my bad mood away
Tomorrow we can worry about the economy
Or the fact that I'm working out a tasty freeze
There'll be no worries, at least for today
Come on breathe it in
The sun warms your skin
There's a cool breeze blowing in from our ocean view
Baby let it go
Come on take it slow
I just wanna spend the whole day taking it easy with you
Come on take my hand
And we'll walk along the sand
The stars so clear and bright
They'll block out the world tonight
Come on, breathe it in
The sun warms your skin
There's a cool breeze blowing in from our ocean view
Baby, let it go
Come on, take it slow
I just wanna spend the whole day taking it easy with you
Come on, take my hand
And we'll walk along the sand
With stars so clear and bright
They'll block out the world tonight
We don't have money but we'll have some fun
We'll lie on the beach and bake in the sun
We'll body surf on the incoming waves
We'll get a little crazy take a chance or two
We'll try a few things we wouldn't usually do
I'm feeling good and a little bit brave
Come on, breathe it in
The sun warms your skin
There's a cool breeze blowing in from our ocean view
Baby, let it go
Come on, take it slow
I just wanna spend the whole day taking it easy with you
I just wanna spend the whole day taking it easy with you
I just wanna spend the whole day taking it easy with you
