We need some fun
Clear skies and sun
If you're feeling sad and blue
Please do not delay
So come along, spend some time and win a fight
Look for the change in yourself and rearrange
Away from cars and from planes
Heaven is waiting
For you I'm sending hot beaches
So let's all go out, out to the islands (Florida's Islands)
Not very far away, we'll load up the boat (Florida's Islands)
And sail out there, it's not very far away (Florida's Islands)
So let's all go out, out to the islands (Florida's Islands)
Let me use my
For so while
I am sincerely
Wasting away
Day after day
So come along
Spend some time
And when I find
Look for the change in yourself and rearrange
Away from cars and from planes
Heaven is waiting for you on sandy hot beaches
So let's all go up, out to the islands (Floridas Islands)
It's not very far away, we'll load up the boat (Floridas Islands)
And sail out there, it's not very far away (Floridas Islands)
So let's all go up
Out to the islands (goin' up the islands)
So let's all go out, out to the islands (goin' up the islands, goin' up the islands)
They're not very far away, but goin' up the mountains (goin' up the mountains)
We'll sail out there, it's not far away (goin' up the islands)
So let's all go out, out to the islands (goin' up the islands, goin' up the islands)
Let's go out
Out to the islands
They're not very far away, we're not up to fall
And still out there it's not very far away
So let's go out, out to the islands
