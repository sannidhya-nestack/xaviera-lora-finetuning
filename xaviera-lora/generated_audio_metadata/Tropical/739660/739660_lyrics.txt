Can you see the trees growing
Beautiful and pure energy
Can you feel the vibrations
Can you feel the force
Now that I'm aware
Of this beauty surround me
This beauty surround me
Can you feel the force coming over you
Washing like the waves in the sea
Washing you so soft and tenderly
Can you see the trees growing
Beautiful and pure energy
Can you feel the vibrations
Can you feel the force
Now that I'm aware
