When the light you're needing feels so far away
An heartache you believe in disappears and fades now
When it's time to lean in
You can't be afraid
Cause hope is on it's way
You gotta pray for the positive
Give what you gotta give
Live how you wanna live
And always be an optimist
Lose negativity
Be the best that you can be
Bring the change that we all need
Pass the message and plant the seed
You got to pray, pray, pray, pray for the positive seed
There's a higher power
Higher than the sky
Sending out a signal
Helping us to fly (to fly)
You can't have the power
You just got to try
Just try and you can fly
Just try and you can fly
You gotta pray for the positive
Give what you gotta give (Lotta mercy)
Live how you wanna live (How you wanna)
And always be an optimist (Woo)
Lose negativity (Yeah)
Be the best that you can be (You can be now)
Bring the change that we all need (Yeah)
Pass the message and plant the seed
You gotta pray, pray
Pray pray for the positive everything that we ever need waiting in the clouds for you and me everything that we ever need waiting in the clouds for you and me you gotta pray for the positive give what you gotta give live how you wanna live and always be an optimist
Lose negativity
Be the best that you can be (you can be now)
Bring the change that we all need (eh)
Pass the message and plan to see
You gotta pray, pray
Pray, pray for the positive (yeah, yeah)
Pray (you gotta pray now)
Pray, pray for the positive (eh)
