Allez!
Davidoff!
Turn it up, turn it up!
Yeah, no
I got fire on my heels, rhythm in my veins
Coconut lips, sugar in the rain
Boy said, "Mommy," I said, "Don't you dare"
Then I smiled and left him there
Turn around, spin again, we don't stop'til the end
Lose your mind, lose your fear
The night is ours, we disappear
Sure, sure, what?
What? What? What? What?
Light me up let's go, hearts on fire, bodies in control
Twist and burn feel that glow, oh baby mas calor
Salsa inferno, louder than the sun
Nobody leaves till the night is done
Laugh and scream lose your soul, tonight we're out of control
(Woo-hoo!)
Mida chica, drop that flame
Move your body, don't play no game
From Rio streets to Santo Juan
We get wild'til the break of dawn
Hands in the air, shake that floor
DJ scream on Pokémon, you and me
No shame, no rule, we too hot
The world too cool
Spots on my skin
Sin in my smile
The rhythm takes me every mile
Can't escape this, teeth is lost
We're made of rhythm
Made of dust
Side side inferno, side side inferno
Make it loud tonight, hearts on fire, bodies in the light
Clap, shout, scream, ignite, we're burning bright, we're burning right
Side side inferno
Fuego in my soul, no control, no self control
Oh oh eh, oh oh eh
Down to the door, no letting go
Oh oh eh, oh oh eh
Side side inferno, lose it all
Oh oh eh, oh oh eh
We don't say that's all, no letting go (Hold it, hold it)
Shots light and burn, don't lose it all
