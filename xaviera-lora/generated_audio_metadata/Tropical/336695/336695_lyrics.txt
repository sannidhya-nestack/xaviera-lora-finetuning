Once upon a time long ago in a Cuban island lived a man who played in a show
He played his music everyday in a small cafe and he would turn to them and say
Can you feel it?
Feel my rhythm
It played its music everywhere
Everyone was dancing
But from Puerto Rico to San Jose
Everywhere you turn the people say
Have you heard the new rhythm?
It's gonna make you sing and you'll sway
And you'll feel it
Feel his rhythm, hey!
Can you feel the rhythm deep in your soul?
Feel it, it's gonna make you lose your control
Believe it, there's nothing you can do, just let it flow
Jump in it, and let your body move and just say
Kachiki-witai
Ah-ha!
Wawelo!
Ahora!
Wow!
Now a hundred years have gone by
Can you hear the rhythm?
Still played now, it's still alive
It plays music every day in Jimmy's Brons Cafe
And everyone begins to dance and sing
Can you feel it? Feel his rhythm
So try to hide your feelings now
There's no use denying it
Gonna take control of you today
And if you think you can't resist
You're gonna be surprised now
By the words you hear yourself say
Can you feel it?
Feel his rhythm
Can you feel the rhythm deep in your soul
Feel it, it's gonna make you lose your control
Believe it, there's nothing you can do, just let it blow
Jump in it, let your body move and just say
Get jiggy with it
Tocalo, Arturo, así
