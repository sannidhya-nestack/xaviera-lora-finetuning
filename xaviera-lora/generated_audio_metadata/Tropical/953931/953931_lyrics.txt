Making love in the afternoon
It's like a flower that's in full bloom
You're so fine, you're the sunshine of my life
Take advantage of the sunny skies
I love the way it lights up your eyes
You're so fine, you're the sunshine of my life
Ooh, I love the way it gazes at me
Ooh, you can have your way with me
I love the touch and the scent of your skin
That's the way it's always been
I've lived this sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
The simple life is what I seek
A lazy day to bring release
You're so fine
You're the sunshine of my life
Other friends may come and go
There is no one who will ever know what love is like
You're the sunshine of my life
Ooh, I love the way you gaze at me
Ooh, you can have your way with me
I love the touch in the center of your skin
That's the way it's always been
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you
I've lived the sunshine life
Ever since I've known you, ooh, ooh
It's such a life, life
The sunshine light
The sunshine light
We are living the sunshine
Living the sunshine light
We are living the sunshine
Living the sunshine light
We are living the sunshine, living the sunshine life
The sunshine life
