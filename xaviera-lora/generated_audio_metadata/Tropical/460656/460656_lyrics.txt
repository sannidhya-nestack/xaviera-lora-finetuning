Folks'round here still trembling, cowering the tale of a demon whose red eyes glowed in the home sweet swamp down in Floralla, Ithlers
fourteen feet from tail to snout, a gator-like creature who proud to bow got two toes left from the trappy vault and one
Oh, June's so tall
Some say that he's a devil's spawn
Bringing fear from dusk till dawn
Oh, to talk time
Mean Critter
You tried to kill him in all sorts of manners
With shotguns, knives, bricks and hammers
But it only seems to make him madder in the end
Causing a ruckus, taking down cattle
Locking the locals in a deadly battle
In the dark of the night, hear a deadly rattle
So pray
Oh, oh, oh, two-toed town
Some say that he's a devil's foe
Bringing fear from dusty dawn
Whoa, choo-choo-cha
Old man hates it, it's gonna get it
Got a bucket and put dynamite in it
Threw it in Tom's fairy pond
And blew it up to hell and beyond
But as they searched the debris filled water
They heard a scream from his granddaughter and fell
Two-toed got her, yes he did
Now, legends range from the 1930s where the facts are few and the details murky
But folks'round here seem more forward about time
recently they found some tracks of a beast scraping through some muddy cracks
There were just two toes on the leg and the back, he's back
Oh, two-toed Tom
Some say that he's the devil's spawn
Bringing fear from dusk till dawn
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
He's the mean one
To go down, to go down
