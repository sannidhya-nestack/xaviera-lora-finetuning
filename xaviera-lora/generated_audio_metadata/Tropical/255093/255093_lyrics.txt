Come sail away with me across the sea to the island where we can live
You see, on the island you can play all day
In the water if you want to'til your heart tells you stop
Or you can lay out in the sun
when you're on island time
There's plenty of time to let you unwind
You see out on the island you can play all day in the water if you want to till your heart tells you stop
Or you can lay out in the sun
You see out on the island you can lay all day
And the water if you want to till your heart tells you stop
And you can lay in the sun till you don't want to lay in the sun anymore
Need I say more?
Come swim away with me
Across the sea to the island
Where we can be free
You see, on the island you can play all day
At the water if you want to
Till your heart tells you stop
Or you can lay out in the sun
Or you can lay out in the sun
Come sail away with me across the sea to the island where we can be free
You see the island there is a beautiful air it'll make you stare at every beautiful girl in the world
And trust me they'll be there too
Or you can lay in the sun
