Every night and every day and
I can feel her close to me and
Call me over, hold me closer and that's the way it should be
In the night time, the sweetest ride time
Blue eyes on the seven seas, whoa
My sweet Melissa, then I kissed her and that's the way it should be
Holy roller, turn me over
Let me feel the light in your eyes
And'til tomorrow, no more sorrow
And that's the way it should be
Love is cuddle, it's a sweet sensation
Love is cuddle for free
You're holding out for a long embrace
But you'll never get that from me, no
Every night and every day and
I can feel her close to me and
Come tomorrow I'll be gone
But that's the way it should be
Love is subtle, it's a sweet sensation
Love is kind of fall free
No holding out for a long embrace
Cause you'll never get that from me, no
Every night and every day and
I can feel your love close to me and
Call me over, hold me closer and that's the way it should be
Hold me closer, ever closer and that's the way it should be
