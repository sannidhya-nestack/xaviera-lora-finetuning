Come to the island, lay down your gun
Welcome to my land, let's have some fun
No need to worry, just for a while
No need to hurry
Let's see you smile
Taking the beauty that's all around
When you are ready head into town
There you'll find natives colorfully clad
Sweet island music makes you feel glad
Soon you'll be dancing, finding your way
To sweet romancing, that's when you say
Sweet island woman, will you marry me?
We'll live our lives where we can be free
Come to the island
Lay down your gun
Welcome to my land
Let's have some fun
No need to worry
Just for a while
No need to hurry
Let's see you smile
Taking the beauty
That's all around
When you are ready, head into town
There you'll find natives, colourfully clad
Sweet island music, makes you feel glad
Soon you'll be dancing, finding your way
Due sweet romancing, that's when you say
Sweet island woman, will you marry me?
We'll live our lives where we can be free
