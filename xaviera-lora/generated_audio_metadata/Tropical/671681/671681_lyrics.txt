A secret place, a hideaway
Rock and sand and sea
Burning sun, cool breeze
An island for you and me
Away, we'll never sail away
Life just a game to play
Sky Island
Sky Island
The world is our entertainment
Sit back and have some fun
Clouds form, zebras laughing
Dancing in the sun
Wave will never sail away
Life just a game to play
Sky Island
Oh sky, I love
The sun's run on forever
For us there is no time
Golf circle ever so slowly
Watching the faces hide
Away, we'll never sail away
Life's just a game to play
Sky Island
Sky Island
Sky Island
Oh sky
I love, oh, mmm
