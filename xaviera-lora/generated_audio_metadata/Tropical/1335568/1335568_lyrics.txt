Let's bounce with it, oh, yeah, yeah
Aye, let's bounce with it, gotta swerve with it
Let's run with it, let's move like this
Buss it down, buss it, buss it
Buss it down with it, it
Everybody gotta pop drop and lock it like that
Hey baby, hey baby, hurricane swervin' it
Girls out here breakin' necks
Shawty bust down like she payin' rent, ooh
Yeah, let's bounce with it, gotta swerve with it
Let's run with it, let's move like this
Buss it down, buss it, buss it
Buss it down with it, it
It's that trap, trap, no rush, rush
Beats bangin', no hush, hush
Everybody just vibin' like Cisco
No flashpoint, just vroom, vroom
No gas leak, mob crew, they got you
Ayy let's bounce with it, gotta swerve with it, let's run with it, let's move like this
Buss it down, buss it buss it, buss it down with it
Ayy let's bounce with it, gotta sverve with it, let's run with it, let's move like this
Buss it down, buss it buss it, buss it down with it
