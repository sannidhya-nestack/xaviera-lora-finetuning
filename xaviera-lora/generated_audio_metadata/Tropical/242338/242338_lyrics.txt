It comes to life, I take my chances
I throw it all up in the air
I do my best to beat the odds
But after that I just don't care
I've never bowed before a dollar
Never thought it made much sense
You squeeze it'til it makes you hollow
Such an empty recompense
But our love's the one thing
I know to be true
And my life is empty
And cold without you
So no matter what kind of shape this world's in
Our love's the one sure thing
When it comes to life I take my chances
I throw it all up in the air
I do my best to beat the odds
But after that I just don't care
I've never bowed before the dollar
Never thought it made much sense
You squeeze it'til it makes you holler
Such an empty recompense
But our love's the one thing I know to be true
And my life is empty and cold without you
So no matter what kind of shape this world's in
Our love's the one sure thing
One sure thing
One sure thing
