And when it's time for company, yeah
Love will whisper it to me
And life ain't so bad or so it seems
And when it's time for company, yeah
And now we're gonna light the light
No, no, no, no
Ooh
Now we're gonna light the light
Ooh
When it's time for company, yeah
And life ain't so bad, or so it seems
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
