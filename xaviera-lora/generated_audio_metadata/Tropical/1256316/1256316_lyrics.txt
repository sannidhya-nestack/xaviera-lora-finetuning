Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
High on life in highlands
Living high on life we in highlands
Living out our life in the islands
A magical place
Full of history
A nautical town
The fishermen and sea
A mystical retreat
Come journey and explore
The gateway
To the Jersey Shore
Mount Mitchell overlook
Across the bridge to Sandy Hook
C Street ferry from MRC
It's a short cruise way
Battery Lewis in Bedford Park
The water which comes out after dark
The twilight shines so bright
Let the lighthouse guide your way
Leave your worries behind
All the peace you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living high on life in highlands
Relax, do what you want
A boat full of green is fine, restaurants
Out of your kayak, it's so much fun
Or just bask in the sun
Fishing off a bulkhead, drinking beer
Neighbours always gather here
Watching the sunset fade away, a romantic getaway
Grab your guitar and join a band
Music playing all across the land
So much to see, so much to do
Spend the time in islands with you
Spend the time in islands with you
Leave it all behind
For the love you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out our life in highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out our life in highlands
Living out our life in highlands
High on life, being high on land
Living high on life, doing high on land
High on life, being high on land
Living high on life, being high on land
High on life, so high, living high on land
Say high, high, high, high on land
