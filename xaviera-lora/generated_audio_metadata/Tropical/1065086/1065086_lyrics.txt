I saw your face, your warm sweet smile
At all at once my heart stood still
It seems for just a little while
I said hello, oh my oh no
What did I do, what did I say
Oh please oh please don't go away
I know a place where we could go
Where we could get to know each other
Have some wine, lights are low and we can dance
The whole night through
Together swaying to the music
What I really wanna do
I like to swing, I like to trot
I do the cha-cha-cha a lot
Waltz, the minuet, merengue, mamba, rumba too
These dances move my very soul
They make me feel real close to you
They say romance is in the air
And babe that's what I wanna do
And while we dance across the room
I feel your body close to mine
The fragrance of your sweet perfume
And we can dance the whole night through
To give the swing to the music's what I really wanna do
I like to swing, I like to trot
I do the cha-cha-cha a lot
Waltz the minuet, merengue, mambo, rumba too
These dances move my very soul and make me feel real close to you
They say romance is in the air and babe that's what I wanna do
I like to swing, I like to trot, I do the cha-cha-cha a lot
Waltz the minuet, merengue, mamba, rumba too
These dances move my very soul and make me feel really close to you
They say romance is in the air
And that's what I wanna do
