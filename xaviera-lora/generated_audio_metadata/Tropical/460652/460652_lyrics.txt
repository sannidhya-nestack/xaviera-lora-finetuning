Woah, come on jump into the line
Woah, grab on to the next waistline
Woah, the music makes you feel so fine
Woah, we're here to join the conga line
The band lays down rhythm, we have to join with them
Feeling the drums beat
We can't help but move our feet
Let's get this dance started
You can't be help hearted
Give it your best shot
We want to see just what you got
Oh oh oh
Come on jump into the line
Oh oh oh
Grab on to the next waistline, oh
The music makes you feel so fine, oh
We're here to join the conga line
We're here for a good time
We know it's a good time
When our body's moving
'Til the music's groovin'
Come on, don't be shy
Why don't you jump in and try
Lift your hands up in the air
Now move and get off your chair
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Come on, jump into the line
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Grab onto the next waistline
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Good music makes you feel so fine
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We're here to join the conga line
Oh yeah, we're jumping the country line, ooh-ha-ha-ha, yeah
Get in that line, oh-ha, ooh-ha
Oh, come on, jump into the line
Oh, grab onto the next waistline
Oh, the music makes you feel so fine
Oh, we're here to join the conga, laddie
Why sit on your bottom?
Don't you like to have some fun?
When bodies get shaky
The floor starts quaking
The light's picking up steam
We're caught in it's lipstream
Don't try to fight it
Just give in and try it
Woah
Come on jump into the light
Woah
Grab into the next waistline, oh oh oh
The music makes you feel so fine, oh oh oh
We're here to join the conga line, oh oh oh
Come on jump into the line, oh oh oh
Grab onto the next waistline
Oh oh oh
The music makes you feel so fine
Oh oh oh
We're here to join the conga line
