I'm living on this island called paradise
I'm living on this island where I don't think twice
And I laze all day, watch the flying fish play
While the monkeys chatter and nothing ever matters
That's why I'm living on this island
Go paradise
I'm living on this island
Where I don't think twice
Then in from the sea there flows a soft breeze
That calls me down, squaves the palm tree leaf
A hummingbird hovers as he takes a sip
Of the sweetened nectar from a pretty flower's lip
I'm living on this island called paradise
I'm living on this island where I don't think twice
When the coconuts arrive
You catch'em as they fall
You drink the milk
So sweet and cold
And young lovers kiss in the setting sun
Everybody's happy having so much fun
I'm living on this island called paradise
I'm living on this island where I don't think twice
And I laze all day whilst the flying fish play
While the monkeys chatter and nothing ever matters
Here the girls are pretty and the fish taste great
There's guava and yams and mangoes on your plate
Now I'm dozing here with a beer in my hand
And there's no end of ice cold can
I'm living on this island called paradise
I'm living on this island where I don't think twice
And the sandy beach is white
Skies see bright blue
The music's calypso
And I'm in love with you
That's why I'm living on this island called paradise
I'm living on this island where I don't think twice
I'm living on this island called paradise
