Hurry up and be here today
You never know what come what may
Gratifying and it's good fun
Nobody down not anyone
We can party with our friends
And no money for us to spend
River moving all we know
It's Calypso it's such a show
We have no fortune or no fame
Only ourselves that we can blame
But we are rich in many ways
So come and dance for now a days
Not specific, it's so loose
Use your body and shake your juice
Capture the behold in your heart
Give your spirit, come let it start
(laughs)
Rhythm moving
It's Calypso
Rhythm moving
It's Calypso
Rhythm moving
It's Calypso it's such a show
(laughs)
