Woke up this morning feeling bad
Worst feeling I ever had
You know I'm lonesome and I don't know what to do
I'm lonesome, lonesome for you
Wish you would call me on the telephone
Tell me baby that you're coming home
You know I'm lonesome
And I don't know what to do
I'm lonesome, lonesome for you
Lay down last night I couldn't sleep
Had the blues in my bed and it's worrying me
You know I'm lonesome and I don't know what to do
I'm lonesome, lonesome for you
I've had the blues before, I'll have the blues some more
I would lose these blues if you would walk through my door
You know I'm lonesome and I don't know what to do
I'm lonesome, lonesome for you
Woke up this morning feeling bad
Worst feeling I ever had
You know I'm lonesome
And I don't know what to do
I'm lonesome
I'm lonesome for you
