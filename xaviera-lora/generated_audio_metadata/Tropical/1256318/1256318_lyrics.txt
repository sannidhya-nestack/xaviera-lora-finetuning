Come and see how fine life can be
Living our life in highlands
A magical place full of history
A nautical town for fishermen and sea
A mystical retreat, come journey and explore
The gateway to the Jersey Shore
Mount Mitchell overlook
Across the bridge to Sandy Hook
A C Street ferry from M .I .C.
It's a short cruise away
Battery Lewis and Veterans Park
The water which comes out after dark
The twilight shines so bright
Let the lighthouse guide your way
Leave your worries behind
For the peace you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out your life in highlands
Relax, do what you want
My boat's full of readers, found restaurants
Out of your kayak, it's so much fun
I'll just bask in the sun
Fishing off a bulkhead, drinking beer
Neighbours always gather here
Watching the sunset fade away, a romantic getaway
Grab your guitar and join a band
Music playing across the land
So much to see, so much to do
Spending time in highlands with you
Leave it all behind
For the love you'll find
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living high on life in highlands
High on life in highlands
Everything's alright down the shore
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out your life in highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Say hi, hi, hi, hi, highlands
Come and see how fine life can be
Living out your life in highlands
Living out your life in highlands
High on life, in highlands
Living high on life, we're in highlands
High on life, in highlands
Living high on life, in highlands
High on life, so high
Living high on life, in highlands
Living high on life, so high
Living high on life
Living high on life, in highlands
Highlands
