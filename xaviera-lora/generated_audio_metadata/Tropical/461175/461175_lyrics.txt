Come me amoar
Come to my shore
Come forevermore
Come to my shore
The palm trees gently swaying
Beneath the sky clear blue
A native girl is waving
She's beckoning to you
Call me no more
Come to my shore
Come forevermore
Come to my shore
The sun is brightly shining
The waves caress the sands
The breeze is softly calling you
Come share this Eden's land
Come be a moor
Come to my shore
Come forevermore
Come to my shore
Come me o'er more
Come to my shore
Come forever more
Come to my shore
The sun is gently setting
Upon a pristine beach
The island seems to offer
A peace within your reach
Come, you moor
Come to my shore
Come forevermore
Come to my shore
Come, me or more
Come to my shore
Come forever more
Come to my shore
Come, me or more
Come to my shore
Come forever more
Come to my shore
Come to my shore
Come to my shore
