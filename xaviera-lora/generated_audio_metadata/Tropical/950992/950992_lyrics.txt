I know a little place for these dimming nights
We can drink straight tequila until the morning light
Exquisitely exotic, it's a place to be
Frantically hypnotic, the people set us free
The people set us free
Siesta, fiesta, Club Mexicana
Hot fashion, hot passion, Club Mexicana
Let's tango and mambo, Club Mexicana
Lambada manana, Club Mexicana
Gypsy lady, drop me crazy with your dancing eyes
You're the queen of Havana, let's rendezvous tonight
Seductively intimate, it's the place to be
Suggestively passionate, the beat will set us free
The beat will set us free
Siesta, fiesta, Club Mexicana
Hot passion, hot passion, Club Mexicana
Let's tango and mambo, Club Mexicana
Lambada manana, Club Mexicana
Si esta, si esta Club Mexicana
Hot passion, hot passion Club Mexicana
Let's tango and mambo Club Mexicana
