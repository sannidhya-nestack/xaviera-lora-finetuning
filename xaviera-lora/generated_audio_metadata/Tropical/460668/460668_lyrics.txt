Yes, ma'am, he'll bring you mojitos
Need things, just let him know
Yes, ma'am, he's your commander boy
Oh how, he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a tandy light
Yes, ma'am, he's your commander boy
Oh, the divorcees with alimony checks
Hang by the poolside and stare at his pecks
They find little errands for him to run
They love to watch him as he glistens in the sun
Yes, ma'am, he'll bring you mojitas
Need things? Just let him know
Yes, ma'am, he's your cabana boy
Oh how he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a tandy light
Yes, ma'am, he's your cabana boy
Women's husbands are golfing at the club
Ask the sadonis to give them a rub
Splash on the lotion, pour it on slick
Take your sweet time, boy, lay it on thick
Yes, mom, he'll bring you mojitos
Need things? Just let him go
Yes, mom, he's your cabana boy
Oh how he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a tandy light
Yes, mom, he's your cabana boy
They're getting tipsy from the drinks that he serves
They'd like to caress him but they haven't got the nerve
So the liquor keeps flowing to make sure he comes
They dream of his warm lips as the rum makes them numb
So yes, mom, he'll bring you mojitos
Need things? Just let him know
Yes, mom, he's your cabana boy
Oh how, he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a dandy light
Yes ma'm, he's your cabana boy
Perhaps he is clueless or maybe naive
He seems not to notice the spell that he weaves
Whether it's conscious or a real clever ploy
The women all tip well for this muscle pool boy
Yes, ma'am, he'll bring you mojitas
Need things? Just let him know
Yes, ma'am, he's your commander boy
Oh how he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a Tandy light
Yes, ma'am, he's your Cabana boy
Yes, ma'am, he'll bring you Mojitos
Need things, just let him know
Yes, ma'am, he's your Cabana boy
Oh how he glows in the sunlight
Oh my, he's a Tandy light
Yes, ma'am, he's your Cabana boy
He's your commando boy
