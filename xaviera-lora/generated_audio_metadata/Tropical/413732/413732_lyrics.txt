Eco, eco, eco, eco
Eco, eco, eco, eco
Life was so simple, life was so plain
Then the government told me that I had to change
the world was dying, pollution and acid rain
It was all my fault
Yeah, I got all the blame
So I spent all my money
On solar panel frames
But they just don't work
In the dark or the pouring rain
And my new wind turbine
Is killing all the birds
It makes so much noise
Our voices can't be heard
Eco Eco
Eco Eco
Eco Eco
Eco Eco
I got the eco blue
I got the eco blues
Now I spend all my time
Sorting out my trash
They won't collect it
Until it's neatly stashed
I got a bin for my foodstuffs
A bin for glass
And one for all the paper I use to wipe my ass
A bin for plastic and a bin for my tins
If I don't recycle it's a deadliest sin
Eco, eco
I got the eco blues (eco, eco, eco, eco, eco)
I got the eco blues
I got the eco blues
They tell me I can't blow up because my greenhouse gas
Will melt the polar ice caps and turn on the taps
Of rising seas that'll flood all the town
Yeah, my bad wind has got to stop or else we all drown
Oh, eco, eco, eco, eco, got the eco blues, eco, eco
Now I spend all my time sorting out my trash
They won't collect it until it's neatly stashed
I got a pin for foodstuff, a pin for glass
And one ball of paper I use to wipe my ass
I got the eco blues
I got the eco blues
I got the eco blues
I got the eco blues
