Each night we map out our escape to a far away isle
We'll sail out of sight with nothing but blue for a thousand miles
And when we reach that endless beach
We'll know that we are finally free
And then we'll be living our tropical fantasy
Starfish we rescue and toss into the waves
And then I steal a kiss
And we retreat into the shade
And on a blanket in the sand
Holding you so tenderly
Together and loving
Our tropical fantasy
The sun is gone asleep, there's passion on the wind
And in each other's arms, love will never end
In our tropical fantasy
And we can leave our past behind
And be who we were meant to be
And really start living our tropical fantasy
