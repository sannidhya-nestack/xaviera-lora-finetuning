Rain fall, body sweep on the wall, the pon de dance hall
Me no worry if your man won't call
Body sweep on the wall, the pon de dance hall
Say tonight you gonna be my girl
Body sweep on the wall, the pon de dance hall
Me no worry if your man won't call
Body sweep on the wall, the pon de dancehall
Say tonight me make your water fall
Tonight we make a waterfall
We don't see how you flex
Me nah waste nah time
Feel the grind from the hard wine
Come prime for the sex
Taste salt pon your neck
Make your body wanna be mine
Skin bruised from the feel of me love bite
Mom flick pon me dick and your skin tight
Do you feel like getting wet tonight?
Rain fall, body sweep on the wall, the ponty dance hall
Me no worry if your man want call
Body sweep on the wall, the ponty dance hall
Say tonight you gonna be my girl
Body sweep on the wall, the ponty dance hall
Me no worry if your man want call
Body sweep on the wall, the ponty dance hall
Say tonight me make your water fall
Tonight me make your water fall
Waterfall, waterfall, tonight we make a waterfall
Rain fall, body sweep on the wall, the pon di dance hall
Me no worry if your man won't call
Body sweep on the wall, the pon di dance hall
Say tonight you gonna be my girl
Body sweep on the wall, the pon di dance hall

Body sweep on the wall, the pon di dancehall
Say tonight me make you waterfall

Tonight me make a waterfall, waterfall, waterfall
Tonight me make a waterfall, waterfall, waterfall
