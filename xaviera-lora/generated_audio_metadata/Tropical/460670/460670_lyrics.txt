Why don't we just call it a day
Pack it up and then walk away
It's really been one of those weeks (oh)
We've had to deal with weirdos and creeps
Counting time until we can go, oh oh oh
The clock is moving way too slow, so
Why don't we just call it a day
Pick it up and then walk away
We've worked all day, there's no need to stay
So why don't we just call it a day
Some of you are working no play (oh oh oh)
Living in a world dull and grey (oh oh oh)
Come on take some small slice of life (oh oh oh)
Take a break from all of the strife
Why don't we just call it a day
We've done our time, let's go out and play
Our brands are here to join in the fray
So why don't we just call it a day
You gotta learn to take a break
You're aiming for a huge headache
So why don't we just call it a day
Pack it up and then walk away
We worked all day, there's no need to stay
So why don't we just call it a day
So why don't we just call it a day
We've done our time
Let's go out and play
You gotta learn to take a break
You're headed for a huge headache
So why don't we just call it a day
Pick it up and then walk away
We worked all day, there's no need to stay
So why don't we just call it a day?
It probably will be a long night
We likely will be up'til daylight
Someone's gonna have some regrets
Do things that they'd like to et
So why don't we just call it a day
Pack it up and then walk away
We worked all day, there's no need to stay
So why don't we just call it a day
We better call it a day
Come on and call it a day
We better call it a day
Come on and call it a day
