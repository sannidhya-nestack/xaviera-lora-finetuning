Climbing up the coconut tree
Sweet fruit for me
Shimmy up, slide on down
Don't let the coconuts hit the ground
Don't touch your coconuts
Don't touch your coconuts
Don't touch your coconuts
Don't touch
Don't touch
People come from near and far
Cities are meant to keep warm
Men and the women alike
Don't touch but look if you like
Don't touch the coconuts
No don't touch coconuts
You can look
But don't touch
Don't touch your coconuts
No, no, don't touch your coconuts
No, no, no, no
Coconuts can mesmerize
I can see it in your eyes
Are you like me when you sleep?
Visions of coconuts in your dreams
Don't touch your coconuts
Don't touch your coconuts
Don't touch your coconuts
Mmm, please don't touch
I used to let them touch the coconuts
You did?
They purge their products too much
Oh no
Don't touch the coconuts
Don't touch the coconuts
Don't touch, no, no, no, no, no touching coconuts (thank you very much)
Don't touch coconuts (I won't touch coconuts)
No, no, no (I won't)
I thank you very much for touching coconuts (oh, no, no)
