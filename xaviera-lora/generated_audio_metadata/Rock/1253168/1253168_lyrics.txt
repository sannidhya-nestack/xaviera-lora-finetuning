Being recast gives me splats
A world far away
By Celestra, by Celestra
Far from the light years away
Where Tangerine sees
His red pink skies
On a cosmic breeze
A magical surprise
Dreaming, dreaming of
Celestra, my favorite love
Dreaming, dreaming of
Celestra, my favorite love
Crystal cities rise
From shimmering sand
Life is beautiful, art, but my whole world land
Your celestial love in spectral hues
Ancient history, mystery's fuse
Drifting in an unseen dream
Whispers sifting cryptic stream
I'm dreaming, dreaming of celestial, my favorite love
I'm dreaming, dreaming of celestial, my favorite love
From the celestial views to the emerald seas, part of something greater
Many destinies connected in time in a magical way
Life on Celestra, let's go and just stay
I'm dreaming, dreaming of Celestra, my favorite love
I'm dreaming, dreaming of Celestra, lost Celestra alone
Can't stop dreaming of celestial love
Never stop dreaming at all celestial love
