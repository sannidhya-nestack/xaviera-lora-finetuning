Passionate nights like raging fire then cold silence bitter like a liar
This love is cursed, blessed and tragic our bond becomes twisted almost magic
One moment you're mine, time you're well but next I feel like I've been hurled into a void of mixed emotions drowning in our ocean of commotions
It's a love hate hurricane
Destroy me then rebuild it again
I can't resist your tempting reign
Even though it leaves me in pain
Though the antidote that's also the poison
My heart's been held hostage by your choices
Pulling me close and pushing away
This euphoric leaves me in pain
I'm a candidate though that's also the poison
My heart's been held hostage by your choices
Pulling me close and pushing away
This euphoric torment will it ever stray?
I'm addicted to your burning touch
But it seems a little too much
I crave the ecstasy you provide
While the agony slowly trips my pride
It's a low-grade hurricane
Storing me, then rebuilding again
I can't resist your tempting reign
Even though it leaves me in pain
This roller coaster of bliss and strife
Consumes my every breath of life
Are we soulmates or sworn enemies?
Your mixed signals keep me on my knees
It's all of a hurricane
Destroying me then rebuilding again
I can't resist your tempting reign
Even though it leaves me in pain
It feeds in pain
You're the antidote that's also the poison
My heart's been held hostage by your choices
Pulling me close then pushing away
This euphoria leaves me in pain
You're the antidote that's also the poison
My heart's been held hostage by your choices
Pulling me close then pushing away
This euphoria don't ever ever stray
I'm addicted to your burning touch
But it seems a little too much
I crave the ecstasy you provide
While the agony slowly shifts my mind
It's no torture to bliss and strife
Consumes my every breath of life
I'll keep so mixed with swollen enemies
Promises will skin me on my knees
It's roller coaster of bliss and strife
Consumes my every breath of life
Are we soulmates or sworn enemies?
Your mixed signals keep me on my knees
It's a love hate hurricane
Destroying me then rebuilding again
I can't resist your tempting reign
Even though it leaves me in pain
