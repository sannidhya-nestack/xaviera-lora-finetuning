They need change, new eyes
New colors for the promise change implies
They need relevance, fear inspires
A familiar face, a visage for reprise
Well he's one man thinking
And one no rating
One man ruling
And one man rating
One man wanting
And one man taking
One man brooding
With vengeful eyes
You need change
A moral intercession
Our sentinel for righteousness arise
They need sustenance, esteem, need strength and shelter
But with one hand to God, allegiance to disguise
You got one man thinking
And one no rating
One man ruling
And one man raining
One man wanting
And one man taking
One man feeding
You lies (oh she won't believe)
You're not so different from your enemies
Your scattered faces shroud the truth (But she'll let you know it knows you won't believe)
And masked in overstated subtlety (No you'll never know what it means to be there to see)
The painful truth you fell into
In the porous excesses of your sin
In the shaded corners of your soul
Beneath the shadows of our skin
Prevails the nature of us all
We need change
New lies
New colors for the promise they've devised
But you won't believe
You're not so different from your enemy
But you won't believe
But your scattered face is shrouded in truth
But you won't believe
And masked in overstated subtlety
The painful truth you know it's you
