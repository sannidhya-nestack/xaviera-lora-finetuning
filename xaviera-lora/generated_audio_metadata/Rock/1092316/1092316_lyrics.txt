Anywhere I am
Wanna be somewhere else
I don't know why
Everyone I meet
Well I see imperfection
When I look into their eyes
I'm desperately in need of protection
I need to cure my affliction
So you see, this is my confession
It's signed by me
I'm desperately in need
Can't you see that I'm in need
Can't you see that I'm mean?
Can't you see that I'm mean, baby?
Everything I do, well it rains untrue
So now I don't even bother to try
Everything I say seems to fall and drift away
I've not even left here to cry
I'm desperately in need of protection
I can't drive through this intersection
So you see, this is my confession
It's signed by me
Desperately, you need
Can't you see that I'm in need?
Can't you see that I'm in need?
Can't you see that I'm in need?
Baby, I'm in need (can't you see that)
Baby, I'm in need (can't you see that)
Baby, I'm in need
(Can't you see that?)
I'm in need
(Can't you see that?)
Baby
(Can't you see that?)
I'm in need
