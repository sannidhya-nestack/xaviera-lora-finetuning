We're young and beautiful
We've got nothing to hide
We've got faith on our side
We only do things that we like
And no one dares to hold us back
And no one sets us rules
So have you got the power yet to step into our shoes?
But sometimes it so happens
There are no words to tell
My deserted mind belongs
To my private head
Hey, you, it's time to be true
So much to do, it's all about us
Oh hey, you, it's time to be true
So much to do, it's all about us
Here we are, strong and proud
And all we do is shout out loud
No longer pressure, no need to feel
No longer darkness and no more doubt
No need to struggle or plan too much
No need to hurry or worry'cause that sucks
Oh baby baby, I love you so
Oh baby baby, can you feel my soul?
You, it's time to be true
So much to do, it's all about us
Oh, hey, you (let's go together)
It's time to be true (let's go together)
So much to do (let's go together)
It's all about us (let's become together)
But sometimes it so happens
There are no words to tell
But I'm telling you, I'm not going to help (4, 5, K)
You (let's go together)
It's time to be true (let's go together)
So much to do (let's go together)
It's all about us, why we come together, oh hey
You, let's come together, it's time to be true
Why we come together, so much to do
Let's come together, it's all about us, why we come together, hey
You, let's come together, it's time to be true
Why we come together
So much to do
Let's go together
It's all about us
Why don't we come together?
Oh hey you
It's all about us
