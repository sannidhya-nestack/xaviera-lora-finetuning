All of this time we spent
Falling like satellites
Falling like satellites
Gravity pulled you in
And you better learn to swim
Swim to the light
If you swim out in, out in the big sea
The big sea maybe you won't find out what you had wondered
A wonder waiting for me
Falling like satellites
Falling like satellites
Falling like satellites
There's a place where you hoped you could find me
Find me baby I won't cry now
Out in the big sea
The big sea wait there for me
If you swim out in, out in the big sea
The big sea maybe you won't find out
What you had wondered, wondered waiting for me
Falling like satellites
Falling like satellites
Falling like satellites
