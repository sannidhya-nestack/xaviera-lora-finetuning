Sun starts to rise, morning shines bright We'll face the day, in this good light
Hand on my hand, step by small step Finding our way, future we prep
Chasing away shadows, together we stand
Hearts beat together across this land
Across this land
Dance in the rain, laugh through our tears
No fear can bind when you are near
Through every storm, we'll find our calm
Guided by love, our sweetest bond
Chasing away shadows, together we stand
Hearts beat together, across this land, ooh
Across this land
Dance in the rain, laugh through our tears
No fear can bind when you are near
Through every storm, we'll find our calm
Guided by love, our sweetest balm
Chasing away shadows, together we stand
Hearts beat together, across this land
