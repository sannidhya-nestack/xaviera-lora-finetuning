This is misery
I slip into the basement for a drink
Another wasted night
Blurry sighted is breaking me in again
All this jealousy grows in me
But I can't let it out
All these words I speak mean everything
But you won't let me in
Meet me, meet me in
Meet me in London for a drink
Shelter breaks away
Save your worries for next week
I know you're spinning out of control
And I'm falling out of sight
Meet me, meet me in
Meet me inside and be complete
Nine days I've been losing sleep'cause I'm puzzled over you
I changed my attitude as I shuffled through your changing moods and you
You've been suffering, smothering your feelings deep inside
If I could change your mind I swear I would make you feel alive
Meet me
Meet me in, meet me in London for a drink
Shelter, bricks away, save your worries for next week
I know you're spinning out of control and I'm falling out of sight
Meet me
Meet me in, meet me inside and be complete
You never let yourself go
You won't let anybody know
Why you're always someone else
But tonight, tonight you're all alone like me
There are only words, there are only words between us
But we don't talk at all anymore
We don't talk about it if you're alone
As much as I'm feeling alone
Meet me where we started, where we started
And leave this all behind
Meet me, meet me in
Meet me in London for a drink, shelter
Breaks away
Save your worries for next week
I know you're spinning out of control
But I'm only a step behind
Meet me
Meet me in
Meet me inside and be complete
Complete
Complete
Complete
Champagne, Champagne, Champagne
