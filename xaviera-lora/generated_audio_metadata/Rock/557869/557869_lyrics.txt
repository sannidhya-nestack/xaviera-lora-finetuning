Hey girl, you ready? Let's go, one, two, three, four
Time to get so sad, yup, get real right
I be passin' all of my drink and limit tonight
My homegirls got me, they gon' make sure I'm good
after the club them grooves gon' be out like what's good?
I got my pumps on, yeah, six inches
Oh yeah, and I'm steppin' hard like what's good, bitch
I'll be the baddest one, oh wait hold up
I see the shorty in the corner and I think she wants time
Love the way she look at me
The way she move her body with her eyes on me
She ain't even gotta say a thing
I'll give her all the singles on the VIP
Hey girl, yeah, you're looking real good (good)
Gotta come back to my place, well, I think you should (but)
Before you go, take the shot of Patron (but)
When you get back to my crib, make sure you got a way home
Hey girl, yeah, you're looking real good
Gotta come back to my place, well, I think you should (but)
Before you go, take the shot of Patron (but)
When you get back to my crib, make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
So now she walked over to me (oh yeah)
Laser lights is bouncing up her body (girl you got it)
She came real close to me and started grabbing my hair
She said what's your name and where you from?
What you mean where I'm from?
She got me in a daze but trust me I'm not afraid
I spoke to her in her ears said you need to come with me
She up with no hesitation (to the dance floor)
We the center of attention (let's give'em what they waiting for)
I see that you're enjoying me
The way you move your hips while you grind on me
I really hope that you're single
if you got a man (then he gotta go) (then he go) (then he go)
Then he gotta go (hey girl) (yeah, you're looking real good)
Come back to my place, well I think you should
Before you go, you take a shot of Patron
When you get back to my crib, make sure you got a way home
Hey girl, yeah you lookin' real good
You wanna come back to my place, well I think you should
Before you go, take the shot of Patron
And when you get back to my crib, make sure you got a way home
Look at me, now look at you
Look at you, now look at me
Too bad girls, sexy girls, let me see what you can do
I'm aggressive so I touch
Liquor spilling out my cup
My eyes are wavy, I'm so gone
Watch my hands while they roll
So, you ever been with a girl before?
Oh, I -<|4.60|>
Hey girl, yeah you lookin' real good
Don't wanna come back to my place
Well, I think you should
But before you go
Take a shot of Patron
Before you get back to my crib
Make sure you got a way home
Hey girl, yeah you lookin' real good
You wanna come back to my place, well I think you should
Before you go, take the shot of Patron
And when you get back to my crib, make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
Make sure you got a way home
