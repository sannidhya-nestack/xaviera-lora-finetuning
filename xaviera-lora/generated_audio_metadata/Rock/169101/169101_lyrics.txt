Open road, open mind, I'm stepping out
So glad to leave it all, I had to leave it all
Took a chance on love, but it feels so right
Can't turn back this time, what I'm going for is mine
There's no stopping me, ain't giving up nothing
There's nothing worth talking about anyway
'Cause we're together, oh pretty baby
We're growing stronger every day
Oh, I'm okay riding this wave
Let my heart show me the way
Don't always know where to go
Gotta take my own road
I'm okay riding this wave
Let my heart show me the way
Don't always know where to go, I
Gotta take my own road
We ain't leaving nothing
That's worth talking'bout
You're not worth talking'bout anyway
Got a new baby, and we're together
Growing stronger every day
Oh, I'm okay riding this wave
Let my heart show me the way
Don't always know where to go, my
Gotta take my own road
I'm okay riding this wave
Let my heart show me the way
Don't always know where to go
Gotta take my own road
Live and ready
To reach so high
I set myself free
So let's just say goodbye
Got a new baby
And we're ready to take this dream and make it fly
Oh, I'm okay riding this wave
Let my heart show me the way
Don't always know where to go but
Gotta take my own road, I've
Gotta take my own road, I've
Gotta take my own road
