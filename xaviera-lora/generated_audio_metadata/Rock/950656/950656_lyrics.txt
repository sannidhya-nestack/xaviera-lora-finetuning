Hey, I've lost myself
But I can find my way out of this
Hell, no need to doubt
This flame will burn me, rip me inside out
Hey, I've lost myself
But I can find my way out of this
Hell, no need to doubt
This flame will burn me, rip me inside out
Oh no!
Stand up, load up, with my bill
Make it even more real
Hold up, can't stop, I need more rub
This poison to live, pressure's increasing
What's the jam on my chest?
Took a pill and don't even look I'm distressed
Now I see my opponent is me
To be unfettered with me and my need
Hey, I've lost myself
And I can't find my way out of this
Hell, no need to doubt
This one will burn me, rip me inside out
Oh yeah
I force some more mindful pills
Take a day off and chill
Cut you way through your addiction
So let's close the deal
Your body's trembling
And I see the fire in your eyes
Reach in and grab what you most desire
Now I see you're so weak, you can't break
Reach your hand and take what you want from me
Hey, you've lost yourself
And you won't find your way out of this
Hell, no need to doubt
This will burn you, rip you inside out
I'm trapped inside a cell
I'm drowning in the well
The water's rising there's no air
I can't breathe
I'm suffocated
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Hey, I've lost my self, and I am on my way out of this hell
No need to doubt, this will burn you, reap you, is laid out
Hey, you've lost yourself, and you'll find your way out of this hell
No need to doubt, this will burn you, reap you, is laid out
