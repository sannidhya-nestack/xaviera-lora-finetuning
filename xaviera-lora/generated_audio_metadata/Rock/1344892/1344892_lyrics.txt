I was drinking whiskey, she asked for soda water
I was pushing fifty, she could have been my daughter
Temptation, temptation is a terrible thing
But if you don't resist it
You might just wind up losing everything
Was a nickel for a quarter
I never got her name
When I asked the old night porter
She was gone
Oh, so he claimed and temptation, temptation got me in a bind
If I can't overcome it, I'm surely gonna lose my mind
They got my wallet where they found her
When they dragged her body from the scene
Somebody's gone and drowned her
I just couldn't stand the pain
And temptation
Temptation pushed me round the bend
Yeah, I let it get the best of me
I'm gonna wind up dead in the end
