Time to release
The devil that's inside of me now
This is a time to rise
This is a call to arms
You can't go on
We're holding our stand
Stand up and hear'em
I call to arms
We've had our fill of the lies you're feeding us
You won't stop until we're under your control
Time to rise
Time to heal
Time to release
The devil that's inside of me now
This is our time to rise
This is our call to arms
You can't go on holding us down
Stand up and hear
I call to arms
This is our time to rise
This is our call to arms
Can't go on holding us down
Stand up and hear our call to arms
Oh, hey, oh
