Remembering the first time
Your smile just took my breath away
The moments that we had
We didn't need any words to say
Today we bring the future
And all before is only history
Let's celebrate this moment
Show the world just how great it can be
You just turn yourself
To the better half
Ooh, step into the light
Ooh, into my sight
Ooh, into the light
Ooh, take a bow
et the lonely days
Let the colors bring you joy and love
The light lies before you, you know it fits ya
It fits like a glove, glove
Just step into me, for everyone to see, yeah
Ooh, step into the light, to the light, yeah
Into the light, into the light, into the light, into the light
Now that everyone can see and trust to be a friend until eternity
Told you how to find your way out of the dark
this was where you're meant to be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come on now
Here is the key
Here is the key
Into the light
Here is the key
Here is the key
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light
