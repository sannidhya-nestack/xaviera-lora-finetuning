Why can't, why can't, why can't, why can't we agree to disagree
A different path, a different clash, a different look
A different sight, a different guide, a different book (a different book)
A different place, a different face, are we the same? (are we the same?)
A different pain, a different brain, are we insane?
Why can't we agree to disagree?
Why's it so damn hard for us to see
That we're not so different, you and me
If we learn to live in harmony
If we learn to live in harmony
A different seed
A different breed
A different creed
A different creed
A different team
A different dream
A different gene
A different tool, a different role, a different school
A different race, a different fate, is it too late?
Why can't we agree to disagree
Why's it so damn hard for us to see
That we're not so different you and me
If we learn to live in harmony
If we learn to live in harmony
Do you believe in harmony?
Can we achieve some harmony in time? (Do you believe in harmony?)
Can we achieve some harmony in time? (Do you believe in harmony?)
Can we achieve some harmony in time? (Do)
Can we achieve some harmony in time?
A different path, a different class, a different look
A different side, a different guide, a different book
A different place, a different face, are we the same?
A different pain, a different brain, are we insane?
Why can't we agree to disagree
Why is it so damn hard for us to see
That we're not so different, you and me
If we learn to live in harmony
Why can't we agree to disagree
Why is it so damn hard for us to see
That we're not so different you and me
If we learn to live in harmony
If we learn to live in harmony
If we learn to live in harmony
If we learn to live in harmony
