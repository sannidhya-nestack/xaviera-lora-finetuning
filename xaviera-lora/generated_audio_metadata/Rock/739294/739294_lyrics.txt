You're a looking glass for my heart and soul
You see through me as I lose control
Can you feel it?
I got love, son, ooh, can you feel it?
I'm a shooting star, you're a honeybee
Buzzing'round my heart'til you can't see me
Can you feel it?
I got love, son, ooh, can you feel it?
Will you make me whole?
Will you touch me in my soul?
Will you make me whole?
You touch me in my soul
And I don't care if my heart has gone
And I don't care if I'm all alone
I'm lost, oh
Get me wrong, ooh, I'm lost, oh
And I don't mind if my body's aching
I don't mind that I'm trembling and shaking
In a love song
And I don't mind at all
Ooh ooh yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
The love song makes me strong
Ooh ooh yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
Your love song makes me strong
You're buzzing through the air on your flowered shirts
Like a sacred calling ending up in church
Can you feel it?
Like a love song
Can you feel it?
I don't know where my love has gone
But I got stung and I can't go on
Can you feel it?
I got stung, yeah, can you feel it?
Will you make me whole?
Will you touch me in my soul?
Will you make me whole?
Will you touch me in my soul?
And I don't care where my heart has gone
And I don't care if I'm overload
I'm lost on
Can't be wrong, ooh, I'm lost on
And I don't mind if my body is aching
And I don't mind if I'm trembling and shaking
I'm lost on
And I don't mind at all
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Your love song makes me strong
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Your love song makes me strong
