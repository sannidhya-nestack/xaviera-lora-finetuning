Won't it be great, lovin' a girl like you
To never be lonely through all those dark, starless nights
Never goin' back, these are the best of times
We're laughin' in backwards rhymes and it all feels so new
With a girl like you
Let's just go to Paris
I don't think we'll ever come back to dodge
Not with a girl like you
What have we got to lose?
I figure it's time for moving on
There's never enough loving a girl like you
Every day ends too soon when you're not mine tonight
Not gonna stop'til we're lovers and best of friends
With feelings we can't extend'til we're life just for two
With a girl like you
Let's just go to Paris
I don't think we'll ever come back to dodge
Not with a girl like you
With a girl like you
What have we got to lose?
I figure it's time for moving on
Wheels turn into wings in a red velvet sky as we
Confess our secrets all the way
Everything, oh anything
Breathe in shadows'til the day
Won't it be great, loving a girl like you
To never be lonely through all those dark, starless nights
With a girl like you
Let's just go to Paris
I don't think we'll ever come back to dodge
Not with a girl like you
Girl, what have we got to lose?
I figure it's time for moving on
