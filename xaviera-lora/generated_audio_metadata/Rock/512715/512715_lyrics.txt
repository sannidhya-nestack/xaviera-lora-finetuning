So tell me, tell me this time it is you
Because of everything you do
Baby, the whole world is ours to choose
And there's nothing we could lose
And maybe, maybe next year I'll have seen
All the things that we could've been
Sometimes I wonder how much I would hate
Of myself if I lived your dreams
And now I realize
We are all just stars falling from the sky
We've come so far to be where we are
We are all just stars cutting broken hearts to another part
This is who we are
I have to know the goodness in your life
So I can fall into your eyes
And if there's only one thing I can try
It's for you every time
And now I see how much you mean to me
Baby you were everything I dreamed
I'd swim into the darkness of the sea
For a chance to have you and me
And now I
Real life
We are all just stars
Falling from the sky
We've come so far
To be where we are
We are all just stars
Cutting broken hearts to another part
This is who we are
We are all stars
We are all stars
We are all just stars falling from the sky
We've come so far to be where we are
We are all just stars guiding broken hearts to another part
This is who we are
This is who we are! This is who we are! This is who we are! This is who we are!
