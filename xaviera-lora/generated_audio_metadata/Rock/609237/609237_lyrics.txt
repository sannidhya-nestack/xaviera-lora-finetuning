I fly like a butterfly
I fly through the wild
I fly like a butterfly
I fly through the wild
Way up high
In a blue blue sky
I fly like a millionaire
But I ain't got no shoes
I fly like a millionaire
But I ain't got no shoes
I open my wings
Get a butterfly blues
I fly like a butterfly, I fly through the wild
I fly like a butterfly, I fly through the wild
I hope on my wings, in the blue blue sky
Fly fly fly like a butterfly
Fly fly fly like a butterfly
Fly fly fly like a butterfly
Got nothing to lose
Got a butterfly blues
