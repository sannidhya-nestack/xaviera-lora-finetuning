Heavenly flow
See I live in the cloud
Light and clear
Without any bow
If you speak low
It will go so high
Will you hear that wonderful sound
Spreading the wings again
Feeling the wind and knowing I am falling
I am flying away
I am ready
All my life's a race
I run it in my head
I am flying away
But remember
You are my best friend
Whoever told you
He can measure the sky
And your past affects your tomorrow
Whoever told you that one day I will die
Don't believe it, I'll stay in your sorrow
Spreading the wings again
Feeling the wind and knowing I am falling
I am sliding away
I am crazy, all my life's a race
I'm running in my head
I am flying away
But remember
You are my best friend
I'm not afraid to lose my way
I'm not afraid of what they say
Only fear I have is burning out my heart
Fear of falling in love
You know, I'll see you there, in heaven
Even if I leave, baby, I'll think of you
I am flying away
I am ready
All my life's in the race
I'm running in my head
I am flying away
But remember
You are my best friend
