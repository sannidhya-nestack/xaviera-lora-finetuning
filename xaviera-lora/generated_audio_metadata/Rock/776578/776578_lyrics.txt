Come with me and I'll show you what the world can be
All my heart is waiting to be free
And I'll never let nobody else know what's deep inside
In the air there's an answer and it's ringing clear
Endless room for someone else to share
I've got everything to show you and nothing left to hide
Fly away
Yeah the world is so small as we look down below
All I'll say
If together we fall then together we grow
Ooh, ooh
Take a ride
Lift and hide your baby at my side
Let the feeling take control so right
You're the only one who knows how to touch me deep inside
Yeah you touch me deep inside
Fly away
Yeah, the world is so small as we look down below
I'll stay
If together we fall, then together we'll grow
When I look in your eyes, that's all I need to know
You can get what you want
You can get what you need
And you'll learn that the best in life is free
Baby come take my hand
You and I understand
Yeah we'll still be above
Yeah we'll still fly
When we land
Fly
Yeah, the world is so small as we look down below
And I'll always stay
If together we fall, then together we'll go flying away
Yeah, the world is so small as we look down below
All I'll say is together we fall and together we'll grow
When I look in your eyes that's all I need to know
