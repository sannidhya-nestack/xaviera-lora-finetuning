Lemonade in your hand, foam swim
Brand new day, it's some goddamn warm fit
Preacher man, shaking hands
Faint grin
Drown yourself in the bathtub
Down with the Baptist
Born again
Lemonade
From the sand
In your hand
Now your wife won't worry where you've been last night
Stayin' up is a pastime
Brother Wilson, where are you?
Eliminate, congregate, patient pain
Could've stayed
Can't live this way
Bad again
Wrap your arms with the laundry
Cross fixed on your body
Gone away
Lemonade, masquerade, you're done for now
Now your wife won't worry where you've been last night
Stayin' up is a pastime
But whoever could say yes
(Let's get it on, I'm out of here, I'm ready, let me in, I'm out of here, I'm ready, let me in, I'm out of here, I'm ready, let me in, I'm out of here, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in, I'm ready, let me in.
