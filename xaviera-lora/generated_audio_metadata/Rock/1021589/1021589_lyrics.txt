Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I'm wasting all this time and I'm losing focus
I go to play this old song but the record's broken
So I've been waiting by this door but it's never open
I know I'm preaching to the choir but you need to notice
Everything, everything is alright
It's alright (I keep telling myself) to let go (let you see)
That everything, everything is alright (I keep telling myself)
It's alright (I keep telling myself) to let go (let you see)
Gotta keep these eyes wide open
Gotta keep these pockets growin'
It's hard to sleep with all this pride
But at least I'm copin'
Sick of all the stoppin' goin'
Sick of all the never knowin'
I wanna throw it all away in the deepest ocean
Everything, everything is alright
It's alright
I keep telling myself to let go
Everything, everything is alright
I keep telling myself it's alright
Keep telling myself to let go
They better let you see
They better let you see
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Can't you see everything, everything is alright
