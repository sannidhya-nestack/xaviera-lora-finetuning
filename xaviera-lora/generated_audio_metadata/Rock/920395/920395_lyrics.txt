Oceans, the night that we lost the world
Anxious, pressing a blooming girl
It floods my mind, it haunts me
Dreaming of everything life could be
The risk, you bet everything on me
And here we are
No regrets tonight, baby, I'd do it all again
Every good thing, every pain, all for love
Even in the night there is power in the light
And we fight to make it right all for love
Some days it took all we had to rise above brokenness in our lives
We had our doubts heavy still love was changing us every year
Our hearts learning to fight the fear and here we are
No regrets tonight, baby
I'd do it all again
Every good thing, every pain
All for love
And even in the night
There is power in the light
And we fight to make it right
All for love
I'm not running, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not worried, I'm not the same anymore
I'm not finished, I know the power of love
No regrets tonight
Baby, I'd do it all again
Every good thing, every pain
All for love
There is power in the light
And we fight to make it right
All for love
I'm not running, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not worried, I'm not the same anymore
I'm not finished, I know the power of love
Stay with me, stay with me, baby
Stay with me tonight, lover
Stay with me, stay with me, all for love
Stay with me, stay with me, baby
Stay with me tonight, lover
Stay with me, stay with me, all for love
All for love
All for love
All for love
