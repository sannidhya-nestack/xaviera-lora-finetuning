I'm sitting here looking at your picture
It all comes rushing back
The perfect life I thought would last forever
Was over just like that
I'm not saying I'm not to blame
But it hurts like hell anyway
The love we had was yours to save
But you turned your back and walked away
Next time that I fall, I'll fall
For someone who's not like you were
The last one you broke
You broke my heart in two
I met a girl but I won't call her
I'm thinking what's the use
That's the way it's been this whole damn winter
Every girl reminds me of you, me of you
Well the next time that I fall
I'll fall for someone who's not like you were
The last one, you broke, you broke my heart in two words, it's over
You broke, you broke my heart in two
How can I find a way to be okay
To take away the pain
How can I take away the pain
The next time that I fall, I fall
For someone who's not like you were
The last one, you broke, you broke my heart
In two words, it's over
It's over, yeah
My heart in two words
It's over, it's over, yeah
In two words
