Make good mine
Or use the time
I love you, I wanna be with you
I raise my eyes
My mind defines what it is
Or what it is
And for me, my beloved, I am weak
Waking in the dark
Like a future ideal, reinventing the wheel to feel, oh
And in the fields the sun comes through
Giving in my jails of you, I'll
And in the graves I will lay down
The burdens that enslave me on higher ground
Enfold me my beloved I am weak
Waking in the dark
Of ecstasy, I'm easy, like a future ideal
Reinventing the wheel to feel, oh
Let's just have fun, fun, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's just have the good, the good, the good time, ah, ah
When I was young, I felt it strong
I felt it carry me along
And in the war, I hear the fall
I knew there has got to be something more
And for me, my beloved, I am weak
Waking in the dark
Of ecstasy on ears, yeah
Like a future ideal
Reinventing the wheel to feel, ah
Reinventing the wheel to fear
To feel, to feel, to feel
To feel, to feel, to feel
