Now I'm finding myself looking right over there
The lights are bright they're blinding my stare
All I ever wanted was to see you
To feel your presence again
I know it's not the end
I won't fall
I won't stumble
I'll find a way to open your heart
And live again
I give my all, it's not your fault
I'll break it all down and start at the beginning, beginning
I refuse to believe what was happening to me
All the years and suffering returned
All I ever saw was someone helpless
Afraid of what's undone
I can no longer run, I won't fall
I won't stumble
I'll find a way to open your heart and live again
I give my all, it's not your fault
I'll break it all down and start at the beginning
I know a safe place where you can hide
But it won't be for long
I never knew it could get so dark
Until you found love once more
I won't fall, I won't stumble
Find a way to your heart
I give my all, it's not your fault
I'll break it all down and start at the beginning
Heaven and hell
