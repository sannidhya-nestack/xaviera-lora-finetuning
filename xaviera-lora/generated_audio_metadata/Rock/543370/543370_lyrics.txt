I feel like I'm drowning
In a pool of my own blood, sweat and tears
And it hurts to see that life's bubble
And it hurts to close my eyes one last time
I'm gonna miss the way you smile at me when I look at you
I'm gonna miss you, it does not matter how far you are
I'm gonna miss the way you are
And I
I feel like I'm falling
But I just can't see the ground
And it hurts to know that I'm not stopping
And it hurts to close my eyes one last time
I'm gonna miss the way you smile at me when I look at you
I'm gonna miss the way you laugh
I'm gonna miss you it does not matter how far you are
I'm gonna miss the way you are
Yeah, yeah
You'll be just fine without me
You'll be just fine without me
You'll be just fine without me
Yeah, you'll be fine without me
