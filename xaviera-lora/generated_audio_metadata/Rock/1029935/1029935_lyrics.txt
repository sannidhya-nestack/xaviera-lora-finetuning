Your words like daggers in my heart
You don't know just what they could start
Sometimes you're better off when it's unspoken, unbroken
Everything yesterday I said
The things I'd wish and you were dead
I knew that once I said and I et it
I regret it
So should I stay?
Should I know
I have to say what's the point
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
Why do I say the things I do?
Am I just crazy, just IQ?
We're pieces of a puzzle that aren't fitting
I'm not kidding
It's happened again just today
My thoughtless words won't go away
It doesn't make much sense and I am puzzled
But not muzzled
So should I stay?
Should I know?
I have to say what's the point
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
We can bounce back
