Man, I need a road trip, uh
Do-do-do-do, uh
Do do do do
Well I see people talking
But I can't hear a sound
And I don't know just what they're saying
But I know word gets around
So I don't care to listen
Because I'm leaving anyway
And I just want them all to know
I'm leaving today
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I've been down a lonely road
Feel like moving on, baby
But I hope that you realize
The things you've done wrong
I don't want your money
No, I said I don't want your time
I just wanna be free
I'm gonna live without you, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, oh
Do-da-da-do, uh
Do-da-da-do
Well everybody told me
That you weren't worth a damn
So if I passed you on my street
You know I would not shake your lousy hand
I'm just tired of wasting my time
I'm gonna take my stand
You had your chance to be with me
But you took her instead
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I've been down the lonely road
Feel like moving on baby
But I hope that you realize
The things you done wrong
I don't want your money
No, I said I don't want your time
I just wanna be free
I'm gonna live without you, yeah
Lord, I'm coming down
I feel like moving on
Got to head toward the sun
the sun is my time and time is no more
I think I've come undone
This dried me out, so give me some more
Give me some more, yeah
Ha ha ha do do do do uh
Do do do do uh
Do do do do
Well, I can't wait to see you and the look on your face
When you find that I've been gone to a much better place
You know I'm gonna start laughing when you come knocking on my door
I wonder how long it's gonna take'til you come back for more
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lord, I'm coming down
I feel like moving on
Got to head toward the sun
the sun is my time and time is no more
I think I've come undone
