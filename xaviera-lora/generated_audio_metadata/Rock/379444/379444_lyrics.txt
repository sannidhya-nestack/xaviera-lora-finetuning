She breaks your heart in a second
It'll take a blink of an eye
And then she melts'cause she's able
With a simple thing as a smile
She knows she can'cause she's lovely
And I know for sure that deep down
She knows she is a star
She'll get you mad, but you'll settle for it
Once you see those sexy eyes
Pretty brown, like from heaven sent
There's a devil in disguise
She's prone, she knows that I'm handsome, lovely
And I think she knows that deep down she's as hot as a fire
Burned completely, oh, you don't even feel
The flames of her smile, she's indescribable
Some might even say, innocent like a child
You might get fooled, you know, and no doubt you'll say
Her intentions are nice
And no matter what she does, you'll say she's
Primarily loving you, yeah
She'll tell her friends that you're eating out of the palm of her hands
And it's no lie even though she don't want that to be said
It's typical beauty and the beast and the beauty gets her way
You hear a song on the radio
Self esteem it rings a bell
But all it does is make you sing along
Cause like the fool I say you fail
It's who you have, it's sensational
And you need to feel that warm sensation when she's around
You don't even feel the flames of her smile, she's indescribable
Some might even say, innocent like a child
You might get fooled you know, and all doubt you'll say
Her intentions are nice, and don't matter what
She does, you say she's primary loving alien (Primary evil)
You say you cannot change your mind
You say yes for everything hurts for all time
You try to be all that you can for that smile
Need not to convince that you're hypnotized
You just get burned completely oh
You don't even feel the flames of her smile
She's indescribable
Some might even say innocent like a child
You did get fooled you know
And all dogs will say her intentions are nice
And no matter what she does you'll say she's primarily loving you yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
