What shrouds of time flow through my mind
What aimless wandering
What sense of past refuse to fade
What future does it bring
Whose kiss of death for love of hope sleeps on my windowsill
Dredging up those mortal sins all wrapped in whipple wheels
I can sense the past sniffing future's pride
Thought dormant all these years but now still found alive
The years we breathed now turned a foul
A skunk gang nasal scent
So I wander day and night through dreams less elegant
Through dreams less elegant
What of this maid who flaunts her wares
Demanding all to watch
Thinking her great mystery lies beyond her crotch
And as she dips her universe
A sudden thrill gives rise to run beyond those she can't hide
I can sense the past, nipping future's pride
Thought golden all these years but now still found the light
The air she breathed now turned a foul, a skulking nasal synth
So I wander day and night through dreams less elegant
Through dreams less elegant
Some days quite lost with rack of fear
Some nights beyond the pale
Dredging up those mortal sins
All wrapped and whip away
I can sense the past nipping future's pride
Thought dormant all these years but now still found alive
The years sweep, breath now turned all foul
A skulking nasal scent
So I wander day and night
Rude dreams, less elegance
Rude dreams, less elegance
Rude dreams, less elegance
Dreams, less elegance
Less elegance
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
