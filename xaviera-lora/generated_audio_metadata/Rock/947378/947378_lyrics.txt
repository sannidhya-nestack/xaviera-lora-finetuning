I know that you're thinking about me
I know that you're dreaming about me
Spinning like a planet around me, around me
I'm a F-L-A-M-E
I know that you hate me, you hate me
But it don't you envy, envy me
Wanna be in my place, in my skin, my skin
I'm a Q-U-E-M-E
You think that we are same, but made the same mistake
Don't waste my time and I get lost, you don't wanna see who's the best
Oh baby, you have a pretty face, a pretty face, oh
Don't cock your nose and know your place, know your place
You won't get every letter you ask
Not even close, you're just a wannabe around me
A pretty wannabe, a shallow wannabe
When you come around, and you come around
You look so awkward and embarrassing now
You never steal my drive, you never copy me
I only copy R-O-G-H-T
I live in a spotlight, in a spotlight
I'm so bright as the post, I shine in the night
I don't need no mic, I don't need no guitars
But I rock,'cause I'm alive, my C-A-R
You think that we are same, but babe, that's a mistake
Don't waste my time, better get lost
You don't wanna see who's the boss
Oh, baby, you have a pretty face, a pretty face, oh
Don't cock your nose and know your place, know your place
You won't get ever lover
You are not even close, you're just a wannabe
Around me, a pretty wannabe, a shallow wannabe
Oh, baby, you have a pretty face, a pretty face, oh
Don't cock your nose, I know your place, know your place
You won't get every level
You are not even close to just a wannabe
But when you see a pretty wannabe
I say, "I wanna be your wannabe," yeah
Hey, hey, ho
