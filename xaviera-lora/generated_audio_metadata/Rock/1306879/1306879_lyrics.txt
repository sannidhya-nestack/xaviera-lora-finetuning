I just got in and it's Friday night
Workin' all week and I'm wind up tired
Whoa, whoa
I gotta get loose, gotta get my kicks
Shake a leg and dance like a lunatic
Whoa, whoa
Woah, and you know that it's right by the way it makes you feel
And you know that it's right when it's real
Get up, let's go crazy
The dance floor is calling out your name
Get up
Let's go crazy
Get those hands up let me hear you sing
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Way oh way oh way oh way oh way over
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Way oh way oh way oh way oh way over
Mary Ann said, "Have you seen my friend? She's a stone cold eleven on a scale of ten"
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Top black dress, bright red lips
Baby, can you show me how you move those hips?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And you know that it's right by the way it makes you feel
And you know that it's right when you know that it's real
And tonight, girl, tonight, yeah, it's real
Get up, let's go crazy
The dance floor is calling out our name
Come on let's go crazy (let's go crazy)
Get those hands up let me hear you sing
Come on let's go (do do do do do do do do do do do)
Come on let's go (we oh we oh we oh we oh we oh)
