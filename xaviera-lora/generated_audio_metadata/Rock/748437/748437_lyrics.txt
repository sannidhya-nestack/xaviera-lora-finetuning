Friends say you're crazy and they can't help wonder what it is I see in you
Is it the dimple on your chin? If not then maybe it's your baby blues
They say you're from the wrong side of town
That's their excuse to put you down
They may be right, you're wrong for me but baby you're the right kind of wrong
Hey baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Right here with me is where you belong
They mystified me getting along
You're the right kind of wrong
I wouldn't be surprised if they're just jealous of the chemistry we share
I'm always happy just to spend my day with you and simply breathe your air
But when you go away it's tough
I start to think I made you up
They may be right, you're wrong for me
But baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Hey baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Right here with me is where you belong
They're mystified, they're getting along
You're the right kind of wrong
Guess I need to just come clean
And tell them what you mean to me
They may be right, you're wrong for me
But baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Hey baby you're the right kind of wrong
Right here with me is where you belong
They're mystified we getting along
You're the right kind of wrong
It's been like never since I got to feeling this way about anyone
But it's so hard to get together
It's like I'm the moon and you're the sun
It's written on the wind and the stars
I need to be wherever you are
They may be right, you're wrong for me
But baby, you're the right kind of wrong
They may be right, you're wrong for me
But baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Hey baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Right here with me is where you belong
They're mystified, we getting along
You're the right kind of wrong
Hey baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Right here with me is where you belong
They're mystified, we getting along
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
You're the right kind of wrong
