There's something about the way you smile
There's something about the way you are
Maybe I've been lost for quite a while
One long lonely night without a star
If I keep you to myself
You're not there, you're not there
Can't keep sunshine on a shelf
It's everywhere, it's everywhere, yeah yeah
There's something about the way you love me
Helps me recognize I need to grow
Though I've barely won a single trophy
Now I radiate the winning glow
Left my childish ways behind
It's all brand new, it's all brand new
Happiness seemed hard to find
But it finds you, it finds you
If I keep you to myself
You're not there, you're not there
Can't keep sunshine on our shelf
It's everywhere, it's everywhere, yeah, yeah
Everywhere
Can't keep sunshine on the shelf, it's everywhere, it's everywhere
Can't keep sunshine on the shelf, it's everywhere
