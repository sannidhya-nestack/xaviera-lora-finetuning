I saw you slipping away from me
Was it something that you found that I just can't see
You're all with it, think you've seen the world
But you'll find there's something more to this hometown girl
So stay with me, I'll stay with you
For the experience, the experience
So stay with me, I'll stay with you
For the experience, the experience
It's been arranged, we leave tonight
You need the evidence, then check the flight
We'll get you in rhythm, we'll get it right
Or we'll fight, or we'll fight, then we'll turn out the light
So stay with me, I'll stay with you
For the experience, the experience
So stay with me, I'll stay with you
For the experience, the experience
So a little bit of love (a little bit of love)
A little more pain (a little more pain)
For the experience, the experience
So a little bit of love (a little bit of love)
A little more pain (a little more pain)
For the experience, the experience
All my life I played it safe
And you had another idea for making
Every moment new and so insane
Are you ready? I'm ready
Are you ready? I'm ready
So stay with me (stay with me)
I'll stay with you (I'll stay with you)
For the experience, the experience
So stay with me (stay with me)
I'll stay with you (I'll stay with you)
For the experience, the experience
A little bit of love (a little bit of love)
A little more pain (a little more pain)
For the experience, the experience
A little bit of love, a little more pain
For the experience, the experience
La la la la la la la la la la la
For the experience, the experience
La la la la la la la la la la
For the experience, the experience
A little bit of love, a little more pain
For the experience, the experience
A little bit of love, a little more pain
For the experience, the experience
