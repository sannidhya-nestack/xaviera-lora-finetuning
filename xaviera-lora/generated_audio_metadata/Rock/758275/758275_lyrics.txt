Clap your hands and feel the beat
Shake your hips and move your feet
Let the rhythm take control
Let your body move, let it go
It doesn't matter if there's no one rockin'
You gotta dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watching
It doesn't matter if there's no one rocking
You gotta dance like there's nobody watching
Do the chicken or the moonwalk
Make it funky or let it rock
Throw your hands up in the air
Or do the limbo like I care
All I want is to see the body rocking
So dance like there's nobody watching
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
It doesn't matter if there's no one rockin'
You gotta dance like there's nobody watchin'
Uh oh uh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Do the mashed potato
Do the bunny hop
Do the freaking hollow shake
Or just boggle like a punk rock
We just starting so why you stopping
You gotta dance like there's nobody watching
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
Dance like there's nobody watchin'
It doesn't matter if there's no one rockin'
You gotta dance like there's nobody watchin'
