Satellites in love, satellites in love, oh
Whenever the wind blows through your hair
I can feel magic in the air
And I know, I know
The world will stop and stare, oh oh
The scent of spring is what you wear
It makes me follow you anywhere
And you don't, you don't know
You dance through life with flair
And every time I touch your hand
It's like Columbus finds Newland
To conquer, I wonder if I ever comprehend
How it seems to be unfair that it's not about truth or dare
That I can hold you, can hold you and kiss you everywhere
we are satellites in love
We're floating'round the world at night, oh
We are satellites in love
Reflecting each other's inner light
Just shining like the moon in love
Oh, oh, oh
Satellites in love
Oh, oh, oh
When you smile it's like a flower
It makes me radiant for an hour
And you know, you know
I feel courageous like Jack Bauer
Oh yeah
There's no greater good on earth
To feel your love be cross rebirth
And I know, I know
No gold will have its worth
And every time I touch your hand
Like Columbus finds new land
To conquer and wonder if I ever comprehend
How it seems to be unfair
That it's not about truth or dare
That I can hold you, can hold you
And kiss you everywhere
we are satellites in love
We're floating'round the world at night, oh
We are satellites in love
Reflecting each other's inner light
Just shining like the moon in love
Oh, satellites in love, oh
'Cause the two of us together
Can transform mind over matter
Through this rush that lasts forever
Oh yeah
In this trendy kind of glamour
We're like kids like McGregor
And we'll wander around forever
Satellites in love
Satellites in love
Oh yeah, yeah
In love
Satellites in love
Oh oh oh oh
We are satellites
In love
Satellites in love
Satellites in love
We are satellites
In love
Satellites in love
Oh oh oh oh
We are satellites
