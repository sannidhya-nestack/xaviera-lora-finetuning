Walk a mile in my shoes, spend the night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you, walk a mile in my shoes
I'd trade places with you any day, you wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue about what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile in my shoes
Downtown there's a ragged man
Getting by the best he can
Says he just needs a helping hand
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'm hurting here can't you see
I need a drink, not your sympathy
Before you look down your nose at me
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spend the night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'd drag places with you any day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue'bout what I've been through
Walk the mile, walk the mile, walk the mile
In my shoes
Mmm, uptown there's a pretty girl
Big house, nice car and pearls
Says before you covered my world
Walk a mile in my shoes
My husband barely comes home
I'm left here all alone
With two kids I raised on my own
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spend the night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'd trade places with you any day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue about what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile
In my shoes
Gucci Skechers, Prada flip flops
Don't matter which ones you wear
Jimmy June, Nike, Tonalama, Birkenstocks
Troubles coming everywhere
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spend the night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'd trade places with you any day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue about what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile
In my shoes
