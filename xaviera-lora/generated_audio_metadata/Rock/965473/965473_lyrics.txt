You got to be who you are today
There ain't any other way
Who cares what people say
You got to be who you are
If you want your light to shine
Night and day, all the time
Be yourself and you will find
It's good to be who you are
Nobody's gonna look like you
Nobody's gonna have your style
Nobody's gonna walk your walk
Nobody's gonna have your smile
Don't you change for someone
They won't want who you become
Anytime your heart grows young
You've got to be who you are
Start believing in all the things they say
And it's assured you're gonna lose your way
Nobody's gonna look like you
Nobody's gonna have your style
Nobody's gonna walk your walk
Nobody's gonna have your smile
Baby somebody set you free
So you can find your love
Go while you are young
Go be who you are
Go while you are young
Go be who you are
