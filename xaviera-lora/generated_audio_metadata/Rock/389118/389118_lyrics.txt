She's beside and far away
I've been making plans today
Plans to work and pay the rent
It's amazing how the time gets spent
She could say a word or two
I might even hear it
She could say I'm leaving you
I could say whatever did I do
She's the lover of my dreams
Dreams I used to have and save her
But now the real thing is achieved
I am only wishing that I was more alone
You don't get anything for free
And if you ever hope to keep it
The only freedom you get easily is the freedom to abuse it
And if your saddle is your guilt
Then your mount is cannon fodder
And I hate to be the dead horse that I
Should have led the water
She's doing what she does, I'm being what I was
I'm hoping for a chance, you know sometimes I feel I never really
Get a chance
I'm lying at her feet, begging her to never leave
And as she packs her things, I realize the begging was a dream
I never told her one damn thing
I'm gonna break my heart
But never break the cycle
All I want's a taste of water from the good life
All I want is easy love
And I am reaching through my handcuffs
I am holding out my hands,'cause
But I never get my hands up to my mouth in time
The water always slips right through my fingers
