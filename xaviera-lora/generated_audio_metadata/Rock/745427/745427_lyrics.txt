I will sparkle like diamonds when you're on top of the world
I will paint the sky for you, sure, purple and red
How are you today
And thank you for that smile
Been a long time
Haven't felt genuine in a while
How did you know now
Just want to say
Happiness is real
I'm learning to play
I will spark like diamonds when you're on top of the world
I will paint the sky a fusion of purple and red
I'll live by my own desires, feel me instead
No more war in the world, only peace and love
Ring across the lenses
What was that you said
And where do you come off
Making me feel so bad
My tongue's all tied in knots, knots, knots
How did you know now?
Just what to say
Happiness is real
I like it that way
I will spark like diamonds
We're on top of the world
I will paint the sky blue or shallow
Purple and red
I'll live by my own desires
Feel me instead
No more war in the world
Let peace and love
Something's waiting for us right around the bend
Flowers unfolding, my heart's on the mend
Now I see just what you're doing for me
My happy day friend
Happy day, friend
I will spark like diamonds
When you're on top of the world
I will paint the sky for you, sure
Purple and red
I live by my own desires
Feel me instead
No more war in the world
No more war in the world
No more war in my world
Let peace and love
Let peace and love
Let peace and love
Rain across the
Land
