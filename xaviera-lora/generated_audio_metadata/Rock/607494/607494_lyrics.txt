I don't need your hairdos
Don't need a love use
Get it away from me
Get it away from me
Don't need commitment
I don't need resentment
Just get it away from me
Get it away
Cause this game is nothing new
It did not start with you
And everyone's watching
So we'll give'em a show
And everyone's sayin' that we're perfect, you know
But everyone's not, but not you and me
It's gettin' too heavy, now get away from me
I don't need the drama, you're not a queen
Just get it away from me, get it away from me
I don't want your problems, I'm not your fix
Just get it away from me, get it away
this game is nothing new
It did not start with you
And everyone's watching, so we'll give'em a show
And everyone's saying that we're perfect, you know
But everyone's not, but not you and me
It's getting too heavy, now get away from me
I know this is hard
But I just don't want to break your heart
I wish you could see
That it's not you, it's all me
And everyone's watching
So let's give'em a show
And everyone's saying that we're perfect, you know
But everyone's not
They're not you and me
It's getting too heavy
Y'all can't away from me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
