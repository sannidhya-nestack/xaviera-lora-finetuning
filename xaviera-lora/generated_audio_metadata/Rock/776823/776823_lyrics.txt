Maybe someday I'll miss you, I do not know
I'm finally moving on forward again, back in control
there's no time to be living, back in the past
In a time when we felt so sure, this love would last
But these nights have been so restless
The memories start helpless fire
It's tearing apart my soul now
Burn it down, burn it to the ground
I don't wanna see you there
Not its race, not the lips or face
I don't wanna even care
Maybe someday I'll leave you out of my heart
I never knew you were hiding below the deepest bar
And if I stand on my feet now and walk away
Would I find all my freedom, baby, or would you stay?
these nights have been so restless
The memories start helpless, but it's tearing apart my soul now
Burn it down, burn it to the ground
I don't wanna see you there
Not a trace, nothing left to face'Cause I don't wanna even care, yeah
All I see, all I see in my dreams Are your eyes, they won't go away
So I lie and I lie and I cry Hoping one day I will be saved
And all these nights would fade away
I'd throw them out like wasted dreams
Give me the strength so I can face a new day
Burn it down, burn it to the ground
I don't wanna see you there
Not a trace, nothing left to face
I don't wanna even care
But burn it down, burn it to the ground
I don't wanna see you there
Not a trace, nothing left to face
I don't wanna even care, yeah yeah
Baby someday I'll miss you (someday I'll miss you) I do not know (I do not know)
Baby someday I'll miss you (maybe someday I'll miss you) I do not know (i do not know)
Baby someday I'll miss you (maybe someday I'll miss you) I do not know (i do not know)
Maybe someday I'll miss you (maybe someday)
