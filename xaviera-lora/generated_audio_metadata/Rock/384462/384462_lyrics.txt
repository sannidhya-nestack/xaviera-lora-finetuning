You don't know what it's like to be so poor
Girl, this life isn't fun at all
Imagine eating in a lavish garden
Imagine living the life of luxury
Imagine seeing the diamonds go off my hands
Go off my hands
Surprise surprise we ain't children anymore
Where I'm grown up and gladdened on the door
Imagine eating a lavish starter
Imagine living the life of a trap
Imagine seeing the diamonds falling off of my hands
Falling off of my hands
That's why all the minds
They don't know what it's like to be removed
And your reason just ain't welcome here no more
Imagine eating a lavish tartare
Imagine living a life on a block strike
Imagine seeing a timeless ball and all fall by our hands
All fall by our hands
Imagine eating a lavish garden
Imagine living the life of love's wrath
Imagine seeing the diamonds glow
All glow off of my hands
Glowing off of my hands
Glowing off of my hands
Go off of my head
Go off of my head
