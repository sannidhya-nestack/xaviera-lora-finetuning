Broken down car, won't get very far
It's alright'cause we like it here
Shut down the trains, no fuel for the planes
It's alright'cause we like it here
I'm the fool, I'm the fool
I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl
You are my world
I'm the fool, I'm the fool
I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl
Turn off the phone
Pretend we're alone
All we need is right here in our hands
Lock the front door
And if we get bored
All we need is right here in our hands
I'm the fool, I'm the fool
I've always been for you
You're the girl
You're the girl, you own my world
I'm the fool, I'm the fool
I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl
Oh, I'm the fool, oh yeah
I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl
You are my world
I'm the fool, such a fool
I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl
Yeah, yeah
I'm the fool, I'm the fool, I've always been for you
You're the girl, you're the girl (I'm the fool)
I'm the fool, I'm the fool, i've always been for you, for you
You are my world, my world, you
You are my world, my world, yeah, yeah, yeah
