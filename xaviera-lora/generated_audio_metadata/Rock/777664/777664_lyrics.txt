Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, oh, ooh
Friday night my girls are all inside
I see the flashing lights
My heartbeat pounds
A knotted hands break
As I'm head first through the door
etting about the times before
Dancing, laughing, then I spy
A set up, fed up face passed by
Baby please don't go
You're taking my heart with you
It's walking right through the dark
If only you could know
I'd give this all away for us to be alone
Crash the door down, spit out on the street
I see you with a girl
Wanna push delete
Then it hit me
Like a ton of bricks
Tell me it's something I can fix
Crying, trying, lying
Like the past, but now it's me who wants you back
Baby please don't go, you're taking my heart with you
It's walking right through the door
If only you could know
How to give this all away
For us to be alone
You say it's a routine
Draining every inch of me
And right now it's got to end
Let's get back in the car
I'll miss the warmth around your arms
And I'll never leave you again
So baby please don't go, you're taking my heart with you, it's walking right through the door
If only you could know
I'd give this all away
For us to be alone
Tell you now
It's how it's gonna be
I'll never leave the grass and smile
You're moonlit as the dark when you're with me
If only you could know
I'd give this all away for us to be alone
I'd give this all away for us to be alone
I'm taking my heart with you
So baby please don't go
