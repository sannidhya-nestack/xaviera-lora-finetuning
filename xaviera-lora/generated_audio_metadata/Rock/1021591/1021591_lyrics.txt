There's a venom in me
It's hard to sleep
When I think it's over now
It knocks me off my feet
Hey, it's the chemical rising
I'm all over me now
Hey, it's the chemical rising
I'm all over me now
I'm looking for a portion of something that will kill these dreams
And I'm hanging on an ocean that maybe you can wallow in me
And I'm hoping I can get back, back to a time before this
But this venom keeps rising, oh this venom keeps rising
It's the chemical rising, all over me now (it's rising)
It's the chemical rising, all over me now, hey
It's the chemical rising, all over me now hey
It's the chemical rising
It's a chemical arising
There is nothing I can do but swear this sound
Swear this sound
There is nothing I can do but swear this sound
Swear this sound
It's the chemical rising, all over me now
It's the chemical rising, all over me now (hey)
It's the chemical rising, all over me now
It's the chemical rising, it's the chemical rising (then, then, then, then)
