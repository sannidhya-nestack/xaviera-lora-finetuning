You got something to say, just let it out
Don't be afraid, you got nothing to lose
Except everything and everyone
Ever thought it could be, take a look around
Tell me what do you see, always blind to the truth
Have you figured out that I'm just like you
Why do we always run away from all of these things that we really need to say?
And it's a long and lonely road that you've been walking down
And if you're ready for a change then I can show you how
We could find a way, get it figured out
It'll be okay, in the moment of truth
Do you see in yourself, what I see in you?
You got something to say, yeah
Just let it out, never be afraid
Got nothing to lose
Have you figured out, that I'm just like you
Why do we always run away
From all of these things
That we really need to say
And it's a long and lonely road
That you've been walking down
And if you're ready for a change
Then I can show you how
We could change the world if we choose to now
We could change the world
I can tell now by the look on your face
There's nothing more that I could say, yeah
Nothing could change that
You're waiting for something or someone to save the day
I can't take this, not anymore
I don't need this, I'm for sure
Why would you say that? Why don't you take this away?
You got something to say, just let it out, don't be afraid
'Cause it's a long and lonely road
That you've been walking down
And if you're ready for a change
Then I can show you how
We can change the world
If we choose to now
We can change the world
We could change the world
If we choose to, yeah
We could change the world
