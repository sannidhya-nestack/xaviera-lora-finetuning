Gravity is wearing thin
Yet I still walk
Inebriation setting in
But I can still talk
There's a light inside, I swear
And I must stand tall
Against the world, I'm on my own
Whoa
Saying goodbye
I can hear them say, that everything inside is all a lie
Just to get their own way, say goodbye
A price too high to pay, there comes a time you know inside
You won't stand for the charade, so just walk away
Never realized till now this false visage
Just how long can I afford this self-sabotage?
There's a line inside I swear
And I must stand tall against the world and here I stand
Whoa, say goodbye
I can hear them say that everything inside is all a lie
Just to get their own way
Say goodbye
A price too high to pay
There comes a time you know inside you won't stand for the charades so just walk away
All my life, I knew there'd come a time for me to say goodbye
Say goodbye
I can hear them say
That everything inside is all a lie
Just to get their own way
Say goodbye
A price too high to pay
There comes a time you know inside
There's only one thing left to say
Goodbye
