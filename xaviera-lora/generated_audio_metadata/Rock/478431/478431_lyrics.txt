The day begins
What does the future hold, will reveal today
Games we like to play, nothing fails
Ticking of the clocks, better days and nights
Come along the way
I always wanted to get it right
My precious thing
Please don't ask me why
Please don't tell me why
Please don't complicate
Very simple things
Why you tell me lies
You make me blue
You make me sad about you
Why you don't realize
You make me blue
You make me mad about you
About you
The night is young, it's sad but always true
Who could ever know we will get this far
Disappointments, life of separate lives
And one day you'll see they will collide
I always wanted to get it right, my precious thing
Please don't ask me why
Please don't tell me why
Please don't complicate very simple things
Why you tell me lies
You make me blue, you make me sad about you
Why you don't realize?
You make me blue, you make me mad about you
No matter what happens to me (no matter what happens to me)
I'll always ask you one thing
Why you tell me lies
You make me blue
You make me sad about you
Why you don't realize
You make me blue
You make me mad about you
About you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-la
