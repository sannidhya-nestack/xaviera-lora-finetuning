Creep me alive
As I sigh until your corpse is white
Get it up and gas
Wait till you've re-washed mine
Ready for attack
Made a thing of self to deceive
Always on the run
Hiding from the alien race
Run
Best you can hide
Out of sight and mind
The aliens will live
With a soul 12, you have no mastermind, the mind is blind
One abomination, souls of black, you should pass this way
Path next time, you'll have decayed
Eyes full of black, how did you even set free?
Four tears in your eyes, quick kill
Time fails, you should pass this way
Play with your mind, so you can say it's time
Ready to be a god
Money needs begging for your love
Swim against the curse
Honey pushes you into the void
Demons are the hunt
Not long until you are full
Time is running out
As you build your chest grow taller
Grudge
That's all you can hide
I'm sorry boy
The hour is too late
We're so 12 behind the mastermind, the mastermind's gone blind
One of our own nation's souls are flat, and your heart's a sword
Our backs are the unlikely king, how's that?
How did you set free the voices in your head?
Spring kill, time fails if you pass away
Live a mentally insane soul
Take the second away
We saw the world behind the mask of madness, minds collide
World domination, souls of black, the path is way
Respect the galaxy king, hands of black
Let's give a set free, voice is in your head, scream kill
Time fails and you're passed away
Live on mentally, it's time to say
