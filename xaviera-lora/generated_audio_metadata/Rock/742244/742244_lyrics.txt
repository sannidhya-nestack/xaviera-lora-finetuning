She's not the same
She's afraid of change
See her running away
She's afraid of the rain
Let it rain, it's only rain
Let it rain, it's only rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain in jail
Let it rain
She seems deranged
She's afraid of jams
See her give it away
She's afraid of the rain, and I said, oh yeah
Let it rain, it's only rain
Let it rain, it's only rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain and change
Let it rain, yeah
Let it rain, it's only rain
Let it rain, it's only rain
Lightning thunder coming at your chase
Let it rain, yeah
