You don't need a therapist to show you how
To love somebody, love somebody
Don't need to be a poet or evangelist
To love somebody true
You don't need to be a Beatle or a PJ
To love somebody, love somebody
You don't need permission just to let it be
Just love somebody, dude
Excuseless form
Like rain around you
Lost and found you
Sing it again
Love is all around you yeah
But it's not all about you
Look before you leap, he's overrated
He who is a traitor told me so
Don't just spin your wheels, get your head over heels and go, oh
You don't have to sit and wait'til kingdom come
To love somebody, love somebody
Call yourself a Krishna or a Dharma bomb
Just love somebody, do
Excuses for night crane above you
Push and shove you
Sing it again
Love just might be everywhere
Don't wait for it to find you
You gotta love somebody
Gotta love someone
Just love somebody
Just love someone
You gotta love somebody
Oh yeah
Gotta love somebody, love somebody
Gotta love someone
