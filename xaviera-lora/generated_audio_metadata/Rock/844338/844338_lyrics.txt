We shared a small table, her friends surround her
We laughed and small talked and I thought I'd found her
The girl who could be everything I long for
The one I could give all I had and much more
She glanced straight at me her eyes were so concealing
And right then I knew it was my own walk
There isn't a moment I don't think of her
I know that it's useless but it's gotten much worse
She's making a fool out of me but I don't care
I'd rather be her lonely fool than alone here
I searched in her eyes for signs of love within
But all I could find there was my own one way feeling
Mirror back at me
I battle my heart in this inclination
There's no easy fix for this sad fixation
She glanced straight at me her eyes were so concealed
And right then I knew it was my own one way feeling
Mirror back at me
Mirror back at me
Mirror back at me
Mirror back at me
