I was in, I led with grace with head held high
A captivating charm authority
I was pure, I stood for truth when all was lost
If only for the slim minority
I was change, dissenting views dissident sights
No room for fair, no mediocrity
I was good, you'd look to me to write the world outside
And I'd delete
Back in the day, ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day, ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
I could see my visionary views were sought
Progressive outlooks on society I could feel
My gut was solid, cold as stone
A consequence of loyal piety
I could change, adapt and compromise
Evolve, laugh in the face of your anxieties
My memory's not what it used to be
But, hun, it drives my ego
Back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day (see you) (ooh) (ooh) (ooh) (ooh)
Ooh, my words were strong and real (I'll seal my own fate)
Back in the day (in sheer denial)
Bring this beast back home
Can I stay too straight?
Yield my whole faith
Defy everything I've ever known
Like a fan
I'll wake one day to find my limelight faded
Low subdued sobriety like a craze
I'll watch my withered seams and ties
Grow in distinct freedom variety like a man
The lines run deep now drawn and frail
A life soon lost unto antiquity like a state
Immortal words otten wisdoms eulogized
And cliche back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
Ooh, my words were strong and real
Back in the day
Ooh, my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
