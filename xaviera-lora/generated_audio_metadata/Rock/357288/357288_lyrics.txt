I've lost my love
Said all the words I know to make it right
Clutch tight my heart
And close my eyes
Speak of love
What once was beautiful is wretched now, my love
Scream love
So all the world will know you're finished with me, love
I've never felt like you tried
I want you to carry away all my fears tonight
In this lullaby
Every time you laugh, you scream, feel deep and hear me breathe
The forest gave way to the treachery of trees
And the boys of your past come screaming back
There's options now, built to last
And the fear that I feel I felt before
When the earthquakes came and crushed the door
We fell to the ground without making a sound
And I
I've never felt so alive
And I want you to carry the weight of the world tonight
In this lullaby
I loved the way you laughed, babe, I loved the way you moved
I loved the way you looked at me every time I stared at you
And there's a million words that would fit the bill
Describe this love in small detail
But they're bland and broken now like strangers' faces in a crowd
And you can scream free, a remedy as loud as long as you and me in the
Girl that I've tried to find
You lied, you lied
In the lullaby
Oh, oh, oh
Every time you laugh and speak
Feel deep in him and breathe
The forest deep away
To the treachery of treason
You lied
