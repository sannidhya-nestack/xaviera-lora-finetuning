Out of mind when you come around
But it's getting harder to turn you down
In that dress, you're such a mess and you know it
Out of minds, how they blur
Every time I get around her, oh, it's true, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, it's true, oh, oh, oh
You know it, ooh
I got time for a heart breather, huh, you
Oh, you're made of my mind, made of my mind
I got some time for a heart breather, huh, I
Oh, I made up my mind, made up my mind
You're making trouble everywhere you go
Now you want me to take you home, well, no, no, no
I ain't your fool
Hard times, how they come
Every time you have your fun, oh, it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And you know it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I got time for a heartbreak of honey and you
Oh, I made up my mind, made up my mind
I got some time for a heartbreak of honey and I
Oh, I made up my mind, made up my mind
You, I got time for a heartbreaker, honey, you
You made up my mind, all night
I got time for a whole break for one in, oh, oh, oh
Lord, I made up my mind, made up my mind
I got some time for a whole break for one in you
Oh, you made up my mind, made up my mind
You, you, you, you made up my mind
