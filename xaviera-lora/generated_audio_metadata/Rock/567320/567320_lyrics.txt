Back to square one, swept under the mannequin
I've been here before with you, look what you've done
Look where I am again, I'm falling to pieces
You are the one that brings me down and I'm fading away
Wasting my time
And I'm heading for the bottom, I'm on my own again
Our signals are crossed
And I can't find the satellites
That reflect how you feel about me
You welcome me in
But I can't spend another night
I'm fading away
Wasting my time
Welcome to the bottom
And I'll drink it away
And I'm heading for the bottom
I'm on my own again today
I can't hold on
But I can't let go
I had a crap, I let it slip away
What have I done, made an obvious mistake
I am so tired, of wasting time on you
I can't hold on
Wasting my time
Welcome to the bar, Joe
And I'll drink it away
I'm heading for the bar, Joe
I'm on my own again today
Still there
