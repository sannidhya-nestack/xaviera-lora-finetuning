How does it feel to have them pockets full of gold?
When you lay your head down in a bed so cold
One woman riding shotgun to the heart of your desire
Oh, you ain't ever gonna feel that fire
I won't lose that fire
I won't lose that fire
And I'm just a boy with a heart full of desire
Oh, I ain't ever gonna lose that fire
You did never think that you might need
Something more than the life you lead
An empty smile from an early retire
Oh, you ain't ever gonna feel that fire
I won't lose that fire
I won't lose that fire
I'm just a boy with a heart full of desire
Oh, I ain't ever gonna lose that fire
Oh, ain't never gonna lose it, no
Oh, ain't never gonna lose it, no
Ain't never gonna lose it, no
Yeah, I don't got no pockets full of gold
But these days I have are gonna be lived not sold
I won't lose that fire
I won't lose that fire
I'm just a boy with a heart full of desire
Oh, I ain't ever gonna lose that fire
I won't lose
That fire I won't lose
That fire I ain't never gonna lose it no
Ain't never gonna lose it no
Oh I ain't ever gonna lose that fire
