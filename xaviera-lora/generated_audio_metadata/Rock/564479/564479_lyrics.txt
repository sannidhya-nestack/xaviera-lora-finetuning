Everything you want from me and everything I need to be
Is it all, is it all worth my while?
Everything you got from me even when it don't belong to me
Everything I do
And everything I give to you
You really do not have a clue
Is it all, is it all worth my time?
I give everything, just anything
You make me feel like bed of pain
everything I do, yeah
Well is it you, is it me?
All the things you mean to me
Come on, feels like we're gonna drown
Then is it you or is it me? Everyone belongs you see
Well everything I do I do it for you
All the things you want me to
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Is it all, is it all worth your while?
But anything I ask from you
Do I ever get you to?
Nothing left to do
And everything you give to me
It never is enough you see
Is it all, is it all worth your time?
I'd give everything, just anything
Been treating you just like a king
everything I do, yeah
Well is it you, is it me?
Are all the things you mean to me?
Come on, feels like we're gonna drown
And is it you, or is it me?
Everyone belongs, you see, oh
Everything I do, I do it for you
I do it for you
I do it for you
Everything I do, I do it for
And is it you or is it me?
Everyone belongs you see
Everything I do, I do it for
Girl
Girl
I do it for you
