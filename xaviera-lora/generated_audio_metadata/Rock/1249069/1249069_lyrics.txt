Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire a tiny bounce in your head?
Well, tell me, and could you say please to a girl who's the man that you took your love with and killed?
She's a sight to see in this world
What's wrong? What's wrong? Did I hear that right?
It could never be, she's just in a high-heeled shoe
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
That's what's so fine, you're hiding in an air-frame seat
At what cost?
Lots of pretty penny, come and get some
Wouldn't you like a little treat?
Ten kids everywhere, trust me now, they were very many
She's a little woman, fifty went to one tough thing
Well-pruned sweets
Welcome to the sweetness
No miss money
Oh miss money
You're one sexy sweet honey
Is it fate that you adore miss money?
Now you got a little witchy like a little more
Miss money
Sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile
Tell me if you gonna tag my text
Possible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some things I think you think you've never seen before
She's got a world of bags but the little fatty
She knows she's very very very catty
I ain't up for love, it's something that she can't ever seem to get enough of
Slide love card, lights will bring apart, crashing is very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Monét, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person
To a person more like
Maybe your girlfriend, maybe your wife
Miss Monét, oh, she's no dummy
Lies love but it's never ever charming
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a piece of death, brother winged by
Push her bag stuck on her sleeping lines
The loan just the assets that are fueling her desires
She tricks her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just a pocket
Her locks are rings like the cash register chime
The love's a currency she can't seem to mine
Plays the miller fox on a pork burrito
Her feminisms are mud she'll never really know
Smile, oh, she's no dummy
Finds love but is never ever trained
But with the twinkle of green in her eyes
She's got this look they're watering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet and moderate
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desire
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment, not selling just to park it
Her laughter rings like a catcher's new chime
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
But if you don't have all but a portfolio
If you've been in love, you'll never really know how to love this one
You're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be a significant other person
The monkey of a woman she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love it seems too much
She makes money, oh
The irony's not lost
Can't budget for love it's an endless cost
Now she's big, no team, we're rockin' apart
A big self-failure, torn apart
But all this money
Is still inside in the cold hard cash of the night
All this money
You'll see if no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever coming
