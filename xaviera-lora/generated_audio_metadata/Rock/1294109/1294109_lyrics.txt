She's really quite the lovely, charming entertainer
But it seems all the people can't ever quite explain her
Beneath shining chandeliers she floats through the crowd
In gowns of scarlet velvet that mocks roses proud
There's a hush false before her, a reference under the din
Ms. Moesko's wicked smile can see her sweet secrets in
Entertainer
Who can explain her?
You never can change her
I think you're in danger
Weaked in silent whispers
Between laughter and champagne
Her eyes dark pools of promise
Each guest hopes to contain
She leads them through parlours
Where candles flicker low
The hush of midnight's rush
Where a darkness starts to flow
Subtle hints of redder dawn
Her lips and fingernails
A vision quite immortal
Where mortal memory fails
Entertainer
Who can explain her
You never can change her
I think you're in danger
Boop, ah, say what?
Boop, boop, ah, call you shot
Boop, ah, sweet spot, oh baby, you're so hot
She offers something tasty
Some think it must be wine
But the taste leaves them weaker
Entranced by her design
Each evening she convenes them
Beneath old oak and beans
In secret rooms where decades pass
Like phantoms slipped from dreams
Entertainer
Who can explain her
You never can change her
I think you're in danger
Her guests depart on sudden
Awake in morning's glow
With faint bruises near their throats
They claim they do not know
Johanna's parties linger on in legends none contained
A courageous vampire hostess with fame beyond her name
For though she charms completely each word and gesture coy
The truth lurks in her hunger a beauty made to destroy
She's really quite the lovely, charming entertainer
A timeless haunted presence
And no one can explain her lovely entertainer
Who can explain her?
You never can change her
Brother, I'm certain you're in grave danger
Danger, danger, ooh, ooh, ooh
Danger, danger
Ooh, ooh, danger
Ooh, ooh, danger
Entertainer
Who can explain her
You never can change her
Brother I'm serving, you're in grave danger
Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger
Danger, danger, danger, danger
