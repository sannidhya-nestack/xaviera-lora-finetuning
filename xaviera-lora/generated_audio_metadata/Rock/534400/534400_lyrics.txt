It's a really dark night
Waiting on the end of the line
You can't make up your mind
I can't make up my mind
You've laid it all out
And we sit in silence
For a really long time
Is it the end of time?
There's a fist in my chest
I'm keeping my breathing slow
Waiting for the body count
To see who'll stay or go
And I'm on your side, and I'm right here with you
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
You've won your prize, and you've won your war
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll be alone
I've flown a white flag
I've ceased all fire
My only arms are open arms
Still your guns are up
Your bullets keep flying
You gotta let the smoke clear
You gotta let your smoke clear
My hands are in the air
Tie me up and take me in
I'm giving up without a fight
I'm giving you the win
That I'm on your side
That I'm right here with you
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
You've won your prize
And you've won your war
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never Know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll be alone
Stop making teams and choosing sides
You won't conquest so you divide
Is that what you want?
Then what do you win?
The battle is over and we sit in silence
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
You've won your prize, you've won your war
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll never know
Keep your dukes up baby and you'll be alone
