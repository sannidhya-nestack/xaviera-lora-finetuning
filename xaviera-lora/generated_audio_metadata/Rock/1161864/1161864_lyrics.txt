Sometimes it rains, sometimes there's sunshine
Now you see so well, now you feel so blind
Sometimes you find love, sometimes your heart breaks
You never fail when you learn from your mistakes
This is life, you live as you go
This is life, mix of light and shadow
This is life, you learn everyday
This is life, gain and loss all the way
Here there are mountains, there you see valleys
Sometimes you're so free, sometimes you've worries
This is life, you live as you go
This is life, mix of light and shadow
This is life, you learn everyday
This is life, gain and loss on the way
Happiness and sorrow
Life is cries and smiles
Hopes of a brighter tomorrow
Dreams of a friendlier mile
This is life, this is life
You live as you go
This is life, mix of light and shadow
This is life, you learn everyday
This is life, gain and loss all the way
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life, this is life, this is life
