It was real early
The day they served me
It was the summons
That shook my plumbing
My ex wife Janie
She tried to frame me
And make me nervous
For no good purpose
I ain't got no money
Ain't got no money
To buy you honey
It ain't the season
There ain't no reason
'Cause I ain't got no money
Someone woke up Sunday morning
The song was ringing loud
Went and checked the messages
To see what it's about
Creditors want payments
Whole lowest wants them too
The hole is getting deeper
I don't know what to do
I got this client, he's always crying
He thinks he owns me for half of my fee
He makes decisions and never listens
But he don't worry, no
He's in a hurry
And he's got lots of money
Got no money to buy you honey
There ain't the season
There ain't no reason
'Cause I hate God no money
