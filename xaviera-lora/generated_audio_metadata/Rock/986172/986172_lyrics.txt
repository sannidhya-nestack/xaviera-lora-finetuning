Hey, don't you have a piece of my heart?
I think you might wanna give it back quick
Don't you think about giving it back quick
You know you really don't know how to use it
Hey, don't you have a piece
Oh my heart, you better not give it to him now
He don't know how to use it, he might abuse it
And you really can't afford to lose it
Empty, time is no time
Bed with someone for that dough is no surprise
That you're empty, or etting
Love is important to us all
Your time might be a concern of mine you see
People are tired
Sick of living in doubt
Future
Though it's all clearly up by you now
In the present
Finding purpose for
Every sentiment you
Try a journey
Try a walk around the world by yourself
Hey, I'm throwing back that piece of your heart
And thanks for letting me borrow it now
I'm sure I'll get it back to you somehow
You've shown us all that it's not worth keeping
Try a journey, try a walk around the world by yourself
