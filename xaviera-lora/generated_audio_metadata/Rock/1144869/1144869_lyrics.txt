Where the fire heats, the earth I hear ceasing in the glaring bright
The lava incubates, the breeze that darkens the life-bringing light
Skinny hands stretch out of a rotten decay
Digging themselves out, awakened to get on their way
Awake the evil to creep the moonlit lane
Through cracks and holes to shut the door will be in way
Awake the evil to creep the moonlit street
Even behind thick walls your fear is their feet
Where the people go to sleep I hear whispering in the gloomy night
Crash in their nightmares by the violence of an immense wave
The evil find the host to hollow out and the body die
They colonize the earth and colorize the realistic sight
Now once you're clouded with shadows
We will surround you everywhere
And soon you'll be an empty hollow
Awake the evil to create the moonlit lane
Through cracks and holes to shut the door we'll be in way
Await the evil to creep the moonlit street
Even behind thick walls your fear is their feet
