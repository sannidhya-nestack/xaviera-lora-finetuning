When I sleep the strangest dreams
Take me places I've not been
But something's keeping me awake
Coiled over like a snake
Builds a whisper to a scream
As the sun goes down on me
All these arrows in my heart break the mirror in half
Never enough, never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Dizzy at the top of fierce skies
Nothing ever let me get quite this high
And I'm storming back to life
Infinite dream, infinite time
It's all rearranged
I broke the white light to see
The many colours it brings
And now I can't see a thing
Never enough, never enough
No I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Never enough, no I know it's never enough
Feel it permeate my sleep
Driving nails through my dreams
Crossing my palm with Bobois
And I'm slowly catching fire
Can't remember what I've seen
What these premonitions mean
Where it hurts I cannot tell
Is it heaven or hell
Never enough, never enough, no I know it's never enough, never enough, no I know it's never enough, never enough, no I know it's never enough, never enough, no I know it's ever enough, never enough, no I know it's ever enough, never enough, no I know it's ever enough, never enough, no I know it's ever enough, never enough, no I know it's ever enough
