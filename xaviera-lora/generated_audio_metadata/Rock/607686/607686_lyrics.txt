I love you regardless
Oh hallelujah Jeff, you're not so silent Jens
Five years, one month, and fourteen days
It's been half a decade and I'm still the same
This New Year's Eve bash is depressing me
There's color and light but John I see it in black and white
Jonah said it right I'm your number one
I'd defend you even though you were holding the gun
My back wound heals as the days go by
Thank God I'm alive
Beach she had it easy
Friends will love you regardless
Oh hallelujah Jeff
You're not so silent Jens
And time will tear us apart now
Oh Junebug's coming back
Yeah Junebug's coming back
H .P. Jones I wish I had one
A story like that to move everyone
The days seem longer as they're passing by
Cause nothing has passed
I'm still in the hideout
It's stuck in my head and I can't, I can't get it out of my head, go, go, go, go
Dead set sink or swim I'm drowning
Did I make mistakes? Did I make mistakes?
We've always had you figured out
Everybody knows that you're gonna change the world
