(Howling)
Look at that beauty just waiting for me
Got the sweetest curls that I ever seen
So nice
Turning around
Ooh what a noise
I'm ready to fly with my beautiful toy
Man, I'm a machine
Man, I'm a machine
I got it made, a sun in my face
Driving my Ferrari down B .C .A .S.
Fire and steel, thrusting back in 4C
Adrenaline rushing, never smarts in my heart
Man and machine
Man and machine
Listen, in evolution, natural fusion
Body and soul with mechanical
Science fiction, freedom fiction
Flying desire makes you feel alive
Can't explain it, got the feeling
Riding on a dream
I built up a face, not a brick out of place
She feel like a rocket in the air fast
I got an aide, she takes me all the way, oh yes
Man and machine
Man and machine
Man and machine
Man and machine
Ride it
All the time before I had
Sweet Jesus
MAMA!
