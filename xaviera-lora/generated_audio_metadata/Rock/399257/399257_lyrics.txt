This pencil and a dream
No eraser, better recall all you've seen
This pretty looking person
At rehearsal with the zebras
I'm expecting the director to be hitting
On her conscience
Guilty of a scene she never starred in
Worthy of the part
She always plays waiting for a bridge to build itself across the ocean
This camera in her pocket
Taking pictures of the inside of her blue jeans
There's a TV but it's broken
No commercials, you must be kidding me
There's a mirror around the bend
She can look, she can look, she can look
But she can't send her reflection
See she's guilty of a sin
She never started
Where the odd part
She always plays
Waiting for a bridge to
Build itself
Across the ocean
The director
And the actress
On a mattress
Gonna have some fun
To the director
Any actress on a mattress and a blunt for fun
He guilty of a sin she never edits
Guilty of a crime that ain't so bad
Waiting for a bridge to build itself across the ocean
Damn, guilty of a sin that never started in
Worthy of the part that always plays
Waiting for a bridge to build itself across the ocean
