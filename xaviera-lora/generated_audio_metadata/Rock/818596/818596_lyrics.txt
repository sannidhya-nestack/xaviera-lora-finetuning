Cruel disposition, mindless indecision
Mine were the choice, you be history
And every night and every day
Begging my soul, won't you go away
Well and time will tell
Just how strong I can be
And I pray to the Lord now
Please won't you leave me be
I'm begging you man won't you leave me be
Well, down by the river
All the animals are dead
Watered down, got poisoned
And they ain't found nobody yet
Strange kind of feeling
Oh, and the atmosphere
And I pray to the Lord now
Please don't you leave me here
Well don't you leave me here
Well alright now
Oh have mercy now, alright
Well, nine days without sleep
And eight bottles of sleep and pills
Seven bottles of whiskey
And six, six, six dollar bills
Oh five maids are leaping
Yeah, four sinners in the sand
Three kings approaching
Two bullets and one gun in my hand
Oh yeah
And I pray to the lord
Please don't you let go
Of mine
Oh, don't you let go
Of your cruel disposition (cruel disposition)
Yeah, cruel disposition (yeah, cruel disposition)
