You and me in a scene so vibrant
There's a golden sheen and we're turning new leaves
What a day to ride
You're the moon and I'm the ocean tide
You pull me in, yeah, yeah
You pull me in and I'll be by your side
Come on, let's ride
There's nothing to fear and not a thing to hide
We got the time, yeah, we, we got the time
So come on, let's ride (ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)
Rolling green in the fields of summer
Playing out our dreams
Like we'll live forever, we'll live forever
No rain, no thunder
Just clear skies we're under
And we wonder what's on the other side
You're the floating heart of the ocean tide
You pull me in, yeah yeah
You pull me in and I'll be by your side
Come on let's ride this
Nothing to fear and not a thing to hide
We got the time, yeah we, we got the time so come on let's ride
You wait, don't hesitate, let's be free
What a day to ride
You're the moon and I'm the ocean tide
You pull me in, yeah, yeah, you bring me in and
I'll be by your side, tomorrow let's ride
There's nothing to fear and not a thing to hide
We got the time, yeah, we, we got the time
So come on, let's ride
