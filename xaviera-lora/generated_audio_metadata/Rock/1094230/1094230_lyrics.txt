I want the best for you all
Out in the wild
We don't go to school
I hardly know anything but from what I've met
I want to meet people with opposing sentiments
Out of these woods there is nothing but excess and slope
And I won't
But my bridge is with the world
And I won't et to leave all the lessons you have taught
But I'll wait for everyone else to come close
I'm awake for any reason, I'm late for every second of your vacation
All I wanted was to be more
And all I wanted was to be
I want a home where no one else tells me how to live
By buying more shit from the shelf
And all I have learned is useless now that you are here
And maybe if
Hold up back to this time you will see
But all I know is oh
Burn my bridges with you oh
And I won't et to sing all the anthems you have sung
But I'll wait for everyone else to fall away
I'm awake for any reason
I'm here for every second of education
Make me happy
With something for my room
I belong here
At least that's what I've heard
Help me listen
For my understanding
And abandon
I'll get something more
Burn everything to the ground
Keep the fires on, ignore every lesson you have learned
And you'll et everyone is fucking gone
I'm awake for not a reason, I'm late for the beginning of your revelation
all I wanted was to be more than this
And all I wanted was to be
