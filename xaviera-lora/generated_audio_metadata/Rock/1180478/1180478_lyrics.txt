Look at me, sunny man, when I talk to you
Look at me, look at me, when I talk to you
Cross
Crawl, why don't you crawl once more in petunias
The day you were born
There was a big storm
You were never meant to fit in
So feel yourself everywhere
So feel yourself everywhere
We need your colors
We need your colors
Stop, stop, no more
You and me, nevermore
The city lights will be your fans
The moon your spotlight
And you will dance and you will sing and you will play
While everything disappears
Everything will disappear
