Fair skin, pale face, as in it's my case
Warm paint, I've been hostile
Perfect scene with a devil's smile
And baby blues got me off guard
I felt that bruise as I felt so hot
A breaking heart is a work of art
The way that I see it
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me
Angel's wings, black tattoo
My puppet strings I gave to you
Dancing tongues, citric blue
Infant lungs because of you
And baby blues, the guardian of gods
I fell on that bruise as I felt so hot
A breaking heart is a work of art
The way that I see it
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me
Oh
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me
And baby blues, caught me off guard
I felt that bruise as I felt so high
A broken heart is a broken heart
And what I see should be the death of me
And baby blues, caught me off guard
I felt that bruise as I felt so high
A breaking heart is a work of art
The way that I see it
You'll be the death of me
You'll be the death of me
Oh
