You wanna know why
You were living a lie
It was so long ago
How could you know
You were nobody's child
And all of your life
You don't even cry
Left out on your own
Try to make it alone
But you wanted to fly
Don't wait all of your life
The only love you know
Is hiding in your soul
But it was never enough
For all the ones that you loved
You're born beautiful
Don't ever let it go
The inner child you know
So don't you ever give up
Just know that you are the one
You're born beautiful
Turn on the light
And come out of the night
There's so much more than you know
And wherever you go
Someone loves you tonight
And feeling alive
For once in your life
In your heart let it show
Let the light in you glow
There's no reason to hide
Don't wait all of your life
The love you know is hiding in your soul
But it was never enough for all the ones that you loved
The born beautiful don't ever let it go
The inner child you know
So don't you ever give up
Just know that you are the one
You're born beautiful
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
The only love you know
Is hiding in your soul
But it was never enough
For all the ones that you loved
You're born beautiful
Don't ever let it go
The inner child you know
So don't you ever give up
Just know that you were the one
You're born beautiful (so beautiful)
The only love you know
Is hiding in your soul
You were more than enough
And you were always the one
You're born beautiful (so beautiful)
You're born beautiful
You're so beautiful
You are more than enough
And you were always the one
You're born beautiful
