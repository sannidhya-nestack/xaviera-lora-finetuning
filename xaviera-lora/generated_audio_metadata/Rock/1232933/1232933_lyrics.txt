May I keep this full moon
May I dance with my moon
Moonlight dance, it's over
All the ages cease
I et, I remember
I will follow the hours
I will see as I lived
For a million years
Guides me, this path lives on
This moon, tells me, this song lives on
I caress your body, I ignite your passions
You will know my darling, secret of my heart
I caress you and I kiss you, our sweet win is calling
Yes I live
Innocent for a million years
Stars have gone in frozen
Oceans, stars are all looking into the sea
All my heart and all my passion
All my love and my caresses
I will give you here and now
And my moon it starts above me
And it's golden in this ocean
Dancing forever for us
This song guides me
This spell lives on
This moon spells me
This song lives on
My stars, my stars, my stars
Always watching
Oh, nice to be
Oh, nice to be
