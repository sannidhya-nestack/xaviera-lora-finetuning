You say you feel elated with so much to feign
You say that you were chosen how could you be so vain
I say silence is golden and bury your head in the sand
You helpless turn hopeless and live in a suite on the end
But nothing ever stays with me
Feeling never stays with me
Sweetest taste turns bitter
The sweetest taste turns bitter
But nothing ever stays with me
Feeling never stays with me
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Finally I'm, I'm awakened from my dream
You only wanted to erase me, you only wanted to deface me
You're never gonna break me down
I'll get inside of you, I'll get inside of you, I'll get inside of you
Good luck, you're never gonna break me
You only wanted to erase me, you're never gonna break me down
You're overrated'cause you're just like God
You're selling an illusion that I see right through
Still tired conclusions still started by you
I say silence is golden and bury your head in the sand
You helpless, turn hopeless, I live in a suite, I am
Nothing ever stays with me
Feeling never stays with me
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Nothing ever stays with me
Feeling never stays with me
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Sweetest taste turns bitter
Suddenly I'm awakened from my dream
You only wanted to erase me
You only wanted to defeat me
You're never gonna bring me down
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you
Feel like you're never gonna break me
You only wanted to erase me
You're never gonna bring me down
You're overrated'cause you talk like God
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you
I'll get inside of you, I'll get inside of you, I'll get inside of you
