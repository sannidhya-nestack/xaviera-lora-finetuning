You're throwing a switch
I'm begging please
Last thing you wanna do is bring me to my knees
Don't shed the light on the dark side of me
I'm begging to you baby
Don't let that side of me get free
A man, yeah, can only go so far
When he gets a cut, he knows he'll leave a scar
Don't shed the light
Oh, on the dark side of me
I'm begging to you baby
Don't let that side of me get free
It's 2am and I'm at home
Where you been? I know you ain't alone
Don't shed no light on the dark side of me
I'm begging to you baby
Don't let that side of me get free
It's way, way, way, way, way, way too late
Well, you've been just driving me insane
Don't shine the light on the dark side of me
I'm begging to you baby
Don't let that side of me get free
Yeah, I'm begging to you, baby
You don't wanna see that part of me get free
I'm begging to you, baby
Don't let the dark side of me get free
The dark side, dark side of me
Oh, I'm begging to you, baby
Don't let the dark side of me get free
