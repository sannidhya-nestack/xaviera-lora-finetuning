I'm calling you up, I'm counting you down
Carving out a path to where you are
It's automatic, even blind and in the dark
It's almost like you're calling me
Gonna get to where you are
Carving out a place for me to stay
Trying to find my only hideaway
I think I hear
I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I'm counting you down, I've got to get to where you are, where you are, where you are, where you calling me, gotta get to where you are, calling me when, I'm counting you down, pumping all the blood out of my heart, calling you up, counting you down, these puzzles are making me your slave, calling you when, I'm counting you down
You're taking all the sleep out of my day
Calling you up, counting it down
The perfect way to misbehave
One, two, three, go
You picture paints a perfect map
Carving out a way to get you back
It's almost like you're calling me
You've always known
Baby when I get there
I said baby when I get there
I'm calling you up, I'm counting you down
Pumping all the blood out of my heart
(Counting it up, counting it down)
These puzzles are making me your slave
(One, two, three, go)
(I'm counting it down)
You're taking all the sleep out of my brain
(One, two, three, go)
(I'm counting it down)
Shoveling the dirt into my grave
(Five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five)
Into my grave
Coming out of the past to where you are, where you are
I said baby when I get there, I said baby when I get there
One, two, three, go, I'm killing you
Pumping all the blood out of my heart
One, two, three, go, I'm cutting it down
These puzzles are making me insane
One, two, three, go, I'm killing you
You're taking all the sleep out of my life to bring you up (I'm carrying you down)
Shoveling the dirt into my grave
