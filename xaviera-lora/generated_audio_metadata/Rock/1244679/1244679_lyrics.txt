Erica
I don't mean to stare at ya
But I've never seen such beauty
Except maybe in some movie
Makes it hard to talk when you first walk up to me
It's like I'm scared of ya
Erica
I wish I could be there with ya
But I bet you got somebody
He's probably some sweet hottie
I bet he's never ever mean or mad or snotty
No not with Erica
When she smiles it fills my head
My mouth gets dry my face gets red
Still hang on every word she said to me
Oh yeah
Yes she's the one that turns my head
But I can tell by every word she said
She's no idea how she's affecting me
Oh Erica
One thing that I could care for you
But I don't think you see me as somebody that dreamy
But I'm pretty sure that it ain't never gonna be me
Not with Erica
Not with Erica
Not with Erica
