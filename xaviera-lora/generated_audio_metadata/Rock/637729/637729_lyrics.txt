Then suck the heat then stride
Maybe we're just dreaming
Maybe we're just wrong
Or maybe all that's missing is the one
We'll keep fighting to turn the page
It's sad that some things will never change
It's the simple things that'll save us
Sick of your narrow aspirations
Status or worse yet status quo
Short of humbled expectations
You're holding the helpless heads below
We've been hoarding the key to life forever
Refusing to share on grounds we're blessed
When family reached out for compassion
We sold them out for less
When the light pushed its edicts through
We swore regression ends
Where were your hands?
We'll keep fighting to turn the page
Knowing that some things will never change
It's the simple things that'll save us
How can we hope to win against the primal red tape within
It's the simple things that'll save us
Yeah, the simple things will save us
