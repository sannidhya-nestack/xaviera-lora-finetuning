You say I can't get much better
I say I can't get much worse
So I sit and write this five page letter
Try and understand the words I wrote
Better me to see just who you are
Better you now go and be a star
Yeah, yeah
Fuck off
I see you're in this for the better
And even though things can get much worse
I can't remember the last we spoke
Rest your right hand on the member that let you roll
Better me to see just who you are
Better you now go and be stopped
Better you now go and be a star
Better me see just who you are
Better you now go and be a star
