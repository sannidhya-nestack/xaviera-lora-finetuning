Caught in the web of our design
Mona slipped through lights divine
Underneath the surface we mingle and collide
A spark ignites leaving nowhere to hide
Golden threads they intertie
In your arms the stars align
With every glance a story's told
In your veins I find my goal
Across the night your voice hits clear
Through the chaos you draw me near
Hidden truths in whispered tones
In your presence, I'm not alone
Golden threads they intertwine
In your arms the stars align
Every glance a story's told
In your veins I find my door
Beneath the moon of crimson sight
You're touching darkness into light
A bond that can't be broken down
In this embrace I'll never drown
From the silence we emerge
Through your love I feel the surge
No more fears, no more lies
In your gaze the fire flies
Golden threads they intertwine
In your arms the stars align
With every glance a story's told
In your veins I'll find my goal
Together we'll face the unknown
In this glow we've always shown
With every breath our love unfolds
In this journey we strive through
