Walk a mile in my shoes
Spend a night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
Great places where the end of day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue'bout what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile
In my shoes
Downtown there's a ragged man
Getting by the best he can
Says he just needs a helping hand
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'm hurting here can't you see?
I need a drink not sympathy
Before you look down your nose at me
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spend the night crying my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'd trade places with you any day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue'bout what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile
In my shoes
Mm-hmm, up down there's a pretty girl
Big house, nice car and pearls
Says before you covered my world
Walk a mile in my shoes
My husband barely comes home
I'm left here all alone
With two kids I raised on my own
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spin a knot, cry my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
I'd trade places with you today
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue'bout what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile in my shoes
Gucci, Skechers, Prada, flip-flops
Don't matter which of ones you wear
Jimmy Choo, Nike, Tona, Lama, Birkenstocks
Troubles come and never repair
Walk a mile in my shoes
Spinning out crowd my blues
You'll be glad that you're you
Walk a mile in my shoes
Trade places with the other day
You wouldn't wanna go my way
If you want a clue about what I've been through
Walk a mile, walk a mile, walk a mile
In my shoes
