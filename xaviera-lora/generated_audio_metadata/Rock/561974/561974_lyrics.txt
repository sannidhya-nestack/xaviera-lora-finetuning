Am I wasting time?
Is this all that I am?
I'm old and I'm weak
Well at least in my head
I could easily spend all my time making believe I could fly
I can't seem to keep my head out of the clouds
Just think if I crash
What if I just refuse to
And if I don't want I'm dreaming
Or if I cry when you see
Will you help me believe in
There is something for me
Am I lose in faith?
I'm so tired of seekers
Are you cold and alone?
Does it help if you moan?
We could easily run from this world
Though they break all our bones
If I had just one last thing to say
At the end of the day
I'd stare down the gap and smile indeed
So if I die while I'm dreaming
Or if I cry when you see
Will you help me believe in
There is something for me
And if I die while I'm dreaming
Or if I cry when you say
Will you help me believe in
There is something for me
And if I die while I'm dreaming
Or if I cry when you say
Will you help me believe in
There is something for all men
What if I die in this dream
Or if I cry
Will you stay? Will you help me believe it? There's something for me (I will stand by you)
