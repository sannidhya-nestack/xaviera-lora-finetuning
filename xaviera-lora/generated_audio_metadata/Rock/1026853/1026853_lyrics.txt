I thought she was heaven sent
Now I'm filled with deep regret
Where did all those happy feelings go
I don't know
Things didn't work out like I planned
Now I feel like half a man
I'll just go and hang my head and cry
Wondering why
Yes I should have seen the writing on the wall
No I never thought she'd leave me after all
After all
Living in this loneliness
How I miss her sweet caress
Wish that there was something I could do
I'm so blue
Yes I should have seen the writing on the wall
No I never thought she'd leave me after all
After all
It's all such a mystery
How could any girl do this to me
To me
You can mock my words my friend
I will never fall in man
Unless she comes around this way again
I thought she was heaven sent
Now I'm filled with deep regret
Where did all those happy feelings go?
I should have seen the writing on the wall
No I never thought she'd leave me after all
When it hurts like this a man can feel so small
No I never thought she'd leave me after all
