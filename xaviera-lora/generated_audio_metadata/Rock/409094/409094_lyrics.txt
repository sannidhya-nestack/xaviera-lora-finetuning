I've been walking to the edge of night
I've been searching forever to see inside, inside
Now the streets are lined with the shade of gold
All the answers we need have all been told, told
Now there's nothing to say, nothing to do
Everything that you need was inside of you
Look around and you'll see there's nowhere else
All the essence of imagery
There's nowhere else on the earth I would rather be
I was looking to find another way
I was listening out to people say, say
Now the lights are fading into night
All the ashes on earth are left behind, behind
Now there's nothing to say, nothing to do
Everything that you need was inside of you
Look around and you'll see there's nowhere else
Nothing's bigger than you and me
There's nowhere else on the earth I would rather be
