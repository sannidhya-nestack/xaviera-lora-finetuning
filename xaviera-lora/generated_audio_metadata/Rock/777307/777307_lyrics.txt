Telling your lies to the girls in the powder room
About your man in the bedroom that came too soon
Blanking out the border with your sorry tattoos
Your just a precious little ego with an edge to bruise
One more drink, one more smoke, one more thrill, the sick jokes
Beautiful is empty
She's a beautiful attraction
A beautiful distraction
A beautiful loves no one
Unless you're given what she is and you're
Throwing it all away
You're giving yourself away
And throwing it all away
Throwing it all away, you're giving yourself away, you're throwing it all, all away
Setting your sights on a void that's worth a second look
Perhaps a wife but in this light you read'em just like books
Living the moments between survival and bliss
So unrelated, downright deflated, down by the whole pretence
One more drink, one more smoke, one more thrill, the sick jokes
Beautiful is empty
She's a beautiful attraction
A beautiful distraction
Beautiful loves no one
Unless you're bleeding on your knees and you're
Throwing it all away
Giving yourself away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away, you're giving yourself away, you're throwing it all away, yeah
Just your red light burning blue as I'm tripping over you
Just your red light burning blue
As I'm tripping over you
It's been a long day coming
How long will it last
Before your last chance leaving
And you're watching it pass
Pause the people to find
The good in someone please
What's happening to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Throwin' it all away
You're giving yourself away
Throwin' it all away, oh
Throwin' it all away, oh
Giving yourself away, oh
Throwin' it all, throwin' it all, throwin' it all away
You're throwing it all away, you're
Giving yourself away, you're
Throwing it all away, you're
Throwing it all away, you're
You're giving yourself away, you're
Throwing it all away, yeah
Ooh
