The more that I see you, the more I believe
You came here to show me
There's so much more here than what you can see
Now there's stars all around you, just thought you should know
You said we could live forever
I say you should take my hand and go
This life is magic
It's dancing around me
This life is magic
Funny how you showed it to me
Baby you found me
Chasing futures alone
With nothing but crazy
Losing my mind trying to find a way home
But all of the fear now
Just strip it away
Try to believe how
There's nothing here but magic and we're starting today
This life is magic
It's dancing around me
This life is magic
Honey how you showed it to me
Oh, it's magic
Oh, oh
This life is magic, it's dancing around me
This life is magic, funny how you showed it to me
This life is magic, it's dancing around me
This life is magic, funny how you showed it to me
