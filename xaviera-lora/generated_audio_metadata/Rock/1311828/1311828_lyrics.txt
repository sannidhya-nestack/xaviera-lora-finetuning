Noah was a good man
In a world grown wicked and dark
When God said, "You must save the innocent"
Go forward and build me an ark
He gathered birds, he gathered animals
Brought them forth, pairing two by two
Man would soon meet a terrible fate
So creation could start anew
Forty days and forty nights
He cried out loud at the dreadful sight
Forty days and forty nights it rained
Forty days and forty nights it rained
The air rumbled with thunder
The sky exploded with fingers of light
And when the storm swallowed everything
It turned the day into blackest night
Forty days and forty nights
He stood in fear of heaven's might
Forty days and forty nights it rained
Forty days and forty nights it rained
The sun came out and the waters receded
The land was found by a single dove
Noah had fulfilled his covenant promise
A new beginning of peace and love
Forty days and forty nights
To rid the world of an evil blight
Forty days and forty nights it rain
Forty days and forty nights
Bring on the rain, rain, rain
Bring on the rain, rain, rain
Bring on the rain, rain, rain
