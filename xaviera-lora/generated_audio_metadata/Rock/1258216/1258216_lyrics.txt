In the basement where the static comes
Old vinyl scratches, the rhythm drums
Faded posters on the crumbling walls
A ghostly chorus in these hollowed halls
Static echoes, they call my name
Through the chaos, we play the game
Lost in the noise, we're all the same
Static echoes, no one to blame
Gotten tunes, black speakers there a otten tune
Covered melodies under the moon
Empty bottles all across the floor
We search for something but we're not sure
Static echoes, they call my name
Through the chaos, we play the game
Lost in the noise, we're all the same
Static echoes, no one's in pain
Gotten tunes
Black speakers play a otten tune
Copper melodies under the moon
Empty bottles roll across the floor
We search for something but we're not sure
Flickering lights in a dusty room
Shadows dance to an old cartoon
Broken strings on a worn out guitar
In this echo chamber we've gone too far
The epiphany tears untold
In the static secrets unfold
Whispers of rebels, voices aloud
We sing our truth, lost in the crowd
Static echoes, they call my name
Through the chaos
We play the game
Lost in the noise
We're all the same
Static echoes, no one to blame
As the static fades and the light goes home
We find solace in the stories told
In the echoes we find our place
In the static we arise
Now is your honour, we find our place in the static we embrace
