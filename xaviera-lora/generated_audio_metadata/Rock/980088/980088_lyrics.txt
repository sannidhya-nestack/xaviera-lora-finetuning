Hear the noise, I'm paranoid
I'm the ghost and you're the toy
These flesh and bones they were meant to break
So everybody sing and congregate
With this dead boy that is not a man
It's hard to keep that demon locked inside
Let's peel the skin and scratch'em one more time
Here I go (go, go, go, go, go)
Here I go (go, go, go, oh)
It's hard to sleep, it's hard to dream
Been trying to hide that dirty thing
You can take a stand or take a knee
Either way it goes, we play the game
Nothing is what it seems, and, and, and
Let's fill this void with all this selfish pride
Let's kill the boy then bring him back to life
Here I go (here I go)
Here I go (here I go)
Here I go (here I go)
