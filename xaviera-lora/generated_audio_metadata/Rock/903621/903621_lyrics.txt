Sitting on the cotton floor
Blinded by the light
I am watching the river flow
The sun is shining bright
Everything seemed flat as a feather
Before gravity pulled me down
All my dreams came falling apart
Like a puzzle on the ground
I wanna know
But my heart is like stone
I'm waiting for the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, washing away all pain and peril
Rain, oh rain, after the storm comes a brand new day
I was never pitiful
Not afraid to play in the dark
Never had to worry
Never struggled, hidden the mark
Then my life turned upside down
I was broken and numb
Our souls were hurt, we almost drowned
Waiting for the tears to come
I wanna cry
But my heart is like stone
I'm waiting for the rain, rain
Washing away all pain and peril, rain
Rain, after the storm comes a brand new day
Rain, rain, washing away all pain and peril
Rain, oh rain, after the storm comes a brand new day
I'm waiting for the rain, rain
Washing away all pain and peril, rain, oh rain
After the storm comes a brand new day, rain, rain
Washing away all pain and peril, rain, rain
After the storm comes a brand new day
