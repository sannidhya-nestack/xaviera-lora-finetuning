So blur that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you are
Between who can't be believed
So blur that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you
Remember who you were
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
And I'll say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
Just follow your heart, don't fall apart
So cold that I can't sleep
So hard I can't resist
I can't remember who I am
My body's all I ever made
So cold that I can't sleep
So hard I can't resist
I can't remember who I am
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
And I say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just follow your heart
Just follow your heart
Don't fall apart, don't fall apart (No, no)
Don't fall apart
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you can do it
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you'll still rock it
Don't fall apart, you're amazing
Don't fall apart, you can rock it
Don't fall apart, you'll still do it
Don't fall
Don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just fall your heart
And I say don't fall apart, don't judge yourself and just fall your heart
Just fall your heart
Don't fall apart, don't fall apart (I'm about to see you)
Don't fall apart, don't fall apart now
So blurred that I can't see
So far it can't be me
I can't remember who you are
This pain can't be released
