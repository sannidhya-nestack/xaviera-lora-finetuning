Wake me up at 5am
Ask me how I feel
Through the night, winter and day
My answer will be the same
You're going down
But I still feel like I'm doing alright
You're rising up, I'll be with you
I'm the one I just feel for too
it's been raining all day, I stay up all night
At home all alone, sitting in my room
Watching rainbows falling down the window
Glass on my soul, the crying skies
Living it whole, living it all
Knocking back at the door and guess what? (What?)
I'm putting on my yellow shoes (I got it)
I'm taking my umbrella (I got it)
In my yellow coat I'm going out, no (What?)
The color of the sun is the best for working in the rain right now, yeah
And we all, and we all, and we all will say no
Wearing different shoes searching one another under the rain
We stay strong until we get along
We stay strong, get along
Get along
Now let's get back to me
Walking down the street
With an umbrella in hand
And autumn leaves in my hair
Though it rained like hell
I felt so well
I just simply knew that in the end I'd find you
Really don't know what it did to you
So stay on your pathway and you'll get it through
you wouldn't always get what you want
But you got it
(I got it) all you need (I'm feeling it)
So enjoy this moment, I'm gonna refrain (yeah)
Here we are, here we are, here we are, I say no
Wearing different shoes, searching one another under the rain
We stay strong until we get along
We stay strong, get along, get along
W-w-wake me up at five am
Ask me how I feel
Through the night and during day
My answer will stay the same
You're going down, I'm gone with you
But I still feel like I'm doing alright, rising up
I'll be with you
in the end I feel for two
You're rising up, I'll be with you
You're falling down, I'll be with you
You're rising up, I'll be with you
in the end I feel for two
Ain't we all, ain't we all, ain't we all the same now?
Wearing different shoes, searching one another under the rain
We stay strong until we get along
And we all, and we all, and we all the same, no
We're in a desert dream, yeah
No matter what I say, we stay strong, but I love you
Until we get stronger
We stay strong, can't get along
We are the same, we stay strong, strongest
We are the same, we stay strong, won't get along
Get along, get along, get get get along, get along, get along
Get get get along, get along, get along, get get get, get get get, get get get along
