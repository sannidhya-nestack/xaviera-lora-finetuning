Please don't tell me that you had it bad too
I don't give a rat's that you played me like a fool
I tried to warn you
I don't like these little games
Now just sit back and watch as I set the world ablaze, oh
One at a time, I do my time
I will consent because I did the crime
Oh, I'm guilty of loving you
I'm guilty of loving you
Oh, I'm just an alley cat
I slink by when I can
Even this pussycat
Will crawl out high rise without a plan
You were a predator in the night
It's all dark and dangerous
Lost at first sight
I tried to hold you but you were gone by days of light
Let the world ablaze, oh
One at a time, I do my time
I will consent because I did the crime
Oh, I'm guilty of loving you
I'm guilty of loving you
