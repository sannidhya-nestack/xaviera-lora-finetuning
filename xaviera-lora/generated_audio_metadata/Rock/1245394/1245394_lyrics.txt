I'm just a heart pumping out the pain
A high-tained memory driving me insane
Then I love a reckless desire
Gonna shift gears and set my soul on fire
Driving love like a runaway train
Gonna crash into your heart and make it feel the same
Driving love with the pedal to the floor
Gonna find the thrill that I've been waiting for
Strive into love like a runaway train
Gonna crash into your heart and make it feel the same
Try to can't, fears can't hold me back
Gonna drive all night, get to your lover's house
Strive in love like a runaway train
Gonna crash into your heart and make it feel the same
Strive in love with a battle to the floor
Gonna find the thrill that I've been looking for
Speeding, many sides can't slow me down
A net full of love spinning me around
GPS hard navigated through the night
A side of drive all night to get to your love attack
Feel just a heart pumping out the pain
A high-tained memory driving me insane
Red line level reckless desire
Gonna shift gears and set my soul on fire
And shift gears and set myself on fire
