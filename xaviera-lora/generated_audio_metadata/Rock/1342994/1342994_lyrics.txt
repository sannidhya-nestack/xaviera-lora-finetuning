We were miles to a porch light dancing on the breeze
Suitcase full of thunder, shoes and memories
You trace my wandering heartbeat on your steady palm
Saying every storm that finds us learns to turn to calm
All the roads kept folding back
To the place we thought we'd lost if
Love is just a simple act
Let's pay the little cost
Velvet weather hearts get better
Pages turning back together
Take my hand and hold it steady
I am falling when you're ready
Velvet weather saying never let me go again, not ever
Soft and sure as drifting heather, velvet weather
Velvet weather
I kept lists of little losses tucked inside my sleep
But your laugh untied the corners taught my shadow how to breathe
You said every broken rhythm has a place to land
And the night began to open like an easy plan
All the signs we used to miss
Bloomed across the dark like sparks
This home is just the shape of this
Let's live inside its marks
Velvet weather hearts get better pages
Turn it back together
Take my hand and hold it steady
I am falling when you're ready baby
Velvet weather, say it never, let me go again, not ever
Soft and sure as drifting heather, velvet weather, velvet weather
If the wind remembers names, let it carry ours
If the dawn is kind to love, we'll count the quiet stars
We don't have to run forever just to feel the light
Sometimes staying is the bravest thing we do tonight
Oh, velvet weather (velvet weather)
Breathe it in together
Velvet weather, hearts get better
Pages turning back together
Take my hand and hold it steady
I'm yours and I am ready
Velvet weather, say it never
Let me go again, not ever
Every step, a softer tether
Velvet weather, velvet weather
Leave the suitcase by the door, let the thunder rest
In the hush between our breaths, we find the truest yes
Velvet weather here and now, wonder open skies
Love begins where wonder ends
And the echo dies
