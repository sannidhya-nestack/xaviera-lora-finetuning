I found your secret hideaway
In a place where you keep all of your hate arrayed
And you plot for world domination
One that starts with my degradation
Why do you believe
That you rise to apple degrees?
By stepping on me, too busy trying to pull me down
You proved me see, no one else was around
Had you all over scheme, well I'm just gonna bug out
And have fun and live life and have love and bug out
I will no longer allow your hate to come and take me away
I'm just on a bb and I'm just gonna bug out and have fun and live life and have love and bug out
I've got a solution
If you cannot beat us, join our revolution
the bitterness that surrounds you
It's the bitterness that will drown you
you, you know you'll never succeed
If you're moved by envy and greed
You're stepping on me, too busy trying to hold me down
You thought you'd see no one else was around
That you were the only scheme
Well I'm just gonna bug out and have fun and live life and have love and bug out
I will no longer allow your hate to come and take me away
I know you know you'll never succeed
If to rise you step on me
Yeah, yeah
Too busy trying to hold me down
You couldn't see no one else was around
As you wallow in steam
Well, I'm just gonna bug out and have fun
And live life and have love and et
I will no longer allow your hate
To come and take me away
I'm just gonna be me and I'm just gonna bug out and have fun and live life and have love and bug out
Bug out and have fun and live life and have love and bug out
