On the run to fly away
Bring my love back home
I used to search myself in mirrors of my life
Down around the road to anywhere
Standing in front of you, things I left behind
Someday this broken heart will heal
You help me through the night
There's nothing we can do
Reflections in my mind
There's a road to go through
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home to stay
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home
And tell me what it takes to take you home
I wanna know how everything went wrong
You've been far from turning back
You held me through the night
There's nothing we can do
Reflections in my mind
There's a road to go through
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home to stay
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home to stay
All the world to fly away
Bring my love back home to stay
