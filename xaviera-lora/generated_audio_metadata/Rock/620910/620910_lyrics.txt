Watching, I'm focusing my view as you are walking
You're lighting up the room and I am hoping
The blue that's in your eyes will meet with mine
We'll take our backs off both the walls
Another step closer to the truth
That you and I were meant to find
All the answers to our clues
Cause it's eleven, eleven and we got one wish
Put the pieces together make sure all of this will come true
Will come true
You're so calm, so cool and collected
But so tired, so down and retracted
What if I said
All of this could change tonight
So think back, have you ever had the chance at
Standing in the spotlight
now's your time to shine
Step out of line and leave it all behind
Waiting
On tripping over moves as you are facing
Across the floor but you're not sure what to do
I'm dying to know if I deserve the one who
You're the only one who's lighting up the room
You're so calm, so cool and collected
But so tired, so down and rejected
What if I said
All of this could change tonight
So think back, have you ever had the chance at
Standing in the spotlight
It's not your time to shine
Just step out of line and leave it all behind
Just leave it all behind
I've been waiting and I'm debating whether I'm getting through to you
I've been waiting and I'm debating whether I'm getting through to you
You're so calm, so cool, like cool like dad
But so tired, so down, I'd retract it
What if I said
All of this could change tonight
So think back, have you ever had the chance at
Standing in the spotlight?
It's not your time to shine
Just step out of line and leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
