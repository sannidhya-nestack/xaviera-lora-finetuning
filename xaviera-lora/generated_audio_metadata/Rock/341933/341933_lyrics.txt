And it keeps going on and on
Yeah, like a lonesome river all night long
And the rain keeps falling
On and on
On and on
On and on, on and on
It's too late to let me
It's too late to let me
It's too late to let me down
It's too late to let me down
I've got one foot in the ground
Why can't you just set me free if you know it's not me
You're where you wanna be but it's on and on
Yeah, never once relenting all night long
And the train keeps rolling on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
