Now
Gotta get to you right now
Bright lights, I'm living loud
Everybody's going down
My head keeps spinning round, round and round
You say you want me, you got me, tell me what you'd do to me now
It's Sin City
I know you want me, you got me
Tell me what should you do to me now
It's Sin City, Sin, Sin City
Sin City, Sin, Sin City
Let's go, let's get it on and get to the show
I got the feeling I'm losing control
And we'll lose, I gotta know, I gotta know
Are you ready to roll,'cause I'm ready to go
You say you want me, you got me, you tell me what to do, let me know
It's insanity, yeah you want me, you got me
Tell me what you do to me now
It's insanity, I know you want me, you got me
Tell me how it's all going down
It's insanity, I know you want me, you got me
Tell me what you do to me now
It's San City, San, San City, San City, San, San City
You say you want me, you got me
Tell me what you do to me now
It's incident, I know you want me, you got me
Tell me what you do to me now
It's incident, I know you want me, you got me
Tell me how it's all going down
It's incident, I know I want it, you got it
Tell me that you're doing it now
It's insanity, insanity, insanity, insanity
You got me, you got me
