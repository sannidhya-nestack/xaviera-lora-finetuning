Tonight all the world's asleep by the fireside
But I'm lost and walking home in the pale moonlight
Tonight the scent of you in the air
Is taking me back to where we met
And I don't wanna go home
Love, when I wake up I see your face
I hear your voice in silences
I read your mind when you're not here
No matter how far or near
And I'm just bringing hope to life
I just miss you so and I'm
I'm lost, wandering'round in a daze
That you help create
I'm tired of tired, I might now escape
And tonight, all the stars light up in a perfect sky
But I
Can't get past the fact that you said goodbye
Tonight, the light is clouded by rain
Taking me back to when you left
Now I don't wanna go home
Loathe, I hear your whisper as the wind
Your love is every sea I swim
Your every thought up in my mind
No matter how hard I try and I
Just bringing hope to life
I just miss you so and I'm lost
Wandering round in a day
That you helped create
I'm tired, I'm tired, I might now escape
And I don't wanna hold this new feeling I found
Inconsolable pain and fear
And I don't see the future when you're not around
now that you're gone it's not real
Lord, when I wake up I see your face
I hear your voice in silences
I read your mind when you're not here
No matter how far or near
I'm just bringing hope to life
I just miss you so and I
I'm lost wandering round in a daze
That you helped create and I
I'm just bringing hope to life
I just miss you so and I
Wandering round in a day that you helped create
Tired of tired I might now escape tonight, tonight, tonight
