Alone together, chaos reigns outside
In the distance, the city streets run wild
This place has never been my friend
I know that is when
When I reach for your heart again
Holding on through the night
Safe in my arms again
Nothing could be more right
Than when I'm in love to you
Baby we come alive, we come alive
We come alive
I close the window, breathe the final sigh
Beneath the street lights, discarded paper lies
This place will never be my friend
Maybe this will end
When I reach for your heart again
Holding on through the night
Safe in my arms again
Nothing could be more right
Now when I make love to you
Baby we come alive
We come alive
We come alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I reach for your heart again
Holding on through the night
Safe in my arms again
Nothing could be more right
And when I make love to you
Baby we come alive
Oh we come alive
We come alive
I reach for your heart again
Holding on through the night
Saving my arms again
Nothing could be more right
Not when I'm this close to you
