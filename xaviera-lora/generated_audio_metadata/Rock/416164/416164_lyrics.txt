She drives an old truck, it's a blue Chevrolet
She keeps her hair tied in long velvet braids
Kicked at her old man, they burned all his clothes
Now she goes dancing all alone
And she likes it that way
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Flat on the wind
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Riding on the edge
A wild woman
She's tattooed from her head to her toes
And she sleeps all day
Walks around naked with her pair of boots on
Just so the neighbors can see
And she likes it that way
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Flying on the wind
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Riding on the edge
Wild women
They want to tie you down
By walking you down the aisle
With a bouquet of flowers
And a little white gown
You're gonna be wild
She works down at the depot
For the graveyard shift animals
They don't know much about her
But they all call out her name
And she likes it that way
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Flying on the wind
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Riding on the edge
Wild, wild women
Know how to live
Flying on the wind
Wild, wild women know how to live right on the edge, wild women
