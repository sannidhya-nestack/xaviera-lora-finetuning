You laugh out loud at what I told you
While we're splashing in the rain
I love to see you smiling back at me
And hope it's not a dream
You let me know there'll be more days like this
Sweet sweet sugar be good to me
And I will promise
I'll give you nothing but everything
I'll give you nothing but everything
Your candy kisses in the morning
Make way for the sun to rise
Smooth like honey in the evening
Makes me feel alive
You let me know
There'll be more days like this
Sweet sweet sugar be good to me
And I will grow on there
I'll give you nothing but everything
I'll give you nothing but everything, ooh
You let me know there'll be more days like this
Sweet, sweet sugar be good to me
And I will promise
I'll give you nothing but everything
I'll give you nothing but everything, ooh-ooh-ooh
Everything
Nothing but everything
I'll give you nothing but everything
Nothing but everything
Everything
Nothing but everything (nothing but everything)
I'll give you nothing but everything (nothing but everything)
Nothing but everything
