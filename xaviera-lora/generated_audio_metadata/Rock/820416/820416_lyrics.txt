Lost in the fire alone
I feel every heartbeat
Thirty miles like I'm driving a storm
Thirty miles on the concrete
You know she's out on the horizon
Hanging high over the land
She's the sun in the evening
Slipping right out of my hand
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
Heaven I don't have a love
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
Heaven I don't have a love
Into the desert
I am nodding out in the cold
Though my soul won't surrender
Oh yeah
My heart wants a little control
A little control out on the horizon
Clouds hang over clear
She's the sun in the evening
Holding breath watch her disappear
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
Heaven I don't know how to love
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
I ain't ready now to let her go
Heaven I don't know how to love
Chasing the lightning, waiting for the sky to spark
Knowing the thunder's waiting for me in the dark
Chasing the lightning, waiting for the sky to spark
Knowing the thunder's waiting for me in the dark
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Chasing lightning waiting for the sky to spark
Knowing thunder is waiting for me in the dark
Chasing lightning waiting for the sky to spark
Knowing thunder is waiting for me in the dark
Chasing the light but waiting for the sky to fall
Knowing you'll find me just waiting for the end of the world
Chasing the light but waiting for the sky to fall
Knowing you'll find me just waiting for the end of the world
Chasing lightning, waiting for the skies to fall
No one found me, was waiting for me in the dark
