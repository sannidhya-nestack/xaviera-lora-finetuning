Riding my bike up the same old hill
Never made it to the top, today I will
And if I fall and scrape my knee
Won't let the asphalt get to me
And as I get up off the ground
I brush myself off and look around
It'll only hurt for a little while
As we go through life, we get our bumps and bruises
No matter which game we play, somebody always loses
Something goes wrong, and the pain lingers on
But it only hurts for a little while
I thought I met my love last week
I waited by the phone but it didn't ring
Now everyone's got somebody to love
But baby it takes two to feel like one
Turn out the lights and hit the sack
And though the pillow won't hug me back
It's only gonna hurt for a little while
As we go through life we get our bumps and bruises
No matter which game we play somebody always loses
Something goes wrong and the pain lingers on
But it only hurts for a little while
You know it only hurts for a little while
Oh yeah
Something goes wrong, and the pain lingers on
All grown up and moved away, I got a call from my mother today
Now when are you gonna leave that man?
You gonna fall on your knees or take a stand?
I can't believe this happens to me
She said this only happens on TV
But it'll only hurt for a little while
It's just like she said
As we roll through life we get all bumps and bruises
No matter which game we play, somebody always loses
Something goes wrong and the pain lingers on
But it only hurts for a little while
You know it only hurts
Riding my bike up the same old hill
Never made it to the top, today I will
