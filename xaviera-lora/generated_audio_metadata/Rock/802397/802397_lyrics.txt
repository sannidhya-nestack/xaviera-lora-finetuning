Doesn't matter what you think of, what you think of me
Don't be clever, put the phone down, everything is clear
Make yourself at home and pull it through the end of time
Let it go, all of the things we'll have to say before I go
Doesn't matter your sensation, are you kidding me?
What a clever conversation
I never want to meet
Don't lose your sleep tonight
Just be yourself again
And with some love you'll find another bed
Make yourself at home and pull it through the hand of time
Let it go, all of the things we'll have to say before I go
Turn around, leave the clowns, tell the people what have you done
Look at you on the move feeling lonely feeling blue
I hope you stay that way
Don't lose your sleep tonight
Just be yourself again
And with some love you'll find
Another bed
Make yourself at home and pull it through the end of times
You can make yourself at home and pull it through the end of time
Let it go all of the things you have to say before I go
