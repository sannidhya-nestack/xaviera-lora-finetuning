Well I come from Alabama
With a banjo on my neck
And I'm bound for Louisiana
My own true love for to see
Well it rained all night the day that we left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot
That I nearly froze myself
Susanna don't you break down and cry
And I said oh, oh Susanna
No, don't you cry for me, no
I come from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
Well it rained all night
The day we left
And the weather was born dry
The sun was so hot
And I nearly froze myself
Susanna don't you break down and cry
And I said oh
Oh, Susanna, now don't you cry for me
I come from Alabama with this banjo
This bad girl
On my knees
