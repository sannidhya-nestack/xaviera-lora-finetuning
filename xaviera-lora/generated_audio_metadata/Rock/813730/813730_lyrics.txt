She says, "It's over"
But I'm not about to say my goodbyes
I can't let go of a good thing
Cause I'm nothing like them, rest of these guys
So throw me around if you want to
Scream if you want to
And tear me apart at the seams if you want to, um
She says it's over
But I'm not about to say it's alright
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
And everything will be alright
It's just a bad day
And she can get that way more often than not
And I'll take my chances
She don't like my answers
But it's all that I got
So throw me around if you want to
Scream if you want to
And tear me apart at the seams if you want to
Oh, she says it's over
But I'm not about to say my goodbyes
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
And everything will be alright
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
And I'll be there to take you home
And I like you when you're not so insane
And I like you when you're calling me names
It's overblown, I'm not that sure
If either one is right or wrong
I'm not that annoying, I'll keep waiting for you, I'll be just fine
When the crazy comes through
If one of us is right, then one of us is wrong
It's all just timing in the end
And if one of us is right, then none of this is wrong
It's all just timing in the end
And she says, "It's over, but I'm not about to say my goodbyes"
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
Everything will be alright
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
And I'll be there to take you home
Hold on (be waiting) hold on
Hold on and be waiting for a knock at the door
And I'll be there to take you home
