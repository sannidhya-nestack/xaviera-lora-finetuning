We dance in the wheat fields in the night
By the black stone lake under moonlight
We dance by the fire as it speaks
Dance for the strong and for the weak
Come up with me now, come up with me now, come up with me now
Come up with me now, come up with me now, come up with me now
We dance by the street lights under rain
By the Bay Ridge River train
We dance for the ghost in the summer sun
We are mighty and we are one
Come up with me now, come up with me now, come up with me now
Come up with me now, come up with me now, come up with me now
Come up with me now, come up with me now, come up with me now
At the edge of the ocean as it breathes
Heavenly like a monster in its sleep
Silent and still in the twilight
We'll sing our songs at the sunrise
Race through the trees as the day warms
Chased by the warmth of the summer storms
We are the daughters and the sons
We are the daughters and the sons
Come up with me now, come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
Come up with me now
