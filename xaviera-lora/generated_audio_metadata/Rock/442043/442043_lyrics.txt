Let's go!
I'm a fastback, supertrack, moving machine
Flow by the flow, got a floating scene
With the wink of an eye and the blink of a light
I'm a high speed lover, make you feel alright
Let's go!
Out on the road again
Are you ready? Come on little honey
Driving me to the end
Burning down the street with my 406
Turning'round the corner, gonna get my kicks
Pedal to the floor, I'm the 405, I got a thrill for you
Come down with me tonight, let's go
Out on the road again
Don't be crazy, come on, baby, baby
Never come back again
Let's go
Ooh, oh
Prove out of the way
Prove out of the way, yeah
Get out of my hood way
Let's go
Ooh yeah yeah let's go out on the road again
Are you ready come on little honey I'm driving you to the end
Ooh yeah let's go let's go out on the road again
Don't be crazy, come on, pretty baby
Never come back together, yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
Let's go
Let's go
Ooh yeah, let's go, yeah
Ooh yeah, let's go, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
It'll come back
