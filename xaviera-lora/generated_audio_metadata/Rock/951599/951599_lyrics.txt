I ain't letting go of these feelings
Hold me back
Yeah they hold me down
And I won't stand to be
Kicked upon, stood up
Or lay her down
You will start to say another side to me
So strong, yet so cold
And in my mind you'll be another part of history
Don't push my buttons man, I'm liable to explode
You know I'm tired feeling the same way
Depression sets in and I'm living in yesterday
But today I'm angry and it feels good
To be alive, it's so alive
I can finally see another side of me
It's so alive, it's so alive
I am letting go of these people
They hold me back
They won't hold me down
And I won't stand to be victimized
Walked on
Or pushed around
You will start to see a new side of me
It will be strong
And it will be real cold
And in my heart I'll say what's become of me
You pushed my buttons man it's time to explode
You know I'm tired I'm not feeling anything
There is no tomorrow there is no yesterday
I am angry and it feels good to be alive
It's so alive
I can finally see another side to me
It's so alive
It's so alive
You know I'm tired, I'm not feeling anything
There is no tomorrow, there is no yesterday
Today I'm angry, and it feels good
To be alive, so alive
I can finally see another side of me
It's so alive, it's so alive
Don't you know I'm angry
And it feels good to be alive
I am so alive
I can finally see another side of me
That's so alive
I am so alive
