Do you ever feel this way
That you lost your time
Got a fever for today
Keep me awake at night
Come on come on with me
Stay around
Stay around and scrape down'til you see
Pull me down
Pull me down and hey
We're acquiring senses
So high
I want more
Trying to explain
Then you lost your time
Even there's no one to blame
Everybody knows the crime
Come on, come on with me
Stay around, stay around
And straight down'til you see
Pull me down, pull me down
And hey, we're quiet dancers
Somehow, I want more
We are so something, oh for God sake
Check my pulse and I'm still alive
It's an endless search
All we got is hurt
And we need to survive and hey
We're acquiring sensors
So high
I want more
And hey, we're quiet instances
Somehow, I want more
Somehow I want more
Somehow I want more, more, more, more
