I can't get out of bed
My hands are spinning carousel
Twirling a new thread
Setting up a wishing well
I'm shedding a new skin
Thinning out and feeling swell
I smell the scent of sin
We should never kiss and tear
The illusions in my mind, in my mind
Cuddle me at night, cuddle me at night
The illusions in my head, in my head
A picture perfect sight
Of all the things I should have said and never said
All these illusions in my head
It's such an even flow, never leave a stone unturned
I'm learning as I go, that even stones can leave a burn
I'm hurting and it shows, who knows if the scars will fade
I've made myself a hole, a lonely soul who's lost his way
The illusions in my mind, in my mind
Cuddled me at night, cuddled me at night
These illusions in my head, in my head
A picture perfect sight of all the things I should have said and never said
All these illusions in my head
All these illusions in my head
I didn't think that I'd be standing over here
What an island I've become
So far away from where I always used to be
But I won't turn around, turn around
Turn around
The illusions in my mind, in my mind
Cuddle me at night, cuddle me at night
The illusions in my head, in my head
A picture perfect sight
Of all the things I should've said and never said
All these illusions in my head
All these illusions in my head
Illusions in my head
