I'd like to see ya maybe later maybe sooner
Alligator'cause you're red hot
Mama that you can't deny
We better cool this little thing girl before it comes a raging fire
La-dee-da-da
La-dee-da-da
Well now you're choking, now you're smoking
Now you're choking, now you're smoking
But you're red hot
Mama that you can't deny
We gotta cool this little thing girl
Before it comes a raging fire
Cause you're red hot
Yes, your red heart
Your red heart
Hey
'Cause you're red hot
Yes, you're red hot
You're red hot
Hey, I'd like to see ya
Maybe later, maybe sooner
In the shower, oh, your red hot
Mama that you can't deny
We better cool this little thing, girl
Before it comes a raging fire
We gotta cool this little thing girl before it comes a raging fire
