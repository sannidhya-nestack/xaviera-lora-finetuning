No sensation
No cruel twist of fate, no limitation
For no time is too late, no beginnings
Or endings to contrive
There's heaven
And a chance to come alive, come alive
No sensation
There's no cause to embrace, no limitation
To life, time, no space, no deceiving
I was given to receive, there's heaven
And a reason to believe
Playful for time
You took your time, time, time
No, no sensation
There's no wise words to voice
No limitation
Of chains, chance, no choice
No peacemaker could ever pacify my mind
There's heaven in the swelling sands of time
I'm alive, I'm dead
I'm alive
