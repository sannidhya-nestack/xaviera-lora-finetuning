I've met a hundred people
Some might say that I've found
And they were all bad pennies
That adds up to a pound
Once I knew a couple
That I have sadly lost
To me they were much dealer
I still can't count the cost
Life is like a movie
With actors that you know
A plot that seems quite groovy
Director that won't show
And those left in the picture
They don't know how it ends
They just pray for a sequel
Guess it all depends
Life is like a movie
With actors that you know
A plot that seems quite groovy
Director that won't show
