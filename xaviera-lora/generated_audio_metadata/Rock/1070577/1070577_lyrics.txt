I know that some of us are searching
And some of us have given up
Whether you're heading for a wedding or funeral
Hope springs eternal
We're all windows shopping for love
Some say that they don't think about it
Maybe it's time we call their bluff
'Cause you know baby when we get down to brass tacks
Here are the straight facts
We're out our window shopping for love
You may be richer than King Minus
You may be down to your last buck
It doesn't matter you're a miser or gambler or midnight rambler
We're all window shopping for love
I know you've had your fill of heartache
Threw up your hands and cried enough
It makes no difference if you're sane or you're crazy
Lonesome or lazy
We're all window shopping for love
All window shopping, all window shopping
We're all window shopping for love (love)
All window shopping, all window shopping
We're all window shopping for love
You may have sold your soul to Satan
You may pray to God above
It doesn't matter, you're a sinner, a sinner
Loser, winner, oh, we're no shoppin' for love
They have been thrown out of Eden
When things had started gettin' rough
You may be on the road to hell or to heaven
Or even death, ah yeah
We're all windowshopping for love
All windows shoppin'
All windows shoppin'
All windows shoppin'
For love (love)
All windows shoppin'
All windows shoppin'
We're all windows shoppin' for love
You may have soldiers, swords, or satans
All windows shoppin'
We're all windows shoppin'
Love, love, love
All windows shopping
All windows shopping
We're all windows shopping for love
All window shopping
All window shopping
We're all window shopping for love
All window shopping
All window shopping
We're all window shopping for love
You may have sold your soul to satan
All window shopping
We're all window shopping for love
All window shopping
I'll be shopping for love
