I have wandered through the silence, chasing after time
Every road becomes a circle, every mountain climbs
In the distance there's a beacon breaking through the night
Guiding me to something brighter, pulling me to life
Every step is written in the skies
Every turning star reflects your eyes
Horizons in your eyes
I can't look away
The future is a fire where the shadows fade
Horizons in your eyes
Calling out my name, I'm falling, I'm rising, I'll never be the same
Moments fall like ancient rivers, carrying me fast
Through the echoes and the questions, nothing ever lasts
But your voice becomes the anchor steady through the storm
And the chaos in the silence will keep me warm
Every path is bending into view
Every open door is leading you
Horizons in your eyes
I can't look away
The future is a fire where the shadows fade
Horizons in your eyes calling out my name
I'm falling, I'm rising, I'll never be the same
Even when the night is endless
Even when the stars collide
Every dream becomes relentless
When I see your light, light, light
Take me where the dawn begins
Where the endless sky is there
Horizons in your eyes, I can't look away
The future is a fire where the shadows fade
Horizons in your eyes, calling out my name
I'm falling, I'm rising, I'll never be the same
Horizons in your eyes
I'll never be the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
