Well, an angel told me a long, long time ago
That angel told me a long long time ago
Well you better spend it while you can
Can't take it with you when you go
So I've been a sitting around thinking man
How to keep everything I own
Yeah, I've been a-sittin' around thinkin' man
How to keep everything on
But it ain't no loose tryin'
You can't take it with you when you go
Oh I'm gonna back up my guitar in my dining floor
And tell all my buddies and all the girls that I know
Ain't no use waiting I know
Judgment day or what's up
Boy you can't take it with you when you go
You can't take it with you when you go
No no you ain't gonna need it way down below
Boy you can't take it with you when you go
Oh, you can't take it with you where you go
You can't take it with you where you go
No, no, you ain't gonna need it way down below
You can't take it with you where you go
Oh, tell me about it
Mmm, how'bout my guitar? (Can't take it with you)
What about my Cuban cigars? (Can't take it with you)
What about my Kansas City Chiefs hat? (Can't take it with you)
How'bout my gold tooth? (Can't take it with you)
What about my beer bottle collection? (Can't take it with you)
What about my'76 Chevy pickup truck? (Can't take it with you)
How'bout my tattoo of Elvis?
Can't take it with you
Not even my soul whoopee records
Can't take it with you
What about Bernadette?
Well you can't take it with you when you go
You can't take it with you when you go
You can't take it with you when you go
Oh you can't take it with you when you go
No you can't take it with you
You can't take it with you
When you can't take it with you
Like you can't take it with you
No, no, you ain't gonna need it way down, you know
You can't take it with you, let it go
