I just need to say to you, to get it off my mind
And hope it might be easier to pass the time
Cause things we had they're fading fast, and love has turned to pain
Life is fragile like a glass, and seasons change
If I catch your eye
And something burns inside
Stars fill the sky
Don't pass me by
I lie awake alone at night
And dream I hold your hand
Two lovers strolling in the dark
We understand
Each other from the day we met
Our destinies entwined
But here I lie alone again
Torn up in time
If I catch your eye
And something burns inside
Stars fill the sky
And boat paces me by
You know I haven't heard from you
But I hear you're doing fine
Funny how the things we miss
Get lost inside
I'm packing up the things I own
I'm gonna leave my love behind
Road ahead is all I got
And too much time
If I catch your eye
And something burns inside
Stars fill the sky
Don't pass me by
Don't pass me by
Don't pass me by
