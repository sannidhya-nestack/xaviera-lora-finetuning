Setting it up with always such confusion
Always topple games, it has to be now
It's nothing new, makes you feel so alive
All sense is nowhere, took it this far
Someone will pay, you're just unreal
No damage for now, I can't believe a single word that you say
Your cover has been blown, I see right through you
I swear you're making it up, yeah I've heard it all sure gets around
I swear you're making it up, well truthfully it's what you do
Hello, so long
In the end you just don't have a clue
Won't play along
Never wanted anything from you
Can't stand it another day
You'll find something to cry about
A grown-up going on twelve years old
Your own set of rules
I can't solve the riddle
It's half time for you and need repair
The creature you are, target you prey
What big ordeal
No damage for now, I can't believe a single word that you say
Your cover has been blown, I see right through you
I swear you're making it up, yeah I've heard it all sure gets around
I swear you're making it up, well truthfully it's what you do
Hello, so long, in the end you just don't have a clue
Won't play along, never wanted anything from you
I swear you're making it up
Yeah, I've heard it all, sure gets the round
I swear you're making it up
Well truthfully, it's what you do
Hello, just a little bit of sunshine
In the end you just don't have a clue
Won't play along
Never wanted anything from you
Never wanted anything from you
