Soft kick warm chords breath held wide
Two voices ready for the ride
He drew a pulse I could follow blind
A quiet sign that settled my mind
Every doubt lost weight and slipped
Every fear unclenched its grip
I felt the floor turn into springs
The little sparks and simple things
When you lean close the room grows kind
Every note says you are mine
Let the verses climb and glide
Step by step our hearts in stride
If the waves grow bold and high
We'll keep singing you and I
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in
Feel that lift, let the rhythm win
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in
Sing it back, let the light pour in
One, two, three, we begin again
Say you're in, I'm all in
You turn a whisper into steel
Build small bridges we can feel
Little truths, no grand parade
Still they move the world we've made
You found the mark beneath my skin
Tapped a gate and drew me in
When the room falls, still and small, you're the chord behind it all
Let the verses climb and glide, step by step, our hearts in stride
If the waves grow bold and high, we'll keep singing, you and I
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in, feel that lift, let the rhythm win
Say you're in
I'm all in, all in
Sing it back, let the light pour in
One, two, breathe, we begin again
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in
Change the key and tilt the view
Open doors, we're walking through
Count it off and take the lead
Every step, the song we need
Turn the page, we won't look down
Set our feet on brighter ground
All in (say you're in)
All in (let it spin)
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in
Feel that lift, let the rhythm win
Say you're in, I'm all in, all in
Sing it back, let the light pour in
One, two, breathe, we begin again
Say you're in, I'm all in
Soft kick fades, chords slow the run
Two voices land as one
