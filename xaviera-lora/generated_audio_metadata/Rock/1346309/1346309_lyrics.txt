The younger kids will now be older
And no one will party to this song
The younger kids will now be older
And no one will party to this song
And I don't know why no one wants to grow old
When you've been growing old every single day
And I don't know why no one wants to get old
When you've been growing old every single day
Nothing's really changed now, no
And I don't know a lot about politicians
But I'm all for green parties
And I don't know where to look
When I see you people, you're dead
Dreaming it seeming impossible
To think logical on how you're living your life
Okay and I don't know a lot about everything
But I know what I love and that's enough to say for me
What about the rest of you?
