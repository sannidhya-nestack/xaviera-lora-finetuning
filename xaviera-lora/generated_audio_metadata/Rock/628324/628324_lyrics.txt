Time, like a revelation
You keep standing in the spotlight right where you fall in the ground
Time, for a piece of the action
Cold in despair now my head keeps turning around
Lies, from a new temptation
Rather be the change than the wish of breaking free
It's a crime on my own salvation
You can always have the chance to find what you really need
Singing alright in the middle of the night
Okay, I walk down on my way
Alright, I don't need no reason why
Change, change, always calling out my name
Here I am again, walking down the pool of fire of love
Life, life is getting faster
With the eyes of your dreams
We can try to start the train
Ooh, sighs in the rear view mirror
Like the rolling of the dice
Is the way my brain will gain
Sing it all right
In the middle of the night
Okay
Walking down my way
All right
Don't need no reason why
Change (change)
Always calling out my name (name)
Here I am again
Walking down the pool of our love
Lay (lay) lay my hands into the flames (flames)
Here I stand again, walking down the pool and find all that
I've loved (oh yeah)
All right
Okay
All right
Whoa
In the middle of the night
But I won't wait here
I don't need no reason why
Change
Always calling out my name
Here I am again
Walking down the boulevard of love
Lay, lay my hands into the flames
I've been walking down the boulevard of love
Walking down the boulevard of love
Of love, of love
Change
