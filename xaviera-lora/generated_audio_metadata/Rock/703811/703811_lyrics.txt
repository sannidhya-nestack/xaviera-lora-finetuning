Meet me out at midnight
In the twilight for a stroll
No one else can see us
We'll be timeless, fresh and bold
Your touch is a secret
The passion will unfold
I'll be waiting
I am patient
Yeah, shaking, baby, over you
I'll be waiting, rebellic in blue
Take you for some dancing to a little place that's closed
Folks that mind the matters, they got a house band down that smokes
Well take that corner booth for certain, and there's something you should know
When Bobby bangs the big drum, it's Johnny go go go go go
And I can't last forever
you say you must go
And I think I caught a fever
I'm waiting to explode
Hang on hon, we're leaving
Just kiss me once we're slow
And I'll be waiting
Impatient
Yeah, I'm shaking, baby, over you
I'll be waiting with the Pelican Blues
I'll be waiting with the Pelican Blues
I'll be waiting with the Pelican Blues
