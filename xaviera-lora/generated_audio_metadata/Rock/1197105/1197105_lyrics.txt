There's a fire running up and down my leg
Heaps rising, false signals through my head
My left foot getting heavier every day
Blacktop road calling out my name
Keep that motor running
Come on, can you feel that engine of mad?
There's a fire burning deep inside
Come on baby, while we're still alive
At the blacktop road, screaming demon
The screaming demon
Battle to the floor, we're moving too slow
This is what I know, just down the road
Think I'm gonna stop, refusing company
Come on baby hop inside and take a ride with me
Keep that motor running
Come on, did you feel that engine rumble?
There's a wild burning deep inside
Come on, baby, while I'm still alive
I'm a black top, broke, screaming demon
Love screaming demon
Deep black mode of running
Come on, can't you feel that engine humming?
There's a fire burning deep inside
Come on baby, while we're still alive
I'm the black top of broke skinny demon
The skinny demon
The skinny demon
Everyone around here all know my name
Every long town all knows my game
Come on baby, it's a heavy load
Just keep on running, it's the only way I know
Keep that motor running
Come on, don't you feel that it's just romance
And the fire's burning deep inside
Come on baby, while it's still alive
I'm the black side of the road screaming demon
The screaming demon
The screaming demon
The screaming demon
Just give me a minute
