You don't have to speak
I hear you say
When I kiss your cheek and
You turn away
Oh, every day
Oh, the games you play
you don't have the heart
You don't have the heart to say
You don't have the heart
You don't have the heart
You don't have to look into my eyes
I've spent so many years reading your mind
Ooh
I don't know why you still deny it
But you don't have the heart
You don't have the heart to try it
You don't have the heart
You don't have the heart
And the clock keeps tickin' time
This side's yours and this side's mine
You don't have to speak
I hear you say
When I kiss your cheek and
You turn away
Ooh
Everyday ooh
We get farther away
Cause we don't have the heart
We don't have the heart to say it
We don't have the heart
We don't have the heart
We don't have the heart
We don't have the heart
