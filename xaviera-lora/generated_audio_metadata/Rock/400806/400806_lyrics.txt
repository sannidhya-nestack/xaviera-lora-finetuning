Well, you wonder now and then about choices
Before and after and remember why you're driven
Why those images still remain
And you look up in the night sky
Seems darker than before
In the moonlight paint your picture
And you shake hands with destiny
All those pictures seal your fate never break
Still memories in time and the closed minds
The images remain, the images remain
It always stays the same, it always stays the same
All those pictures seal your fate, never break
Still memories in time and the closed minds and the images
Always in your mind
Never easy
You're my jazz
