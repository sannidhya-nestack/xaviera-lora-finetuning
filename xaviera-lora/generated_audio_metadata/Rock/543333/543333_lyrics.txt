She's settling in, she's settling down
Settling for less with the one she's found
Not turning away, she be turning grey
Learning to stay with the one she's found
But she's down, so down, so
'Cause she don't wanna be alone
She wants to leave but she won't go
she can't make it on her own
It's not a world she wants
So she's settling, she's settling
When she could do so much better than him
She's settling, she's settling
When she could do so much better
She's out with me, he's home asleep
But still his love she wants to keep
And I'm trying to stay, I'm trying to wave
But she just won't take that leap of faith
So I'm down, so down, so down
'Cause I don't wanna be alone, I wanna leave, but I won't go
I can't make it on my own, it's not a world I wanna know
And while she's settling, while she's settling
She knows I'd be much better than him
She's settling, while she's settling
She knows I'd be much better
Yeah, I'm not settling, I'm not settling
I'm not settling, I'm not settling
Oh, I'm not settling, I'm not settling
I'm not settling
