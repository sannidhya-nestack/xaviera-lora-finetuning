I'm looking out my window, well, it's cold and grey
Think I'm gonna need somebody's help
To chase those blues away
Gonna cross that muddy water
To the dark side of town
Gonna cross that muddy river
My life just going round
You know I'm gonna see my friend Charlie
He's gonna make it a party
Mr. Brown comes round to bring you down
It's all going on here round and round
Gonna cross that muddy water
To the dark side of town
But when I cross that river
Don't kick me when I'm down
Cross that muddy water
Cross that muddy water
Cross that muddy water
Cross that muddy water
So here I am
Looking out of my window
Sky so cold and grey
Please make these blues go away
Make these blues go away
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
Crossing over the river
