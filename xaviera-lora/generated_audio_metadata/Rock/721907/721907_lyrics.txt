I'm knee deep in the water
And the river's on the rise
I'm knee deep in the water
And the river's on the rise
The levee broke this morning
Under dark and heavy skies
Mmm, the levee broke this morning
After days of pouring rain
The levee broke this morning
After days of pouring rain
It washed away the highway
Wish it could have washed away my pain
My pain
Oh, it's washing away
Take my pain, take my pain
It washed away the highway
So I'm moving to higher ground
It washed away the highway
Now I'm moving to higher ground
But I'm knee deep in the water
And the river's rising all around
Oh, the levee broke this morning
After days of driving rain
The levee broke this morning
After days of driving rain
It left nothing there behind it
Oh, but it didn't take away my pain
Didn't take away my pain
Take it, oh come on, take away my pain
I don't want it anymore
Take it away, take it away, wash it down the drain
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh yeah, mm, ooh
You know it's raining in my heart
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
