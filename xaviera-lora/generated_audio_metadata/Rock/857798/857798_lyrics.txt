I got cold sweats and a hole in my mind
Cold, cold, cold sweats and a storm in my mind
And I can't recall my name
My limbs are turning lame
I got cold sweats
A hole in my mind
I got a fever
Bloodshot eyes
I got a fever
And a fire in my eyes
And I can't walk up the stairs
I'm running out of air
I got a fever
And bloodshot eyes
I got a hunger
And I can't quench my thirst
I've got a hunger
And it can't get much worse
I can't ask for this now
But I'll beg you for it later
I've got a hunger
And it's all in your hands
