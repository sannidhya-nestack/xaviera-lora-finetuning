Way up, way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up
We were so young
But I didn't know it then
We had it all
I'm trying to remember when
We were so close, so close
Yet so far away up, way up, way up, way up
Whistle, way up, way up, way up, way up
Let's go, take my hand
Don't let go
We're up, we're up, we're up, we're up
We're so, we're up, we're up, we're up, we're up
We're forever young
Here we go
How did you know
That I'm the only one for you
And the man in the moon
Was shining down on me and you
We were so close, so close
Yet so far away up, way up, way up, way up
Whistle, way up, way up, way up, way up
Let's go, click my hand
Don't let go
Way up, way up, way up, way up
We're so, way up, way up, way up, way up
We're forever young
Here we go
I don't know what's wrong or right
I only know as long as I'm with you
We'll find our way to the sky
And run away way up way up high
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up, way up, way up
Whistle, way up, way up, way up, way up
Let's go, take my hand
Don't let go
Way up, way up, way up, way up
Whistle, way up, way up, way up, way up
We're forever young
Here we go
Wait up, wait up, wait up, wait up
Wait up, wait up, wait up, wait up
We're forever young
Here we go
