I've been waiting all week long
For Friday night and her sweet song
A whiskey drink and a wild child too
We're gonna dance and sing the blues
Oh, I'm feeling alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman taking over the land
We'll be some hell and have a real good time
Oh, make some memories that'll last all night
She walks in with a swag and a stride
And my attention like a wild ride
We're talking loud and laughing free
Got our drinks up in our hands in the air you see
We're living life like we ain't never gonna die
Got our own style and our own vibe
Oh, I'm feelin' alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman takin' over the land
We'll race some hell and have a real good time
Gonna make some memories that'll last all night
I'm still alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman taking over the land
We're gonna race some hell and have a real good time
Oh, make some memories that'll last all night
That'll last all night
Oh, I'm feeling alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman taking over the land
We'll make some hell and have a real good time
Gonna make some memories that'll last all night
Yeah, listen up, let me share a tale
We're two rebels living life on the edge
Our whiskey-fueled nights are the stuff of legends, yeah
We're chasing the high, the good times too
Our wild adventures are the stories we hope true
We're the kings and queens of this crazy life
We're writing our own rules and we ain't never saying goodbye (we're the rats who never will learn)
And the memories we hold tight, we're living life like we need it
And we won't apologize for the fight
I'm feelin' alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman takin' over the land
We're gonna race some hell and have a real good time
Oh, I'm makin' some memories that'll last all life
That'll last all life
Oh, I'm feeling alive with a drink in my hand
And a wild woman taking over the land
We'll raise some hell and have a real good time
Gonna make some memories, oh, that's all right
