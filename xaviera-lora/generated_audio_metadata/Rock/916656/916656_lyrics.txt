She was a girl that you couldn't say, say no to
You'd sympathise'cause she had a way to get inside you
You'd leave your heart open just a bit, enough for her to get in
You'd arrive home and there she sits
Waiting for you
Butterflies in your stomach
Something somewhere that you cannot control
Tongue tied and twisted
It's nothing you know
She dressed the same way as you did
For some reason it was cool
She'd hide away every time you hid
Yeah that was most of the time
Your parents thought it was just a phase
To get some more attention
You had been acting pretty strange
So much more than normal
Butterflies in your stomach
Something somewhere that you cannot catch out
Torn, tied and twisted
It's nothing you know
They told you love wouldn't let you grow
They said it just wanted more
But you knew it wouldn't let you go
Something you couldn't ignore
You weren't unlucky but there it was
Staring you right in the face
The sweetest thing that you'd ever crossed
After a time and place, oh
She was a girl that you couldn't say, say no to
You'd sympathise'cause she had a way to get inside you
You'd leave your door open just a bit, enough for her to get in
You'd arrive home bound as she sits
She's waiting for you
Butterflies in your stomach
Something somewhere that you cannot control
Tongue-tied and twisted
It's nothing you know
They told you love wouldn't let you grow
They said it just wanted more
But you knew it wouldn't let you go
Something you couldn't ignore
You weren't looking but that she was
Staring you right in the face
The sweetest thing that you'd ever crossed
At the right time and place
It told you love wouldn't let you grow
They said it just wanted more
But you knew it wouldn't let you go
Something you couldn't ignore
You weren't looking but there she was
Staring you right in the face
The sweetest thing that you'd ever crossed
At the right time and place
