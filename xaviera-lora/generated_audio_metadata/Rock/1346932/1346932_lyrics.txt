And I went nowhere today
And I saw no one today
You don't wanna be me, I can see it
You don't wanna know yourself
But that's everything but bad
I'm having a good time with me
All I need is two chords
That are ringing one two
All I really need is me
And all you really need is yourself
And I went nowhere today
And I saw no one today
You don't wanna be me
You, you don't wanna be me
And I went nowhere today
And I saw no one today
You don't wanna be me
You, you don't wanna be me, yeah
