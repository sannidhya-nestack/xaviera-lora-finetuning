Vivid visions in the twilight, colours so sublime
Painting thoughts in the night, a silent pantomime
Through the fog a melody arises, in the shadows we align
A secret tune we're chasing, on a thread so fine
Chasing shadows in the silence where the stars confide
Harmonies of untold stories hidden deep inside
In this canvas of an era let our spirits glide
Lost within the midnight serenade where dreams reside
Whisper through the curtains, secrets left to find
Stories in the silence, histories in wine
In this moment we are drifting, thoughts so unconfined
Embrace the velvet misting
World behind
Tracing shadows in the silence
Where the stars confide
Harmonies of untold stories
Hidden deep inside
In this canvas of an enigma
Let our spirits glide
Lost within the midnight serenade
Where dreams reside
Fragments of our voices shimmer like the gleam
Crafting tales of wonder like a painter's theme
In the silence there's a promise
More than it may seem
Let's weave a tapestry of light
An everlasting beam
Chasing shadows in the silence
Where the stars confide
Harmonies of untold stories
Hidden deep inside
In this canvas of enigma
Let our spirits glide
Lost within the midnight serenade where dreams resign
Through the veil of whispers, find a place to start
Crafting endless verses
In the silent art
Let this melody be timeless
Deep within our heart
In this digital symphony
We'll never part
