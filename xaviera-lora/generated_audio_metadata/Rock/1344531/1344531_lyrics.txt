They're closing the woods to all traffic after dark
All them little cars got to find a place to park
As far as I'm concerned I know I'll do alright
Like an African queen in the Parisian night
Can you dig it?
I can rig it
You wanna get right
Can't go home tonight
You might as well admit it'cause it's plain as can be
No one gives a damn about the periphery
As long as you're producing you'll be out of sight
Like the African queen of the Parisian night
Can you rig it
I could dig it
You wanna get tight, can't go home tonight
You better watch your step, don't just spit in the street
Or the man come and take you away
And the night is young, still got nowhere to stay
You better watch your step
Don't you spit in the street
Or the man come and take you away
The night is young
And still got nowhere to stay
I don't know if you know it but it's plain as can be
No one gives a damn about you or me
Everybody knows your bark is worse than your bite
Like the African queen of the Parisian night
Can you dig it?
Goes like a rigging
You wanna get right
Can't go home tonight
You wanna get right, can't go home tonight
