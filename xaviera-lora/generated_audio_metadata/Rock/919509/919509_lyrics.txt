Baby, let's take a little ride on the curves and lines of our bodies
Oh, let us secretly
Between our sheets where no one else could ever get to hear us scream
So sweetly
You know, girl
That I live off, off
Making love, yeah
I live off of making sweet love
To you, yeah to you
Oh to you, yeah to you
In this moment
Nothing in the world could shake
The way I feel
And your skin on my skin baby is all I know to be real
Oh real yeah
You know, girl
That I live off, off, off
Making love, yeah
I live off of making sweet love
To you, yeah to you
Oh, to you
Yeah, to you
Yeah, you know I'm down
And I live off of making love, yeah
I live off of making sweet love to you
Yeah, I need you
All of you
Yeah, I need you
