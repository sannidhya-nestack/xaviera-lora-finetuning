Well he's the all night lover in your fantasy
And in your dreams he can do no wrong
Dance all night never miss a step no no
If you want tougher than leather or soft as a feather
He knows what makes a woman feel good
Loving you every which way but inside out
'Cause he's a hard-driving man
Rock you all the way until morning
He can take you without warning
Ooh, he's a hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
He's looking for somebody to love now, baby
How'bout you?
you've been hoping and wishing for a man on a mission, it's true
He's got long, wavy hair, perfect teeth
He can't wait to get underneath your cover
To see what you're so proud of
He's a hard-driving man
Feel the heat rise up from your skin
Let the thunder and lightning begin
Ooh, he's a hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
Hard-driving man
'Cause he's a hard-drivin' man
Give you everything he's got now, babe
Work it over and over and over again
Ooh, he's a, ooh, he's a hard-drivin' man
Hard-drivin' man
Hard-drivin' man
I'm driving man
