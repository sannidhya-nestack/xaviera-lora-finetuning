La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Say what you want to
I don't have to understand
Stare if you have to
Scratch my back until I bleed
I know you're leaving somehow
You're always leaving
And though I'm sleeping out somehow
Still here breathing my love
Stay if you have to
Just close your eyes
And I awake
Cold sneaks up on you
Hold my hand I'll understand
I know you're lonely somehow
You're always lonely
And I wake up only to find
Still hear you breathing my love
I know you're leaving but somehow
I still believe in our love
The way I'm feeling I'm so cold
I stay here dreaming
Ah, ah, ah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Way, ah, way, way, oh
Someday you'll be free
(Amen)
