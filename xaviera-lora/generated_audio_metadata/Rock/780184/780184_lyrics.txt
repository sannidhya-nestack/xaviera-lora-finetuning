Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure break
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
I feel the pressure breaking down on me I feel the pressure break down
Can you see?
And take me apart at the seams
I don't know if I ever can be put back together now
I've been blamed, abused, otten and used
Played the part in your game'til there's nothing inside of me
Building and breathing and burning and seizing and turning me inside out
And I think
This is changing me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure break down
Can you see?
Take me apart at the seams'Cause I don't know if I ever can be put back together now
Can you see? Oh, can you see?
And take me apart at the seams,'cause I don't know if I ever can be, ever can be
And take me apart at the seams
Cause I don't know if I ever can be put back together now
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
Feel the pressure breaking down on me
