He's the devil's man
Well don't ever plan
Bring him to your knees
When the river's so down deep
He's casting a spell
And taking you straight to hell
See the devil man
He'll grab you by the hair
There will be no defense
A fever so intense
It's all that's denied
The devil's in disguise
Girl, real attitude, breaking all the rules
You don't care about anything
Committing mortal sins
Look into those eyes
The devil will hit your chest
He's the devil man with an evil plan
Bring it to your knees
Just like a bad disease
Fall under his spell
And follow him straight to hell
Now he's casting a spell and taking you straight to hell
You're going to hell with the devil man
