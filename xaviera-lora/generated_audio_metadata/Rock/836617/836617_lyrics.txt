Why not stand out what you want to say?
Instead you hide behind your Facebook page
I know it different and I feel your hate
One being victim I'll be part of rage
You find it easy to assign the blame
You spread your lies and disrespect my name
I got something you could never gain
Your backward mind will never understand
Tell me please who you think that you are
Do you feel that it's alright
To look at me with those knives? Remember
I can, I can be broken
I can, I can be broken
you knock me down, I'll get up again
I'm scarred but undefeated
I'm kind but that's not weakness
If you bring me down I'll be back again
When you were lost I helped you find your way
But soon my tortures have become my reigns
Your ego dragged you down another road
I took you places I would never go
Tell me please who you think that you are
Do you feel good, it's alright
To connect me with those times, remember
I can, I can be broken
I can, I can be broken
you knock me down, I'll get up again
I'm scarred but undefeated
I'm kind but that's not weakness
If you bring me down, I'll be fat again
Tell me please, who do you think that you are?
Do you feel that it's alright
To look at me with those eyes, remember?
I can, I can be broken
I can, I can be broken
If you knock me down, I'll get up again
I'm scarred but undefeated
I'm kind but that's not weak, girls
If you bring me down, I'll be back again
