Everybody likes a London girl
A skirt that's short and a saucy curl
Eyes like a tan roof, shining bright
She got the stick in her pocket all night
Everybody likes everybody's dance
They expect to make up beyond compare
Everybody wants everybody needs
A taste of the feel, a sweetest beat
I see the skin
Everybody likes a rebel heart
Being fat with a fashionable start
She walks alone through Camden's night
Her style's on fire with a punk rock light
Everybody likes everybody's death
It's just that they can't be uncle there
Everybody wants everybody needs
A taste of the soul, the serious beat
Proceed as bees
In the city, this man was pleased
She's a shining star in the morning's gaze
With every step she's waves her crown
A true orator in his own town
(A true orator in his own town)
I don't stand as minister to let cops be on the net
Everybody wants, everybody needs
A twist of the privileged to do speech
Everybody likes a London girl
With a skirt that's short and sassy curl
Eyes like the Thames, shining bright
She's got the city in her pocket tonight
Everybody likes, everybody stares
Many skirts and makeup we all compare
Everybody wants, everybody needs
A taste of the real, the city's beast
Everybody likes her rebel heart
Beating fast with her fashionable start
She walks alone through Camden's night
Her style's on fire with her punk rock light
Everybody likes, everybody stares
Nanny skirts and make up, beyond compare
Everybody wants, everybody needs
A taste of the thrill the city speeds
In the city's endless haze
She's a shining star in a modest daze
With every step she claims her ground
A true original in this stubborn town
Everybody likes everybody stares
Many skirts and makeup beyond compare
Everybody wants everybody needs
A taste of the thrill the city speeds
