Don't stay close to me walk away let me be why won't you
Not for the life of me honestly you can't conceive why
You'd want to walk away take your time
Hurry up
Make up your mind
With every word you say to me
You're farther from reality now
You've gone too far
Too far
What's this supposed to be
Where's the life you promised me
Not one clue
Nothing here in life's for free
Misguided by complacency
Where will you run to
Walk away, take your time, hurry up, make up your mind
With every word you say to me, you're farther from reality now
You've gone too far, too far
Every time I look around, there you are, staring down at the world
So pick your feet up off the ground, show me now, tell me what you're worth
Yeah, I know, yeah
Every time I look around, there you are, staring down at the world
So pick your feet up off the ground, show me now, tell me what you're worth
Every time I look around, there you are, staring down at the world
So pick your feet up off the ground
Show me now, tell me what's your worth
Show me what's your worth
