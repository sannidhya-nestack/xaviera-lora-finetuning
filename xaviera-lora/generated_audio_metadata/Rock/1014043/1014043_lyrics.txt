If we walked along
Would you let me hold your hand?
And if I can't let go
Would you understand?
Well if it's only for a while
Would you let me be your man
I really love your style
And I'm gonna miss your smile
But the one thing that just ain't right is the word goodbye
A summer day can turn cold if I see you walk away
But my heart just unfolds when you say you'll stay
In the moment I feel fine
But no matter how I try
Just can't seem to find the word goodbye
The word goodbye
Yeah!
So will we make it to tomorrow
Well I just don't know
But I will be coming back
Somewhere down the road
In the moment that you're near
It's the moment that it all comes clear
And the one thing that you'll never hear
The word goodbye
No you'll never hear
The word goodbye
