Some might say the one day meets
The other half lies and a passerby says hello
It's never gonna last forever today
To be free to pacify
Ask me a question I'll tell you all I know
It's never gonna last forever today
And I know, it's gonna be a long time'til I walk down Sunday streets
And put a smile on my face
Yes I know, it's gonna be a long time till I walk down those streets
And put a smile on my face
It's okay when you ask me why
One man sleeps and another must try
I know it's never gonna last forever today
But I say to you that all things change
Some things might stay the same
Some might move but I know
That shit is never gonna last another rainy day
'Cause I know it's gonna be a long time to walk down some day streets
And put a smile on my face
Yes I know it's gonna be a long time to walk down those streets
And put a smile on my face for you
Yes I know, it's gonna be a long time'til I walk down some day streets
And put a smile on my face
I know, it's gonna be a long time till I walk down those streets
And put a smile on my face
