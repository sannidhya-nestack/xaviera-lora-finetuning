Looking back at me in the mirror today
I noticed a man with a touch of grey
A little color might help
But it ain't my style
But I've been well maintained as the years unfold
Most of my time's been spent on the road
I got some wear and tear
But they're all highway miles
Highway miles
Kick back and put your feet up and let's cruise a while
Highway miles
Or freedom miles
I got some wear and tear
But they're all highway miles
I try to get some sleep on this old treadmill
Coffee break to take away the morning chill
From being up all night on the FM dial
I put on my shades and I hit the streets
The tour bus is always waiting patiently
It's got some wear and tear
But they're all highway miles
Highway miles
Kick back and put your feet up and let's cruise a while
Highway miles
A freedom miles
I got somewhere in there
But they're all highway miles
Let it roll, let it roll
Banking out the music where the blacktop goes
I'm right where I belong
Rocking to the road with a Monday lawn
It's good to see old friends
We do our show
Oh and then we roll again
Highway miles
Now kick back and put your feet up and let's cruise a while
Highway miles
Of freedom miles I got some wear and tear
But they're all highway miles
Highway miles
Now kick back and put your feet up and let's cruise the wild
Highway miles
Or freedom miles
I got some wear and tear
But they're all highway miles
