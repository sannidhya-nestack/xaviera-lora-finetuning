Late day hush on the avenue
Windows crack, letting in the view
Ticket stubs in the glove box tin
Every laugh says start again
Street signs change like a flip book page
Miles unwind, easing off the rage
If the day felt heavy, let it pass
Lead my way, let the moment last
Count it in and take my hand
Slow it down, we'll make our stand
Every breath is proof enough
We got time to learn to run
Stay for the long run, don't fade away
Stay for the long run, we'll find our way
When the world moves fast and we come undone
Hold on tight, one by one
Stay for the long run
Say you're gonna stay, stay for the long run
Come what may
Hallway clock with a gentle tick
Mail piled up on the kitchen brick
Your sweater rests on the dining chair
All I need is already there
Let the small talk clear the room
Make some space where the heart can bloom
If the past keeps knocking like it owns the door
We'll answer once they're not anymore
Count it in, and take my hand
Slow it down, we'll make our stand
Every breath is proof enough
We've got time to learn the road
Stay for the long run, don't fade away
Stay for the long run, we'll find our way
When the world moves fast and we come undone
Hold on tight, one by one
Stay for the long run
Say you're gonna stay, stay for the long run
Come with me
No parade, no grand design
Just steady steps along the line
If the ground should shake, we won't let go
We've been the road before it falls
Oh (stay) count it, two, three, breathe (stay)
Right here next to me (stay) whisper then believe
We've got what we need, stay for the long run
Don't fade away
Stay for the long run
We'll find our way
When the world moves fast and we come undone
Hold on tight
One by one
Stay for the long run
Say you're gonna stay
Stay for the long run
Come what may
Leave the door on a gentle swing
I'm on the path to the simplest thing
If there's a line that leads to us as one
I'll walk it, stay for the long run
