So long, so long now
How long to go how
So long, so long now
You belong to the wind today
You belong to the wind today
How long, how far, how
How deep the pain can go
I write the wrongs you show
They belong to the wins today
They belong to the winds today
You blow in search of my heart
Drifting all the day
Sit still and enter rising
Black hole shows the way
You square enough, so my heart glides in me again
And again, you drift away today
How well, how true you know
My empty heart's gone cold
Secrets left untold
They belong (they belong) to the winds today
You brought such of my heart to drift another day
Set sail, event horizon, but cold shows the way
You swear an oath of my heart, lied to me again and again
You drift away today
You belong to the winds today
You belong to the winds today
You belong to the winds today
You belong to the winds today
