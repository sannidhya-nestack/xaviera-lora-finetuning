Sunset lines on the interstate
Paper cup and a mixed tape fade
Your laugh cuts through the traffic haze
Turns a long day into better days
Hands attending to hearts keeping time
Singing half the words still feels right
If the world runs hot and the news runs cold
Turn it down low let the love take hold
We don't need much, just a steady beat
A little mercy and an open seat
When the night gets loud, we take it slow
Find our lane and let it flow
Keep it easy on the radio
Make our love a ride in stereo
Through the midnight to the morning glow
If we get lost, we'll take it slow
Keep it easy on the radio
Hold me close and let it roll
Kitchen light on a weekday late
Candid boxes, pencil dates
Your note on the fridge says breathe be kind
All the rush fades from my mind
Take off your worries like an overcoat
Leave them hanging by the door you wrote
We'll count our blessings like a drum beat line
Step to the groove till the stars align
We don't need more than a whispered tune
Two soft voices and a silver moon
When the eight kicks in, we let it go
Find the chorus we both know
Keep it easy on the radio
Make our love ride in stereo
Through the midnight to the morning glow
If we get lost we'll take it slow
Keep it easy on the radio
Hold me close and let it roll
No fireworks, just a steady flame
No grand speech, just you sayin' my name
We'll take the long way, windows down
Let the breeze turn the page around
Every mile, every hay we'll find
Finds a home in the second light (oh-oh-oh)
Easy on the radio (oh-oh-oh)
Don't let the feeling go
Oh, oh, oh
Count it in
Two, three
Sing it back to me
Keep it easy on the radio
Make our love a ride in stereo
Through the midnight to the morning glow
If we get lost, we'll take it slow
Keep it easy on the radio
Hold me close and let it roll, let it roll
Fade the lights, let the soft waves play
I'll be yours at the end of the day
Turn it up low, let the good times flow
We'll keep it easy on the radio
