In the shadows where the wild flowers bloom
As we tread under the watchful moon
Mountains high and valleys low
Journeys shared where rivers flow
When the road ahead seems unclear
I find strength with you near
Though the storm may rage outside
With you I take it in stride
Crossroads of destiny we align
In the dance of fate so fine
Through the trials, through the strain
We find solace breaking chains
The look forest deep and green
Whisper tales sights unsung seen
Steps you take bold and true
Facing all just me and you
And when the mountain seems too steep
I find courage secrets to keep
Though the world may twist and turn
With you I always learn
Whose rules of destiny we align?
Through the dance of fate so fine
Through the trials, through the strain
We find solace in breaking chains
The forest deep and green
Whispered tales, sights unseen
Steps we take, bold and true
Facing all, just me and you
And when the mountain seems too steep
I find courage, secrets to keep
Though the world may twist and turn
With you, I always learn
Crossroads of destiny, we're alive in the dense fate so fine
Through the trials, through the strain, we find solace breaking chains
As the twilight fades you break, in your eyes I find my way
Echoes linger softly play, love eternal come what may
