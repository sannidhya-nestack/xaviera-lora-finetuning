Need a skip tracer
Need a skip tracer
To track down my heart
That's right
My heart's been M .I .A. so long
I had to clear out the cobwebs
Uh-huh, I don't know where it went wrong
I thought it might be dead
Out of commission since I don't know when
Gotta do something drastic to find it again
I need a skin tracer
To track down my heart
Private investigator to do his part
I feel like a caveman rubbing sticks just to make a spark
I need a skip tracer to track down my heart
I searched my heart on social media
I must confess
I went through Wikipedia
And its last address
I talked to everyone we knew
Friends and family
I even searched the dark web but I wound up empty
Not a zip seal
Hired a bounty hunter and a loan shark
Fortune teller left me in the dark
I need a skip tracer
To track down my heart
Private investigator
To do his part
I feel like a caveman rubbing sticks
Just to make a spark
I need a skip tracer
To track down my heart
Need a skip tracer
Need a skip tracer
To track down my heart
Skip town
No return address
