Never saw it coming, no he never thought in me
Left out like he is now
Walked three feet among the ground
He saw the world as if it was made for him
Oh oh
On the outside
Freezing looking in
Through the window
I defy all from the outside
He crashed back down to the ground like a meteorite
On his very last flight through the universe
And he wanted to turn back the clock
To the time that he was saving the youth around
Oh
He's on the outside freezing looking in
To the skies talking to the stars
Can I join you in the sky?
So I can float with you in the sky?
I wish that I could fly
Gravity keeps me down, down underground, down
He's on the outside, freestanding, looking in
We're low at a higher from the outside, outside, outside, outside, outside, outside
