Ain't got no time for bullshit talk or afterthoughts
With a curvy nose and sweet sundated gums
Gonna do what's wrong, gonna drink'til dumb
Gonna wish upon a twinkly little star
Just awake when the morning comes
Give me any reason to sin and I'll sin
Give me any reason to live awfully
Give me any reason to seek blessed feelings
Give me any reason to sin, just to sin
I'll spark a flame and let my bridges burn
It keeps me warm
Crank my amplifier drown out the world
With a little wipe with a little ride
And a clenched down smile
Think I'm living I'm splitting
At the seams
Give me any reason to sin and I'll sin
Give me any reason to live, awfully
Give me any reason to seek, blessed feelings
Give me any reason to stand, just to stand
Give me any reason to sin and I'll sin
Give me any reason to live awfully
Give me any reason to seek blessed feelings
Give me any reason to sin just to sin
Give me any reason to sin and I'll sin
Give me any reason to live awfully
Give me any reason to see
Illicit feelings give me any reason to sin
Just to sin
