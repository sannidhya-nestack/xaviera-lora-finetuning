I spent way too long
But with my head in the clouds
I go to sing her this song
And she's cutting me down while she's fucking you now
I guess it's all my fault
Why you even bother to call?
I go to lay it on the line and she's cutting me down while she's fucking you now
She keeps cutting me down
She keeps cutting me down
Yeah, I hope I've learned this time
Never to play with a fire
She's got a way with the words
And she's cutting me down just to get a little higher
I guess it's on my phone
Why even bother to call
I go to lay out on the line
And she's got a need down
And you know it's no surprise (Been so long)
In this hell (she keeps calling me)
So confused (she keeps calling me)
And I will (been so long)
In this hell, so confused and not well
All this time, you let me down
I watch you laugh and watch me drown
Been so long in this hell
So confused and not well
All this time
You let me down, I'll watch you laugh and watch me drown
