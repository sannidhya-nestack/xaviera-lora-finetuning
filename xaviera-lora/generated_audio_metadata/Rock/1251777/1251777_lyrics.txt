You can walk if it's what you want
Maybe a little space is a great place to start
But if you find a change in mind
Let me make it clear
I'll be right here, it's alright
We both know how many ways this can go
Take your time, let it fall in line
It's time to start the show
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around
When you think
That we've had enough
Losing what we had
Everything that was ours
Yeah your touch
Still lights me up
We still got a chance
To make it
We're still in love
We're just trying to live our story
We're getting by
We got hope, don't need glory
But I'll be by your side
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around, here we go again
Around and around
Round and around, here we go again
Round and around, here we go again
Round and around, here we go again
Round and around
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Here we go again
Around and around
Around and around
Around and around
Around and around
Around and around
