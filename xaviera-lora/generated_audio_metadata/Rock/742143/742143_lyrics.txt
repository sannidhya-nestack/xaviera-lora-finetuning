Who knows what tomorrow brings
But now I'm wrapped up tight with you
Hope and love go on for eternity
Cherish every moment that I have with you
Butterfly
Days and times like this there's bumps in road
Take it in as it comes along
Can you feel the light and laughter grow
Vanish on the wall then the love is won
Butterfly
You're free to fly
We are sitting on a gold mine
Soaking, soaking up the sunshine
We are sitting on a gold mine
Soaking, soaking
Now that we began to see
We wipe the sleep from our eyes
Time to stand and sing out strong
But spread the love and all across the lands
Christmas has come undone
The time for peace and war is won
Time to unite
Time to unite
White butterflies
We are sitting so close
We are sitting on a gold mine
Soaking, soaking out of the sunshine
Free to fly
Butterflies, free to fly, butterflies, free to fly, butterflies, free to fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
