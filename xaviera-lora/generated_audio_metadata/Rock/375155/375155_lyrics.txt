Heartless and a fool
Ignoring needy people who
Are lonely, sad, crying inside
Trying not to be left behind
Chasing wants and wasting days
Helping hands the only way
Empty hearts and hopeless stairs
When will there be one who cares?
Two hearts are better than one
Make a difference and be the one to reach out and give
Two hearts are better than one
When two hearts come alive it'll be a better day
Pour in your heart for riches lost
Inside yourself you pay the cost
A lonely one needs a companion
Be the one, one in a million
Help others realize
Live your best life, keep your dreams alive
Pay your dues'cause you have to
The happiness to ever find you
Two hearts are better than one
Make a difference and be the one
It shows the world you love
Two hearts are better than one
When two hearts intertwine, it'll be a better day
Two hearts are better than one
Make a difference and be the one to reach out and give
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts are better than one
Caring hearts sing our melodies
Our hearts as one can keep the beat
Two hearts are better than one
Make a difference, be the one to reach out and give
Two hearts are better than one
Make a difference
And be the one to show the world you love
Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts come alive, it'll be a better day
When two hearts come alive, it'll be a better day (be a better day)
It'll be a better day (be a better day)
It'll be a better day (be a better day)
It'll be a better day
