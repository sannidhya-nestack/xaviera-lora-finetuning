Girls in motion
Computer driven
They're all dancing
To different rhythms
(Receive, receive)
No reaction
(Different, different)
Without warning
It's time to quit it
Ooh, ooh
We're doing the best we can
Ironic
It's all in the master plan
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
A future unknown to man
Ironic
Man in motion
Computer driven
No emotion
No way of living
(Receive, receive)
No reaction
(Tiffin, tiffin)
Without warning
It's time to quit it
(Ooh, ooh)
We're doing the best we can, ironic
It's all in the master plan
A future unknown to me, ironic
Reason, reason
No reaction
Different, different
Reason, reason
Being so passionate
We're doing the best we can
Ironic, ooh, ooh
It's all in the master plan
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
A future unknown to man
Ironic, ooh, ooh
