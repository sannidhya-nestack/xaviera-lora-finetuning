The voice of the voiceless
Strangers with unfamiliar face
Time for an answer
One more excuse for this disgrace
Some answered anger
It's time to take what we deserve
We'll wait, wait past reason
Now the people will be heard
I don't care
What you say
It's the same old lies, just on a different way
We're on our own, no help at all
A generation otten
We're on our own, no help at all
A generation otten
Lesser of two evils
Probing master pulling on your strings
Same story told a thousand times
Which one should we really believe?
Greed and deception
Both traits the king's made to possess
We are not the fallen
So will it not be lost?
Just yet I don't care
What you say?
It's the same old lies
Just on a different way
We're on our own, no help at all
A generation otten
We're on our own, no help at all
A generation otten
We stand together
One voice with abstract open arms
Generation otten
Through no will fall our thought grown
We are the masters
Of our own destiny
No more excuses for us
It's really us that holds the key
We're on our own
No help at all, the generation otten
We're on our own, no help at all, generation otten
