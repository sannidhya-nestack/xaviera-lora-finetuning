Take a load off your mind, baby, you're one of a kind
Let your individuality be your guide
Yeah, yeah, you got it
You got a responsibility to yourself
Never be satisfied trying to be somebody else
If you're gonna fly then you can't let the world keep you down
You're running out of time, it's time to stop waiting around
Oh yeah yeah, we got it
Yeah, yeah
We got it
We got it
It doesn't matter what they say
We gotta play their games
There's nothing we can do to please them
They don't care anyway
Got a responsibility
To be ourselves
We'll pay a high cost if we try to be anyone else
Yeah yeah, we got it, yeah yeah, we got it, we got it, yeah yeah, we got it
Yeah, yeah, we got it, we got it
And you know you've reached your higher ground
When you own that confidence you found
Baby, let it shine out, sometimes we gotta go our own way
Shine it on, love
Just let it go, I know you got something to say
Make your mind or you'll lose your mind
Yeah yeah, we got it, yeah yeah, we got it, we got it, yeah yeah, we got it, yeah yeah, we got it, we got it
