Step back, the sky's the limit
So step back and look at the sky and
Just then your stomach drops
And just then you wonder what it's about
Right now we're calling out
Step back, you know that I could be anything
Tell me what you wanted
And tell me what you wanted
Do not stop when they're twisting your arm
Just let it break and your screams will shake the earth
Your friends and your cliche means
You're bulletproof in every way possible
Right now we spark the thought
Between the marketing and cost
I'll run the company
I'll tip toe, tip toe
To the top of it
Welcome back
Routine, you're right, you're right
On time, I'll fall, fall right back down
Tell me, tell me what you want me
Tell me what you want me
Do not stop when they're twisting your arm
Just let it break and your screams will shake the earth
Your friends and your cliched memes
You're bulletproof in every way possible
We're almost done, almost done with this killing time
Wait it out, bide your time'cause the odds will turn
Sooner or later the odds will be bribery
