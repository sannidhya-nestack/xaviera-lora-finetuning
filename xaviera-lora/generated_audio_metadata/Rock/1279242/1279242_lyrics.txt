He liked a pinstripe shirt and a bass guitar
He'd look over his shoulder, he didn't look far
Catfish, catfish, where you swim?
Catfish, catfish, come on in
Mississippi River barge, ten long, two wide
Eighteen thousand horsepower, that will drive
Catfish, catfish, where you swim
Catfish, catfish, come on in
There's a three sink alley
Crawfish on the floor
Beer in the cooler
A reefer and more
Catfish, catfish, where you swim
Catfish, catfish, come on in
Catfish don't like alligator or cottonmouth too
Prefer an old Ford car
To swim on through
Catfish, catfish, where you swim
Catfish, catfish, come on in
Catfish, catfish, come on in
Catfish, catfish, come on in
