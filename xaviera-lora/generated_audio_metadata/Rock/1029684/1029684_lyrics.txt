I try to be a decent man
Living clean and living right
But I keep feeling the devil's hand
And I'm running low, low on fight
He beats me down, I get back up
But that snake won't let me be
I guess one round ain't hell enough
Why's the devil keep picking on me?
Why's the devil keep picking on me?
Am I on his list of who needs misery
Don't he know I'm not his kind
And he'll never change my mind
Why's the devil keep picking on me?
In my younger years I was pretty wild
Did a few things I regret
And through sinners tears I wonder now
Is he collecting on some old debt?
Why does the devil keep picking on me?
Am I on his list of who needs misery
Don't he know I'm not his kind
And he'll never change my mind
Why's the devil keep picking on me
My resolve might be growing thin
But I refuse to let that sumbitch win
Why does the devil keep picking on me
Am I on his list of who needs misery
Don't he know I'm not his kind
And he'll never change my mind
Why does the devil keep picking on me
Why does the devil
Keep picking on me
