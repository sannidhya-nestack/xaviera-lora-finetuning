At the end of my rope
Out of faith cannot cope
Feeling so far from heaven
Am I out of my mind
Looking for a lifeline
Cause it's got to get better
I will rise again
I will rise again
With an open heart the healing begins
To rise again, rise again
When all hope can seem lost
At what price or what cost
Do you ask the tough questions?
How can I overcome
Will I see my loved ones again when all's a disaster
I will rise again
I will rise again
With an open heart the healing begins
To rise again
Tear it at the seams in my mind
Ah, but I'll never surrender this time
I will rise again, rise again
When it opened up the healing begins
To rise again
I will rise, rise again
With an open heart the healing begins
To rise again
