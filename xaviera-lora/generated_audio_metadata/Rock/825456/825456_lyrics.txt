We live, we dream
To speak the truth and never hide
We live from the heart
To free the galaxy inside
We laugh, we bleed
To ourselves it will be true
Through dust and ash
You know there's nothing we can't do
Before too late
The world will be ours
Before too late
We'll fly among the stars and live our way
We'll live our way
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We dance, we sing
And let tomorrow light our way
We don't give up
Stolen moments, fearless days
Before too late
The world will be ours
Before too long
We'll fly among the stars and live our way
We'll live our way
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The world will be ours
We'll die under the stars to live our way
We'll live our way
It'll be our day
We'll live our way
