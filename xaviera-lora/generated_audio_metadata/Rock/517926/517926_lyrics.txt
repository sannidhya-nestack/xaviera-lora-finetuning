We're not getting any younger
Standing here
And now would be a good time
To look in the mirror
You could see we're growing older
Year by year
Singing over and over
Soon disappears
I wanna grab something
That seems so cold
It can't even mean nothing
But no one knows
Until we go out there
With open arms
We may never know cold hands
Is a warm heart
Give me something to hope for
Something to believe
Or can you tell me you want more
For you and me
Give me something to hope for
Something to believe
Or can you tell me you want more
For you and me
We're not making any progress, so stop right here
And now would be a good time, a good time to face your fears
You can see we're resting still, and it's so clear
We're close enough to fall through, you were far too near
Give me something to hope for, something to believe
Can you tell me you want more, for you and me?
Give me something to hope for, something to believe
Can you tell me you want more, for you and me?
We need to stick together through thick and thin
Through the stormy weather and the wars we swear we'll win
Before the wet green skies and they were covering
But through the beautiful blue eyes and now they see
And we see
Give me something to hope for, something to believe
Can't you tell me you want more, for you and me
Give me something to hope for, something to believe
Can't you tell me you want more, for you and me
Yeah, you and me
You know you and me (make me something to believe)
Yeah you and me (make me something to believe)
I came to something to hope for, something to believe
I came to tell you I'm more for you and me (make me something to believe)
Came to something to hope for, something to believe (make me something to believe)
I came to tell you I'm more for you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me, you and me
