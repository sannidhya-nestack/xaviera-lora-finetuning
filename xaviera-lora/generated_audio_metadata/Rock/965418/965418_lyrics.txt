He's gone, he tumbled down and faced his fate
He had too much on his plate
And the walls came down they did and the walls came down
He climbed and slipped and slipped again
And then he fell
He tried so hard
Shaken by the wind is all
Shaken by the wind
Don't give up now, make it somehow
Keep on trying, you'll make it somehow
Don't give up now, make it somehow
Keep on trying, you'll make it somehow
Don't overdo it, make it somehow
Keep on trying, you'll make it somehow
He's dead, he found no way out and now
I'm left in doubt
And everything turned to black
And everything was black
And everything turned to black
And everything was black
