Welcome home
Well, come on, make me happy
Well, come on and tell me why
You're acting like I never tried
So go ahead and tell your lies
we both know it ain't no big surprise
It ain't no big surprise
Well I see, yeah
Well I see how you are
Well I've seen a lot these days
You're looking like you're gonna cry
So go ahead and drain those eyes
We both know it ain't no big surprise
Ain't no big surprise, ain't no big surprise, ain't no big surprise
Well, I guess goodbye
Well, I guess it just didn't work out
Well, I guess we're parting ways
You're acting like I never tried
So go ahead and tell your lies
Cause we both know it ain't no big surprise
It ain't no big surprise
It ain't no big surprise
It ain't no big surprise
Yeah
