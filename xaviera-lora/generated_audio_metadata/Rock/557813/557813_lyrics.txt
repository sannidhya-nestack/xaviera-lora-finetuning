I take a look around and everything's the same
Dissipating like a capia machine
At hottie shirts, converse without the laces
The spray on tans, hey, generation tasteless (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
It's not real fame on a reality show (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
It's time to face it,'cause you oughta know
Round and round, we're stuck in the middle
And I don't care, not even a little
It's the same old scene, painted with different faces
Much love from Generation Tasteless
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
G-g-g-generation tasteless
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
G-G-G-Generation Tasteless
The stupid actor mom and John are K +8
Give it up Spencer, Heidi's body's not that great
Come to think about it, who are you anyway?
Just another douchey guy, welcome to reality
You think you made it cause Perez knows your name
Got your fifteen minutes, now get out of my face
Round and round, we're stuck in the middle, and I don't care
Not even a little, it's the same old scene, painted with different faces
Much love from Generation Tasteless, I don't care
I don't care, Generation Tasteless, I don't care
I don't care, generation's tasteless
You're not a real star
But they follow you'cause they think you are
Do anything for attention
it gets you off when your name is mentioned
Round and round, we're stuck in the middle and I don't care
Not even a little, it's the same old scene
Painted with different faces, much love from Generation Tasteless
Round and round, we're stuck in the middle and I don't care
Not even a little, it's the same old scene
Painted with different faces, much love from Generation Tasteless
I don't care
I don't care, generation tasteless
I don't care, I don't care, generation tasteless
Generation tasteless
Generation tasteless
