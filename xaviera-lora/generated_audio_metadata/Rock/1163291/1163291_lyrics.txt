You want a lot, you want a bit, there is no middle
What are you waiting for? I haven't been silenced
Woah, woah
Cancel yesterday
Not a thing you can dispute
Start making your way, yeah
Act now, lift the crown, make it count
This is it, take a dive
We'll live each day like a ghost in my room
Time for the switch, back out from down
The stars align, which side are you on?
(Blue moon) (Sun) (Blue moon) (Sun) (Blue moon, blue moon)
Got what you want, don't let it slip even a little
We'll guard it even more
I was the finest, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the price to pay
Always something more to lose
Much left to restore
Backs in now, lift the crown, make it count
This is it, take a dive
Won't live each day like a ghost in my room
Time for the switch, back out from down
The stars align, which side are you on?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This is it (this is it)
Take your time (take your time)
Won't let me stay like a ghost in my room
Time for the switch (time for the switch)
Back out from down
The stars aligned
Which side are you on? (which side?)
It's not over, it's not over yet
