Every, every, every day
Oh yeah yeah
It's all so irritating
I'm getting tired of waiting
Why are we hesitating?
Now we can see the end of the road
We make it complicated
When all we have is fading
This love is overrated
Easy to stay but hard to let go
When I'm in your arms I need to try
But when I'm far away I want to say goodbye
Every day we keep falling apart
Every time I just break your heart
Every day
Every day
Everyone says I've got to move on
Every which way the feelings come
Every (every)
Every day
Every (every)
Every day, it's just the spell I'm under
That makes me start to wonder
Don't wanna be your lover
Every touch sends us further away
Things aren't the way they should be
Unlike these chains around me
You're better off without me
There is no reason for you to stay
When I'm in your arms I need to try
But when I'm far away I want to say goodbye
Every day we keep falling apart
Every time I just break your heart
Every (every)
Every day everyone says I've got to move on
Every which way the feeling's gone
Every (every)
Every day
Every day
When I'm in your arms I need to try (to try)
But when I'm far away I want to say goodbye
Every day we keep falling apart
Every time I just break your heart
Every day everyone says I've got to move on
Every which way the feeling's gone
Every day every day we keep falling apart
Every time I just break your heart
Every day, everyone says I've got to move on
Every which way the feeling's gone
Every, every, every day
Every, every, every day
Every, every, every day
