You can beg me but that ain't gonna get you anywhere
I can see right through you, I don't even care
You think I owe you but I was never really there
You can make threats, I'm not the kind of person you can scare
For the first time, I am truly inspired now, baby
By the body electrified and wild, yeah
And yeah, you're something beautiful in the air now, baby
But still you gotta hear it from the other side
Now go on roll over now
Yes I hear you that same old story hasn't really worked out yet
Take my hand promise there won't be a thing you will regret
For the first time I am truly inspired now baby
By the body electrified and wild yeah
And you'll hear something beautiful in the end now baby
But still you gotta hear it from the other side
Now go on roll over now
For the first time I am truly inspired now baby
By the body electrified and wild yeah
And there's something beautiful in me and now baby
But still you're gonna hear it from the other side
Nekowar rolls over now
