Midnight, come down to the Y
Been a long road I know
From Memphis to Yorkshire
Midnight with no place to hide
Last roll of the dice
I'm drowning deep water
Oh, it's time to see it through
Oh, got nothing left to lose
And the last chance to lose
Midnight, the clock's counting down
The years have run out
I'm old but no wiser
Midnight, gotta find the strength to win
No point giving in
Are the words of a fighter
Oh, it's time to see it through
Oh, got nothing left to lose
A portrait cut through
In the last chance saloon
Yeah, yeah, alright
Oh, the moment has arrived
Oh, will I reach the other side
Oh, it's time to see it through
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Got nothing left to lose
A poor drink or two
And the last chance I'll lose
Got a poor drink or two
