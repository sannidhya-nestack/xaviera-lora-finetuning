Calling the mind of Oswald
Calling the mind of Oswald
Take a deep breath and close your eyes
Close your eyes to it all
Calling the mind of Oswald
In and out, in and out
Repeat until all the walls are cleared and fall
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Recalling the mind of Oswald, now you're complete
You've really come to shine, populations notice on the street
There he is, resting on the water, drifting gently with the waters
And this transeason is real, as he's turning on the wheel
The mind of Oswald's reaching out
Connecting with the colonies
With words that have a great effect
On the nebula consciously
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Deeper and deeper still
Twenty aeons and a hundred parsecs
Is not as far as you can get
We're always scanning and devoted to your expansion
And your instinct knows its way around
Calling the mind of Oswald (the matter is suspended)
Are you still there in the mind of Oswald?
Calling the mind of Oswald (all matter is suspended)
Are you still there in the mind of Oswald
Twenty aeons and a hundred parsecs
Is not as far as you can get
We're always scanning and devoted to your expansion
And your instinct knows its way around
Calling the mind
A vase wall
All matter is suspended
