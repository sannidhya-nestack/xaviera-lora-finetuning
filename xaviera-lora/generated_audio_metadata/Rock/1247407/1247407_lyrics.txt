Cold hands warm nights entwined in our song
Now the silence screams where did we go wrong
In dreams we weave what reality unwinds
The echoes of days gently confined
You left a mark though your presence is gone
In this tapestry of memories
Painfully drawn
Still feel your touch
Your cold embrace
Ghost in my mind
Can't erase your face
These memories
Cloud my eyes
Whispers in the dark, echo through the halls
Can't escape the shadow of your calls
Woven into time, our story unfolds
But the pain remains, my heart recalls
We were flesh and bones
Now just a memory
Visions of us, they're frozen time
In this maze, I wander blind
Your voice, a phantom haunting my mind
Fragments of you, they bind
Beneath the stars where we used to lie
Now those same stars just make me cry
Waking up
Still feel the weight you left
Empty sheets, echoes of your breath
The silent screams, in this empty bed
Tracing the lines, where your form once bled
Your ghost it lingers, in every shadow
Pulling me back, where I can't follow
Your laughter echoes through the silence, hear a phantom whispering slowly
Fading pictures framed with hope and fear
Our world has changed but love's still sincere
In the dark I seek your light
In my dreams we reunite, can I?
We were flesh and bone
Now just a memory
Visions of us, they're frozen in time
In this maze, I wander blind
We are flesh and bone
Now just a memory
Visions of us, they're frozen in time
