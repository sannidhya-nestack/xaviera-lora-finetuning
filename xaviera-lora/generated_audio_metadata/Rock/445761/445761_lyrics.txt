Oh my God, what did you mean for me
Oh my Lord, what was my destiny
I chose a path that I could justify
Now all is lost and now the dream will die
I waste my effort and I waste my years
See my reflection in these broken mirrors
I took the pleasure, yes I took the pain
In the end I think they're both the same
But I'm magic
I'm magic
When did it change, when did I lose my way
A lack of action, lack of things to say
Where did I fail? Where did I go wrong?
What did I miss? Or did I take too long?
What was the lesson? What did my life teach?
Is success just ever out of reach?
It's hard for me to tell just what it means
I'll help a lot'cause I can feel like this, yeah
I'm magic
I'm magic
Oh my God, where has the reason gone?
Oh my Lord, when will I sing my song?
I've played along with this cruel tragedy
The sweet hereafter now it calls to me
But I'm magic, I'm magic
Oh my god, I'm magic
I'm magic, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a god
