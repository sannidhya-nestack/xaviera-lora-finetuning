I'm a prisoner of my own making
I built the walls now the walls are shaking
Let down my guard
And I let you in
A moment of weakness
And I was on my knees
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
I'm wasting my days in my cell
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
In your arms I'm a prisoner
I've been saving
All my good deeds
Chalk on my fingers
The good Lord will save
Don't seek redemption
Nor a bum a penny
May you remember
The man before me
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
I can hear the tolling of the funeral bell
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
In your arms I'm a prisoner
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
You're gonna let me right here in this cell
Don't you know there's nothing more to tell
In your arms I'm a prisoner
In your arms I'm a prisoner
