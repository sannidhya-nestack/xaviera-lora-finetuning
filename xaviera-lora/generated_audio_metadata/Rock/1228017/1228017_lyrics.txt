There's a soft breeze blowing on the shore tonight
And the sands are white as snow
Got the moon on a string like a silver kite
And the stars are all aglow, come along for the ride
Don't be late, don't hesitate
There's no reason left for us to wait for time's now
Please delay, come along, I know we'll regret all someday
I know a little place tucked along the bay
Where they play guitar'til dawn
Throw a sleeping bag in your old stingray
And we'll crash out on the lawn
Come along for the ride
Don't be late, don't hear us change
There's no reason left for us to wait
The bite of your life
Tonight is now, it feeds an ape
Come along, we'll regret all someday
Honey, this ain't just another dead end
There's a new life waiting for us just around the bend
Come on
The ride of your life
Come along for the ride (Don't delay, don't hesitate)
There's no reason left for us to wait (The ride of your life)
Time is now, we delay (Come along)
You know we'll regret all someday
Ride this feeling like a comet
There's a dream with our names on it
And there's something in my soul that says it's true
I'm not trying to run from nothing
I'm just trying to find something
And I thought I caught a glimpse of it in you
Yeah, I know I saw a glimpse of it in you
The ride of your life
Come along
Ooh, come along
Ooh, won't you come
Oh, come along
Hey, oh, the ride of your life
Come along, night of your life
