If the world's had its way with you for too long
If your story's endless, give and don't take
Every chance you take, all your choice is wrong
I'd say you're due to finally catch a break
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
'Cause rivers rise but then recede
Cuts heal after they bleed
Storms roll in they come and go
Believe in tomorrow and when you come out the other side
You'll believe in the ride
You'll believe in the right
Well if you think your best days are way back when
I'd say good time Charlie hasn't seen his last
They say you can't get it back again
I say get in line for another blast
To hell with the past
To hell with the past
'Cause rivers rise but then recede
healed after they bleed
Storms roll in they come and go
Believe in tomorrow and when you come out the other side
You'll believe in the rise
You believe in the ride
'Cause rivers rise but then recede
here after they bleed
Storms roll in they come and go
Believe in tomorrow and when you come out the other side
You'll believe in the ride
You believe in the ride
You believe in the ride
You believe in the ride
