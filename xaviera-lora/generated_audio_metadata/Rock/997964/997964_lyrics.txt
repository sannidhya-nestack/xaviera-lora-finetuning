Look in the woods and silver pools
The sounds are limit to fly me
What I play is what I know
But I'm so wild without you
Lying there so another crowd
Time goes slowly by
Speak my name again out loud
I'm so wild about you
Evenings have no fear for me
I can settle easily
There's a tear in both my eyes
I'm trying to cut those ties
Heaven awaits
Nor hesitates
But I'm so wild about it
Still wild about you
Did you ever see a river play?
Lips begin their music
For all the world's masquerade
I'm so wild about you
I just recently found the will to live
And I can hear the angels tread
The silence of a shooting star
I've so wild about you
Evenings have no fear for me
I can settle easily
There's a tear in both my eyes
I'm trying to cut those ties
Heaven awaits, no hesitates
But I'm so wild about it, still wild about you
Come a little bit closer
I want to feel your breath on me
Take my body as you find it
I'm so wild (I'm so wild)
Still so wild (so wild)
Oh, I'm wild, mighty wild about you
