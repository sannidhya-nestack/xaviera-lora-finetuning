Got my feet in the water
Got time in the middle
Of a good old summer
Hot and wet
And I dream of my soul at the door
Waiting there
Heaven or hell
When I ring the bell
I go out for a dinner
In the streets of illusions
With the shoes of a seaman
And the hat of a saint
I'm bound where the river boots is
From bank to bank
Water or sand
When I turn the bend
Sun on my skin
I'm feeling fine
I can only move in time
And you won't catch me
Till the day I die
I stand on a corner
Got a strange kind of fear
In the next fifty seconds
I could disappear
Nobody can show me the end
No one can tell
If it's heaven or hell
When I ring the bell
Sun on my skin
I'm feeling fine
I can only move in time
But you won't catch me
Till the day I die
I got my feet in the water
Got time in the middle
Of a good old summer
Hot and wet
And I dream of my soul at the door
Waiting there
Heaven or hell
When I ring the bell
Heaven or hell
