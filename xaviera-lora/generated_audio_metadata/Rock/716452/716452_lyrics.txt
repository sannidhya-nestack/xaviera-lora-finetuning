And I promise your pain will go away
But not tomorrow, not today
The chase of hardships, fears and time
Can make whoever groan and cry
I'm gonna spend this night in your car
So that again you didn't leave
Now kiss
Rise, the lullaby will put you in a quiet dream
Your sorrows thick as it can be
For joy you gotta pay the fee
Just pack your griefs then lock them up
Unlock when you need memories
Your sorrow's thick as it can be
For joy you gotta pay the fee
Just pack your griefs then lock them up
Unlock when you need memories
