Hide it away, so no one will notice
Cover my face, so they don't get nervous
You think I'm okay, I'm good on the surface
You think I can make a change, is it worth it?
I'll live half as long
To smile twice as much
If it means getting rid of this misery
God pick up the phone
I can't fight alone
I need someone to tell me that
Sister you are so beautiful
I don't care what you tell yourself
Sister you are so beautiful
I don't care if the others will hate
How you laugh or make fun of the clothes that you wear
Girl you're perfect don't change a thing darling I swear
Sister you are so beautiful
I don't care what you tell yourself
Time to be strong, time to be happy
I'm done with the tears, I'm done with the worry
It's time I could dance
It's time I could start living life
It's time to hold hands with those who are by my side
I'll live half as long
To smile twice as much
If it means getting rid of this misery
God pick up the phone
I can't fight alone
I need someone to tell me that
Sister, you are so beautiful
I don't care what you tell yourself
Sister, you are so beautiful
I don't care if the others will hate
How you laugh or make fun of the clothes that you wear
Girl, you're perfect, don't change a thing, darling, I swear
I don't care, I don't care what you tell yourself
I don't care, I don't care what you tell yourself
I don't care, I don't care what you tell yourself
I don't care, I don't care what your tell yourself
I don't care, I don't care what your tell yourself
Sister you
So beautiful
Sister, you are so beautiful
I don't care if the others will hate how you laugh or make fun of the clothes that you wear
You're perfect, don't change a thing, darling, I swear
Sister, you are so beautiful
You are beautiful
