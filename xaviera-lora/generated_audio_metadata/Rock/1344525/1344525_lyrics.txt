There's a circuit that you oughta know
Put the power on and watch it go
Push pull, push pull, push pull, push pull, push pull
Voltage rising baby that's the scene
Keep it up and you will see what I mean
Push pull, push pull, push pull, push pull, push pull
Push pull, push pull, push pull
Juice is flowing that's what's going down
Feeling good, feeling good
I've been halfway around the world rectifying
All you need is a little girl
You can't hide it
Aren't you tired of technology?
I don't buy it
You better get a handle on biology
Push pull, push pull, push pull, push pull, push
Girl stronger, you're no longer a child, not a kid, not a kid
I've been halfway'round the world (victifying)
And all you need is a little girl (you can have it)
Now aren't you tired of technology? (I don't buy it)
I ought to get a handle on biology
Push, pull (push, pull)
Push, pull (push, pull)
Push, pull (push, pull)
Push, pull (push, pull)
