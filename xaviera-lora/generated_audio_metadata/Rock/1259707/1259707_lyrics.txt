Let me sketch for you, my sweet delight
A tale of love profound, star kissed in the night
Tell me my darling, I humbly seek
How can I love you?
Better this week
In words soft and gentle
We exchange our bliss
Touched by the whisper
Of a six second kiss
Love dream
You're my love dream
I'm your summer love dream
You're my love dream
Of how I first met you
Of heartbeats I sleep
Never seen a stranger
See a store-owned red sheet
Your eyes were magical
Your smile like the sun
Surprised you existed
You're unlike anyone
I dream of the ways that we savour each kiss
And our language of love's much, much more than this
And while we're not yet versed in each other's dark parts
The music we make will rewrite the star chart's love dream
You're my love dream
I'm this summer love tree
You're my love tree
A vow not to assume
Lord cast the wrong notion
How long is it titled
But deep down the soul's true
iveness my darling
Comes not as a demand
But as a gentle hope
Of an understanding head
How dance I let you lead
With your cadence divine
Your alone time I respect
Love doesn't confide
Seek you to understand
Not merely agree
My love is no cage
But a life that is free
Love tree
Right by a love tree
Up in summer love tree
Lift your burdens, promise sincere
Joy and then sorrow, I'll always be near
Working my issues like a silent prayer
A better version of myself every day that we share
My sensual lover, my heart's chosen soul
In a magical love dream where we both belong
Love dream
You're my love dream
A midsummer love dream
You're my love dream
