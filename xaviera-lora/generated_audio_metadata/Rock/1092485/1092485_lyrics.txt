I was driving to the panhandle on three thirty one
Saw an old black man hiding from the sun
Selling wooden crosses with Jesus on the front
Said he was mighty proud of all the work he'd done
I said, how do you build such a work of art?
These old hands, a hammer and a heart
He says son come sit beside me if you've got a little time
Tell you a story straight from mine
Started building crosses many years ago
You know folks would stop and buy them
As they come and go
I said, how do you build such a work of art?
These old hands are hammering hard
People always ask me
Why build a cross?
Son, I like to tell them
Once outlawed
Said, how do you build such a work of art?
These old hands are hammering hard
As I was leaving, he walked me to the road
He said, "Son, come back and see me"
As you come and go
I could see him in the mirror
Waving me goodbye
All his wooden crosses
Jesus by his side
I said how do you build such a work of art?
These old hands, a hammer and a heart
These old hands, a hammer and a heart
Who was that with that old man?
Well, I think I know.
