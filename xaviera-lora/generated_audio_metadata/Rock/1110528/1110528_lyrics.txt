Does the lightning bring the thunder
Does the thunder bring the rain
Lighting up the sky with wonder
Till the whole world is aflame
I'm bringing the fire
Gonna make it burn higher
I'm bringing the thunder
Ain't gonna go under
You say I'm weak and just a bother
You dismiss so easily
I'm a sister, I'm a daughter
I am not your enemy
I'm bringing the fire (I'm bringing the fire)
Gonna make it burn higher
I'm bringing the thunder (I'm bringing the thunder)
Ain't gonna go under
Will you listen?
Do you hear me?
I'm bringing the fire
Gonna make it burn higher
I'm bringing the thunder
Ain't gonna go under
I'm bringing the power
Oh this is my hour
I'm bringing the fire
Does the lightning bring the thunder
Does the thunder bring the rain
