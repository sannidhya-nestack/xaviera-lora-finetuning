Like a stone that sinks to the bottom of the water
No particular direction at all
Not aware of any purpose or meaning
I'm stretching out for my aimless free fall to you
Like a chime chimes when you brush up against it
Like a poet don't know it when all rhyme goes to reason
I've had my fill of mindin' what I'm after
Riddin' myself of self I'm dead
You're the riverbed and I'm sinking to you
Time takes you away from me again
I get pulled down to the bottom of the sea
When you look up next miss ocean floor
You'll be staring at a sinking stone like a me yeah
Like a car from the city
Looking for a place to part
In a suburb somewhere outside
Veins of a busted arrow heart
Find a space since you've known me since I've been ten
I wanna kiss her, she's heading up north
As my good friend again
My good friend again
In a van on the road
In a house by the shore
I buy my stop time just the same as before
Like a wine from a cellar
Waiting to be sipped upon
You can excuse my romantic side
If it seems like I'm coming on
Well maybe I am
Maybe I'm not
You know when my love of all time
Takes you away from me again
I get pulled down to the bottom of the sea
When you look up next to this ocean floor
You'll be staring at a sick and stone like a me
