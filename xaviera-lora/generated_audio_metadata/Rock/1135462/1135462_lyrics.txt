Why, oh why did you throw it all away?
My, oh my, all the thoughts of yesterday
It's a crime, baby you have crossed the line
Day by day
Trying to move up on the head
It's too late
Can't et those words you said
Say goodbye
Baby you have crossed the line
You are crossed the line
Why oh why
Can't you take it like a man
Man oh man
I'm surprised you don't understand
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Baby you have crossed the line
*Demonic Screaming *
