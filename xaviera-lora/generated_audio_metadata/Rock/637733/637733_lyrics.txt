So life's a game, when can we play with yours?
With just a flick of the needle, we're sure to best our scores
And as it fades, I'll veil our skins
It's a mark for the ages
Let the games begin
Yeah we're so in
So you think you're the shit
Well, there's something in the air
It's just a drop in the water
But you sense its presence there
And from the deep of the rising seas
A mystic abrasion will soon be surfacing
Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it, raise your voice
Fifteen fading, ripped away
We've all got something to say
Is there a voice that whispers on the wind
A subtle symptom of conscience
Of cold indifference thin
It's the world that lights my tongue
For self-indulged reservations, not what we've become
Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it, raise your voice
Fifteen fading, ripped away
We've all got something to say
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it, raise your voice
Fifteen fading riffs away
We've all got something to say
