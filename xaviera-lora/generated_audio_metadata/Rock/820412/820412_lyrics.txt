Take me to the river, throw me in the water, I ain't afraid to drown
Sun on the horizon melting like a can, but slowly it's going down
Oh now
In your killer eyes
Know you're airing the windy hands on my chest
On your lips are the sun and mine are the west
Waiting for the day to close
Staring into the night
Your pure eyes are fading into my free will
Your pure eyes take black and they make it blue
And they know I'm fallin' for you
Well tonight
Well tonight
Your killer eyes are the stones on the eastern hills
Your killer eyes are fading but my faith will
Your killer eyes take black and they make it through, oh no
Your killer eyes
Your killer eyes are the storms on the eastern hills
Your killer eyes are fading in my free will
Your killer eyes stay black in the naked room
Oh no, they know I'm falling for you
Oh, now
Oh, now
You're killing us
Oh, you're killing us
Killing us
Oh you can't run, no
