I'm hearing so many voices in my head
They keep waking me up
And now I'm tossing and turning in my bed
It's shaking me up
And I know it's too late now
I can't turn back time
Hearts on the line
And it's driving me crazy
I can't take anymore
When I think that I'm getting higher
She takes me down, down
She lights me up like a fire
Then burns me down
It's freaking me out
It's four AM in the morning
And there's her text
She never gives up
She's in and out and she's over
She's the best at playing me up
And I know it's too late now
I can't turn back time
It's love on the line
And she's driving me crazy
I can't take anymore
When I think that I'm getting higher
She takes me down, down
And when it comes right down to the wire
She won't back down, down
She takes me over a mountain and turns me around, around
She lights me up like a fire that burns me down, she's freaking me out
I never thought I would go down on this ride (on this ride)
How can something so wrong feel so right?
I get so high (I get so high)
Just when I'm getting higher
She takes me down, down
And when it comes right down to the wire
She won't back down, down
She takes me over the mountain
Then right back around, around
She lights me up like a fire
Then burns me down
She's freaking me out
