I was drowning when you pulled me to the surface
I was lower than I'd ever been before
You were shining through the darkness all around me
You were guiding me straight back to the shore
Now I'm blinded by the sight of your white lightning
And my silhouette it just don't look the same
Yeah you take me from the dark and open up my eyes
Did you blind me, blind me with white lightning
I was looking for a major situation
I was looking for something profound
You were hoping for a simple complication
You were dragging me up from off the ground
Now I'm blinded by the sight of your white lightning
And my silhouette it just don't look the same
Yeah, you take me from the dark
And open up my eyes
Then you blind me
Blind me with white lightning, yeah
Yeah, you take me from the dark and open up my eyes
Then you blind me, blind me with white lightning
I'm in a haze, you turn me inside out
You got me under your spell
You open up my eyes
And then you blind me with white lightning
Blind me with white lightning
Blind me with white lightning
Blind me with white lightning
Blind me with your lightning
Blind me with white lightning
Blind me with white lightning
