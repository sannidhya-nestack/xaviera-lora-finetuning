When I know you're close to me
The world can merely fade away
Every bit of sound goes over my head
And I can't hear a word you say
I feel the ground shake under my feet
Every time that you glance my way
Nothing on earth could ever come close
When I hold you everything's okay
Oh, nothing's been the same since you came along
Oh, oh
I've gotta tell you, I've gotta tell you
We fit together, we fit together just right
We fit together, no one else can deny
We fit together, we fit together just right
When I know you're close to me
The world can merely fade away
Every bit of sound goes over my head
And I can't hear a word you say
Oh, nothing's been the same since you came along
Oh, oh
I've gotta tell you, I've gotta tell you
We fit together, we fit together just right
We fit together, no one else can deny
We fit together, we fit together just right
We fit together
We fit together just right
There is no one more beautiful than you tonight
We fit together
We fit together just right
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We fit together, we fit together just right
We fit together, no one else can deny
We fit together, we fit together just right
