Beware my friend don't run to the end
I'll never see you again
Keep it up you'll soon be there
I'll never see you again
Your eyes are darker, body's cringing
Your hands are shaking, can't stand much longer
Soon you're just a shadow in the dark
I'll never see you again
I see you from another point of view
I wish that you could look through my eyes
No words to bring it out
You'll soon be there
I'll never see you again
Your eyes are darker
Body's cringing
Your hands are shaking
Can't stand much longer
Soon you're just a shadow in the dark
I'll never see you again
