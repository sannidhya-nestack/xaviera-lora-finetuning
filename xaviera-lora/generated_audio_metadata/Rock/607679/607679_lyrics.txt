When did life become so real
Everyday everyone is hurting more
Oh, you think that God is just a state of mind
You find him after everything is lost
Where you going?
Tell me where you're going
I wish I could relate to everything that's hurting
Tell me where you're going
Tell me where you're going
I wish I could be there
I wish I could be there
It's coming at you fast, don't panic
What you've been looking forward to, it's tragic
Don't let go, second chances are so hard to come by
Live it and don't let it die
Where you going?
Tell me where you're going
I wish I could relate to everything that's hurting
Tell me where you're going
Tell me where you going
I wish I could be there
I wish I could be there
Tell me you are terrified
You are paralyzed
You can't be
And you are breaking through the walls that hold you
You are free
Where you growing
Tell me where you growing
I wish I could relate to everything that's hurting
Tell me where you growing
Tell me where you growing
I wish I could be there
I wish I could be there
Ooh, ooh, ooh
