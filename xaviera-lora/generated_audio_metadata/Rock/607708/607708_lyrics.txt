Where, oh where, where were the others when you said it loud
To the barricades, hi again, you're back already
The words wouldn't last, you're just like the others
You're all blowin' smoke, you and the other ones
Hi again, it just won't happen
Where, oh where, where were the others when you said it loud
To the barricade time again, you're back already
The words wouldn't last, you're just like the others, you're all blow and smoke, you and the other ones hot again, it just won't happen, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
These people, they won't last
It's gonna break my heart
With their tight ropes of earth and ice always
And everyone, everyone
We're gonna die too young
We're victims of appointments and limits
And we're not laughing
Where oh where are the others?
To the barricades, to the barricades
Hi again, you're back already
These people, they won't last
It's gonna break my heart
With their tight robes of earth and ice always
And everyone, everyone
We're gonna die too young
We're victims of appointments and limits
We're not laughing, we're just, we don't laugh no more
And we're not laughing
