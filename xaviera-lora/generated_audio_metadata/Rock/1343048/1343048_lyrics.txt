Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Warm bass hums
Silver chords in bloom
Footsteps on a groove that clears the gloom
You spark a laugh that lifts the night
Little notes lining up just right
Every wall turns soft and thin
Doorways open, we drifting
You tilt the world with a simple line
Low voice sailing clean and fine
I catch the glow where your rhythm moves
Find my place in the pocket of your grooves
Raise the key, let the skyline rise
Feel the lift running through our eyes
Light up the room when you move, when you move
Turn up the groove, let it bloom, let it bloom
Say it for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Clap to the beat, sing it back, sing it back
Lock with the bass, never slack, never slack
Say you're for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Oh oh, light it up, light it up
Oh oh, I can't get enough
You thread a smile through the melody spine
Simple as daylight through a blind
No grand parade, just truth that stays
Quiet sparks shaping better days
I feel the floor turn bold and bright
Steps align and the world feels light
Raise the key, let the skyline rise
Feel the lift running through our eyes
Light up the room when you move, when you move
Turn up the groove, let it bloom, let it bloom
Say you're for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Clap to the beat, sing it back, sing it back
Lock with the bass, never slack, never slack
Say it for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Shift the chord and let the ceiling bend
Count it off, feel the corners blend
Every doubt goes soft and small
Faith comes forward, ten feet tall
We don't need grand design or proof
Only this rise in the roof
Light up the room
Stay, move, how, you, move, true, through
And through room lights for you
Light up the room when you move, when you move
Turn up the groove, let it bloom, let it bloom
Say you're for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Clap to the beat, sing it back, sing it back
Lock with the bass, never slack, never slack
Say you're for real, make it true, make it true
Light up the room, I light up with you
Warm bass fades as the chords hold true
Room still shining, me and you
