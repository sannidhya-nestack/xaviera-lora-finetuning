Running through the city streets
Chasing colors that I see
Blue and green and red so bright
They're lighting up the night
Everywhere they're shining bold
Yellow, orange, silver, gold
In the air around I find
Colors dancing in my mind
Chasing colors through the light
In the day and in the night
Paint my world in vivid hue
Every shade there's something new
When the skies are turning grey
All those colours fade away
But in my heart they'll always glow
In the dark they start to show
Neon lights and rainbows white
Colours make me feel alive
In a world that's full of grey
Chasing colours every day
Chasing colors through the light
In the day and in the night
Paint my world in vivid hue
Every shade there's something new
When the skies are turning grey
All those colours fade away
But in my heart they'll always glow
In the dark they start to show
Chasing colours through the light
In the day and in the night
Paint my world in vivid hue
Every shade there's something new
