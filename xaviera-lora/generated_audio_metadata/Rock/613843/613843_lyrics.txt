I got a friend who waits for me
I need to tell him all about my life
And someone who understands
I know it's all about looking in my eyes
That's alright, Mr. Wellington
Jacket back to the bar, make poison glasses
It's more than a friend
We talk to each other and I feel so fine
Jack is a devil in my head
I can feel his voice running through my veins
Now begin to turn around me
I hope to stand again on my last
Listen to me old Jack
Tell me just the one thing
Let me know the way
Try to stop my head
Load all the bottles, play the bell
Common guys is late, time is over
Three AM people say goodbye
Jack inside me wants to live all night
Drive-ins and trouble on the road
Police don't ive me anymore
Death's close to me, it takes my hand
Pray the lord to take me to my bed
Listen to me old Jack
Tell me just the one thing
Let me know the way
Try to stop my bed
Stop my bed
Yeah, stop my bed
