I bet there's nothing I can say to make you change
You're out of range, I disarrange
It's true that nothing's quite the same
Out of your reign
And out of frame
You've lost your flame
I spent so many years to learn and there is nothing left to fear
I'm out of here, I'm in the clear
Storm after storm
Love won't regrow
We were made to fall apart from the start
Seems to me that every secret we regret we never kept
Spoiled our youth, we lost the truth
And since we're liars in denial, we believe in what is right
We've seen the light, we're alright
We spent so many years contaminating everything
It's gone too far, I'm just a scar
Storm after storm
Love won't regrow
Born in the dark
We were made to fall apart
We were made to fall apart
We were made to fall apart
We were made to fall apart
From the start
