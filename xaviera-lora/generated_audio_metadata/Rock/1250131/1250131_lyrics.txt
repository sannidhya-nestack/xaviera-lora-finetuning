She's dark, trouble in her eyes
Wild heart, can't disguise
Can't stay put, she seeks thrills
Climbing up those endless hills
Sneaking out late at night
Dancing in the moonlight
No plan, just a whirlwind
With trouble but a true friend
Troublesome girl always on the run
Living life fast trying to catch the sun
Troublesome girl making waves so tall
Can't tame her spirit her fire won't fall
Skip school, no surprise
Daydreams, under skies
She's got dreams they won't hold
Breaking rules, she's pure gold
Meet her at the crossroads
She knows where the wind blows
No map, no tether, just fur and the weather
Troublesome girl, always on the run
Living life fast, tryna catch the sun
Troublesome girl, making waves so tall
Can't tame her spirit, her fire won't fall
Skip school no surprise
Daydreams under skies
She's got dreams they won't hold
Breaking rules she's pure gold
Near at the crossroads
She knows where the wind blows
No map no tether
Just her and the weather
Troublesome girl always on the run
Living life fast trying to catch the sun
Troublesome girl make it way so tall
Can't tame her spirit her fire will fall
