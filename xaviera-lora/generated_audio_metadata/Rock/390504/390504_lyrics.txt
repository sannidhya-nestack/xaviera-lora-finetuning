[MUSIC PLAYING]
When I got in the car, I did not know that I was in for spiritual awakening
Was at a time everything in my life wasn't shunning rubies or crimson bells
And I looked to the roads, few to follow that keeps on whining'til you're filled in the hollows
Reached for all the powers that be, riding right alongside of me
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning, burning
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning, burning
A good friend of mine came to my aid
And pulled me out of her sedentary state
She was feeling light and didn't mind the drive
Oh didn't mind that I had much to say
I've been through the loop, was down on my stride
High and low on some fancy flight
Laughing to myself, it's hard to conceive
The bridges of my life burning down into the sea
I'm, I'm driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning, burning
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning, burning
So I painted a picture for myself in my hand
I had a bag for every bag I ever dealt
And I found the jaded and the devils that I hated
And I shoved them deep to the bottom of the bag
And I put it in the heap, the tires went a-skitchin'
Man, I knew they were preachin'
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning (the bridges are burning)
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning (the bridges are burning, burning)
Driving down the highway
Behind me bridges are burning (the bridges are burning yeah)
I'm burning in, oh I'm driving down the highway
Behind me bridges, I'm burning in, I'm burning in, I'm driving down the highway
Behind me bridges, I'm burning in, I "m burning in, I'm driving down
