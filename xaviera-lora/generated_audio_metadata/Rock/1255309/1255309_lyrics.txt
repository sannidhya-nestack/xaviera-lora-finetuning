Uh-huh, Monday morning, alarms bearing
Same old routine, it's overbearing
But today feels different somehow
Got a fire inside, don't know how
I've been playing it safe for too long
It's time to sing my own song
No more following the crowd, it's time to get loud
I'm breaking out of my shell, got a story to tell
Gonna let my true colors show
And let the whole world know, don't we fit in?
Time to let my life begin
Watch me as I spread my wings and fly
This is my battle cry
They said I couldn't, so I did
Broke the mold, flipped the lid
Downright in my own rules, now I'm playing the fool
I found the strength that was once hiding
Now my fears are subsiding
It's my time to take the stage, time to turn the page
I'm breaking out of my shell, got a story to tell
Gonna let my true colors show
And let the whole world know I'm done with sitting in
It's time to let my life begin
Watch me as I spread my wings and fly
This is my battle cry
Every doubt, every fear, every tear
Disappear, I'm standing tall, standing strong
This is where I belong
With no more hiding, no more shame
Time to fan this inner flame
I'm breaking out of my shell
Got a story to tell
Gonna let my true colors show
And let the whole world know
Don't waste waiting in
Time to let my life begin
Watch me as I spread my wings and fly
This is my battle cry
