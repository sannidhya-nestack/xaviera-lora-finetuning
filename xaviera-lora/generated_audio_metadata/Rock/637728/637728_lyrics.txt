Fortune lives we lead with no pondering minds
For descent or burden
Degrees from the yield to seed
Or the sobering tomb of squander
Unheeded the paths that lead us through process aligned with patent effect we need
This distance to help us sleep
And peers to absolve
The turbulent wake it leaves over space and time
Now rippling to peace
And feed it in ways unknown
Far above our means
Despair it imparting
Then heed it in words alone
Sell the moments
Pause to wonder
The wonders are waste you'll find
If we follow the web of lines
We're just lost in the crowd
Our imprints reel
Though often far from view
How can we say it's our lust for more but feel less too?
Six steps to save our eyes
Far removed'neath these self-same skies
The sea of faces will wash it away
Leaving peace for one more day
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
