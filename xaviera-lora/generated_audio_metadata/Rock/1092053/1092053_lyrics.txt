Short-haired boys with thin guitars
Long neck blondes in rented cars
Sunset nights and neon days
Tower records, Dylan plays
Apartments full of chic debris
Players preach philosophy
Valley queens and hollow jacks
Drink delusions
On the rocks
L .A. crucifixion
Everything is nothing in this town
L .A. crucifixion
They hang you upside down
Purple sun through morning fog
Bottled air to beat the smog
Ancient stars in bungalows
Wearing other people's clothes
Every year a different speech
Every dream just out of reach
For a mental souvenir
Come to L .A. for a year
L .A. crucifixion
Everything is nothing in this town
L .A. crucifixion
They hang you upside down
