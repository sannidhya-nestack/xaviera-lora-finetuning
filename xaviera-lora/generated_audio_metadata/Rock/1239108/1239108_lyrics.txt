Ooh, don't be afraid, mm-mm, mm-mm
Let your soul be your guide, mm-mm
Don't try to fight it, oh
Just flow with the tide
Let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
Seasons may change
But he never will
When your plans rearrange
I'll be here for you still
Let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let him go
Let go, let go, let him go
Oh
Break free from his chains
Move into the change
Intense is the pain
But in time that will change
Let him go
