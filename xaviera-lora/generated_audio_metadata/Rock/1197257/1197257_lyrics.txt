Can you feel my eyes on you
As you walk across the room
I wanna know your every thought
I'm on fire when we don't talk
Your sweet scent fills the air
I still smell you everywhere
Pure desire all the way
I dream of hearing you say
Sit to sleep with your eyes
Pull your body close to mine
Let me be your fantasy
Over and over again
Sit to sleep
I'll seduce me, oh
Learning all your wants and needs
Till you fall down in love with me
You're the hunter, I'm your prey
Can't wait to hear you say
Seduce me with your eyes
Pull your body close to mine
Let me be your fantasy
Over and over again
Seduce me
I'm satisfied, oh
Watching from the sidelines
You don't know it yet
I'm the one you'll never et
Can't live to you
Seduce me with your lies
Pull your body close to mine
Let me be your fantasy
Over and over and over again
Seduce me
Oh, seduce me, seduce me
Oh, seduce me, oh
