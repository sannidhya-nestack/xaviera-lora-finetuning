In awkward silence
Your whispered promise echoes in my mind
Tamed as madness
The truth bleeds through beyond your perfect sky
For the light, I'll break free from all this chains and
Pull you out, ashes in the rain, every night
I will cherish the remaining
Perfect scars
Free from all this pain
Walk through this fire
The mirror cracks with every hit or lie
No denying
The words unspoken are your only mine
I'm a liar
I'll break free from all these chains and
Burn your lies
Ashes in the rain
Every night
I will cherish the remaining
Perfect skies
Free from all this pain
Ashes in the rain
Ashes in the rain
