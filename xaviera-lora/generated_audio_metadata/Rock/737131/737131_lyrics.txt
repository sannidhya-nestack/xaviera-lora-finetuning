Absence makes the heart go wander
I ain't hanging around no longer
I've spent one too many nights
Waiting up for you
Here's one more thing for you to ponder
While you search the white blue yonder
Absence makes the heart go wander
Now I'm gone for good
Cook you dinner then I toss it
You're worse than a leaky faucet
Running all night long now boy I'm drained
Tried to keep our love light burning
But you leave without returning
Now I'm learning to can't play your game
Absence makes the heart go wander
I ain't hanging round no longer
I spent one too many nights waiting up for you
Here's one more thing for you to ponder
While you search the white blue yonder
Absence makes the heart go wander
Now I'm gone for good
You want your freedom, you say you need it
You can have your cake and eat it too
Now do you think I'll stand in line?
Out away from no man ever
You can't run around forever
Bet you'll never find cake sweet as mine
Absence makes the heart go wander
I ain't hanging'round no longer
I've spent one too many nights waiting up for you
Here's one more thing for you to find out
Why you search so wildly under
Absence makes the heart go wander
Now I'm gone for good
Absence makes the heart go wander, I ain't hangin'round no longer
I've spent one too many nights waitin' up for you
Here's one more thing for you to ponder, why you search so wide beyond you
Absence makes the heart go wander, now I'm gone for good
Absence makes the heart go wander, now I'm gone for good
