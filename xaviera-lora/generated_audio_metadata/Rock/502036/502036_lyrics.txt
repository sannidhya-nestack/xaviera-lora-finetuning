Spent the day beside the stream
With fish that makes those splashes out of swimming dreams
Or birds don't mind if we're heard on the radio
And I'll watch the flowers as they dodge the breeze
And I'll dive in with the energy to climb the trees
As pebbles smile to tongues, I'll never know
it's in the look, the way I watch the sunshine
Sitting in a patch of grass, I claim this mind
That makes me feel like finding my own way
And if I should, should say I'm not myself
A china doll sitting on a dusty shelf
Will remind me if I'm holding, I'm okay
It's less of a bad night now than day
Past the trees and behind the lake
Laughing at the ripples, dogs sleeping awake
who knows just what else I'll ever see
Oh and I'm not alone so I must have friends
In the sun and optimism gets here in the end
That's the sound of thunder clapping
Reaches down out through the trees'cause it's in the
The way we watch the sun shine
Sitting in a patch of grass acclaimed is mine
That makes me feel like finding my own way
And if I should, should stay home by myself
A china doll sitting on a dusty shelf will remind me
If I'm home then I'm okay
It's less of a bad night now than day
'Cause it's in the weather, watch the sunshine
Sitting in a patch of grass, I claimed it was mine
But it makes me feel like finding my own way
And if I should, should say I'm not myself
A china doll sitting on a dusty shelf
Would remind me if I'm whole and I'm okay
It's less about night now than day
And I hope that that's okay
And I hope that that's okay
And I hope that that's my way
And I hope that that's my way (And I hope that that's my way)
I know that it's not over
And I hope that that's my way (And, I hope that that's my way)
You know what I think in a
And I hope that that's my way (And. I hope that that's my way)
You know what I think, I know that it's not over
And I hope that that's my way
