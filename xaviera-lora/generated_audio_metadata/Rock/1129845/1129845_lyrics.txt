She saw the famous sign
When she was only nine
From the back seat of the car
It spelled out Hollywood
She swore someday she would
Come back here and be a star
The place where dreams come true
Stars born every day
The place where players come to play
Welcome to LA
Westbound at twenty-one
She chased the setting sun
Left the town she called a curse
Her whole world in her car
New clothes and old guitar
Two thousand dollars in her purse
She would feel things out and find a place to stay
Destiny was on the way to meet her in LA
Welcome to La La Land, sunshine and sea and sand
Have a drink, we'll show you in
Make yourself at home
You might just get the part
We see you have the heart
But you might need to show some skin
Before we let you in
She thought she'd played the game
The phone call never came
She started dancing at some bar
Some guys were pretty nice
Found trouble once or twice
She never thought she'd fall this far
She truly seen the world where players come to play
Where broken dreams are on display
She's heartbroken LA
Heartbroken LA
A heartbroken LA
