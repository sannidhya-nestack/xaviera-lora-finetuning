Feel like a lazy good for nothing
But since it's been becoming clear
That you're tired of me and you're planning
To get the hell out of here
I stare at my breakfast cereal
the flakes know how I feel
I'm an undesired meal headed for the drain
Isn't it ordinary
Falling for someone like you?
Isn't it ordinary
I'm one of the chosen few?
I was there first when nobody knew
It was my curse believing in you
I helped you burn all the bad reviews
Oh but everybody loves you now
When it brushes you
The touch of my skin has an effect
Not unlike a mop
I feel as sexy as two kids at the drive-in
Parked next to a cop
I don't want to bring it up, I just want you to stay
There's a conflict here that I'm trying to steer clear
Like a deer on a dark freeway, I don't know what to say
Isn't it ordinary, falling for someone like you?
Isn't it ordinary, I'm one of the chosen few?
I was there first when nobody knew
It was my curse believing in you
I helped you burn all the bad reviews
Oh but everybody loves you now
I just want to move you babe like old times
But now you say you hate poetry that rhymes
You dunk me, you make your splash in the pond
A stepping stone for you to keep traveling on
Oh your mind is closed like a bouncers fist
You stole all my songs and took me off the guest list
Now I'm left without a ticket to your sold out shows
Hiding from the bouncer with a broken nose
Didn't even get to bow after the curtain closed
Isn't it ordinary falling for someone like you?
Isn't it ordinary I'm one of the chosen few?
I was there first when nobody knew
It was my curse believing in you
I helped you burn all the bad reviews, oh
But everybody loves you now
Everybody loves you now
Everybody loves you now
