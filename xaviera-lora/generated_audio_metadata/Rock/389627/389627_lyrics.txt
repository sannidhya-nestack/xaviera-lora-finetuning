Mmm, it's so quiet in this house
It's oh so peaceful and quiet in this pretty house
There's no hurt and there's no anger
There's no greed and there's no hunger
Ah, shh, love's asleep
She's a dying flower, so carelessly misfed
She's a dying power, so easily misled
There's no rage, there's no passion
I guess I'm simply out of fashion
Should we kill it? Or just let it slowly die?
Should we plead for it? To try and keep it alive?
Should we worship it? Or should we just keep ignoring it?
Oh, shhh, love's a salute
I still love you, yeah
I still love you, yeah
I still love you, yeah
(Phew, shh, now it's a saint)
She walks into the ocean, she does not look back
She wears that long line white dress, and she doesn't look back
She doesn't cry more
she knows that it's too late
And as sure as the sun burns tomorrow
She'll soon reincarnate
She'll soon reincarnate
She'll soon reincarnate
She'll soon reincarnate
I'm still alive, yeah, I'm still alive, yeah
I'm still alive, yeah, I'm still alive, yeah
