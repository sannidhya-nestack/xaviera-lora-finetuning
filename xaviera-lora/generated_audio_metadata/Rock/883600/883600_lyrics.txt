This cancer's got me weak
And I can hardly speak
I wish that I could show you how I feel
This pain that you don't know
You just won't let me go
Because then it would become so real
I'm fading like color in the dark
Time is wasting, surrendering my heart
It's breaking, my final goodbye
Body is shaking, flying high
I'm flying high
Each day I'm suffering
Please just set me free
If only you could see the pain inside of me
I'm fading like color in the dark
Time is wasting, surrendering my heart
It's breaking, my final goodbye
Body is shaking, flying high
I'm flying high, flying high
I'm flying high
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I-I-I-I-I-I-I
The skin just got me weak
And I can hardly speak
