Gather round, inspired Avengers
Let us mold and entertain
Tales of righteousness and the guidance of salvation
Fables of the beasts we've slain
For the foes we've devastated
For the families left for dead
For the hypocrites and their wide-eyed aberrations
And the virtuous days ahead
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no fading
Once so beautiful
Now so meaningless
A mutual plight's methodologies, passions, beginnings
They can't see
And all they do
That they're just like you
So here's to lies my brother sold me
Here's to truths I should have known
To awful thoughts and memories
Regretful lamentations
Kneel before your consequences pray
For the seeds we could have sown
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no fading
Once so beautiful, now so meaningless
One's spawning dread, one breeds fear
No one sees, no one's winning
But believe in all I do
I'm just like you
Where the line cuts through the chaos
Where it fractures, this is your loss
Transparent polar filters are split down the screen
We can highlight just how kindred
We see
The dust on the shades masks the blood
Though it fades there's no thinning
Once so beautiful, now so meaningless
Reflections of greed, mirrors not meditations
Misgivings
This is real
And for all you knew, he was just like you
