I grew up in a two-stop light town
With no idea that I'd ever be big city bound
All the cars, people, and traffic think I've had my fill
Think I'm ready to go back to Pumpkinville
There's nothing in a city that there ain't more of in a smaller town
People everywhere act the same when the sun goes down
Some think the city is more violent and has a harder core
But things happen in small town that don't make the evening news report
Some people think that small towners don't have a clue
I can tell you that small towners they know a thing or two
City slick small town hicks really all the same gold figure
And a city ain't really nothing but a small town that's a whole lot bigger
But a small town has a memory that is ages old
But the city ets yesterday's news shortly after it's told
And your small town friends, they'll stick with you your whole life
Sometimes your city friends all scatter with the morning light
I grew up in a two stop light town
With no idea that I'd ever be big city bound
All the cars, people and traffic
I think I've had my fill
Think I'm ready to go back to bumpkinville
Think I'm ready to go back to Pumpkinville
Think I'm ready to go back to Pumpkinville
