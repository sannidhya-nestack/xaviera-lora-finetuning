I was at home minding my own business
Watching some late night TV
I heard a knock on my door
I was not expecting the sight I would see
And there she was, that woman I loved
The last weekend she left me flat
Tears in her eyes now she apologized
Knowing I'd gladly take her back
I'm her true blue fool
She can't count on me
To let her break all the rules
She's all I need and I'll always be her true blue fool
When she holds my hand
No other man could be feeling as good as I do
No other kiss could make me feel like this
That's why I'll always see her through
I'm her true boo-foo
She can't count on me
To let her break all the rules
She's all I need and I'll always be her true boo-hoo
I'm her true blue fool
She can't count on me
To let her break all the rules
She's all I need and I'll always be her true blue fool
She's all I need and I'll always be her true blue fool
Some people say I'm crazy to stay
I'm her true blue fool
Yes, I'm her true blue fool
