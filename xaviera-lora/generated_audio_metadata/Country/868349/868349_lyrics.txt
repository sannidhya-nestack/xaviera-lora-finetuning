Underneath the starlit G ia sky
Me and my girl, dancing on the rooftop
Chillin' on a Friday night
And darling when you're standing here
It's like the whole world disappears
And the stars dangle like chandeliers
And we're shaking it up at a rooftop club
Drinking champagne, gonna get me some
Good times, good times, girl you won't be sorry
We can have a good time, good time
Love is like, love is like a party
Love is like a party, out'til tomorrow
Up all night'til Monday morning
Celebrate every day
We'll dance to the rhythm the DJ plays
Turn the volume up, I can't get enough
Baby we can dance'til tomorrow
Girl you got the best pink party dress, mmm
Let's get this party started, oh, oh
Love is like, love is like a party
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's get this party started
It all started with a "Hey girl, what's good?"
You were standing all alone, staring at your phone
Laughing out loud at a Facebook post
And ever since the day we met
You've been painting the town with the red carpet
Taking selfies just to make our friends upset
Sitting on the front of my pickup truck
Summer, summer loving gonna get me some
Good times, good times
Girl you won't be sorry
We can have a
Good times, good times
Love is like, love is like a party
Love is like a party out'til tomorrow up all night'til Monday morning

I want to feel your body move
I want to see you lose control
I want to be you rock and roll
Dance to the rhythm of the radio

Turn the volume up in my pickup truck
