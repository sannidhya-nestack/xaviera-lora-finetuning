Brother, pull up a chair if you want
You can sit right there, pour a drink
And listen all night long
Shut your eyes, give it half a chance
You'll think you're in Paris, France instead of Paris
Texas all along
The people come from miles around to hear us play
That gypsy sounded swing played on fiddle and guitar
Me oh my, how the hours fly when we play guitar like that Django guy
We'll make you et just where you are
Texas Gypsies, Texas Gypsies
We wander all around the lone star state
Texas Gypsies, Texas Gypsies
We hope you'll come to see us when we play
Sister, it don't mean a thing unless it's got that minor swing
Each note we play is gonna make you smile
So sit right down and shut your boosh
And listen up to that jazz minutia
As we play that gypsy music, Texas style
Texas gypsies, Texas gypsies
We wander all around the lone star state
Texas Gypsies, Texas Gypsies
We hope you'll come to see us when we play
