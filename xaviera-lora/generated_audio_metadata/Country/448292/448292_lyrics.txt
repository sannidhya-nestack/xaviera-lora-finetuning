Well, I'm up and down and I'm high and low
I'm stuck somewhere between touch and go
From the moment you left right away I knew
I'm never gonna stop loving you
No, I'm never ever gonna stop loving you
I told my heart the day you said goodbye, it's over
And all I need is some time and I'll be okay
Just when my feet get firmly planted on the ground
And all it takes is to hear your name
To turn them into clay
Well, I'm up and down and I'm high and low
I'm stuck somewhere between touch and go
From the moment you left right away I knew
I'm never gonna stop loving you
No, I'm never ever gonna stop loving you
My friends all tell me I should leave the past behind
And give my broken heart a chance to mend
It's been a long time since I've cried those lonely tears
But here comes your memory and here I go
It's no wonder that I'm up and down and I'm high and low
I'm stuck somewhere between touch and go
From the moment you left right away I knew
I'm never gonna stop loving you
No, I'm never ever gonna stop love
I'm never, I'm never, I'm never ever gonna stop loving you
I'm never, I'm never, I'm never ever gonna stop loving you, yeah
