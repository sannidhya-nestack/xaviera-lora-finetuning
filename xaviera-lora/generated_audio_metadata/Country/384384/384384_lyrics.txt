There's a hall of fame in Nashville
For the biggest country stars
Cleveland's got the hall of rock and roll
The NFL, the NBA, the boys of summer all
Even NASCAR where the legends will still roll
But there's a place out in the wall where the stars will never fade
It's closer to the home and to the heart
Memories wrapped in simple frames and hung up on a wall
And every day I get to see them as I'm walking down my hall
Now to the world they might be unknowns nobody knows their names
But to all their friends and family Lord their fame is just the same
I just hope that one day I'll be big enough to hang
My picture with the others in my family's hall of fame
There's Grandpa and Lord as stories of how life used to be
A history lesson in a rocking chair
And Grandma's jams and jellies they were known for miles around
And even won blue ribbons at the county fair
Daddy was a working man, didn't have a lot of time
Now and then he'd take us to fishing hole
And Mama's special nursing at the center of it all
Even cuts and bumps and bruises to our bodies and our souls
To the world they might be unknowns, nobody knows their names
But to all their friends and family, lo, their fame is just the same
And I just hope that one day I'll be big enough to hang
My picture with the others in my family's hall of fame
And maybe one day I'll join the stars in my family's hall of fame
