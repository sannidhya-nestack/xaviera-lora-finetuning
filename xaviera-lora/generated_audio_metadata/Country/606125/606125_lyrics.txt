You look at me and see a sweet young thing
I promise you, you ain't seen nothing
Turn out the lights, move back the furniture
I'll show you things you've never seen before
I want a rough and tumble love
I wonder if you're tough enough
Shake, push and shove, show me your stuff
I want a rough and tumble love
There comes a time in a good girl's life
She throws away all that sugar and spice
Learns to cook in a different pot
Turns up the heat, takes her best shot
I wanna rough and tumble love
I wonder if you're tough enough
Shake, push and shove
Show me your stuff
I wanna rough and tumble love
Rock my world, set me on fire
The flame of love is burning, burning higher
I want a rough and tumble love
I wonder if you're tough enough
Shake, push and shove
Show me your stuff
I want a rough and tumble love
You look at me and see a sweet young thing
I promise you, you ain't seen nothing
Turn out the lights, move back the furniture
I'll show you things you've never seen before
I want a rough and tumble love
I wonder if you're tough enough
Shake, push and shove
Show me your stuff
I want a rough and tumble love
Rough and tumble, it's a jungle out there
Oh, rough and tumble, it's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
Oh, rough and tumble, it's a jungle out there
