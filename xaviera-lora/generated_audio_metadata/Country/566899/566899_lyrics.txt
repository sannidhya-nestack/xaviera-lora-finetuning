I tried it all to get it right
Is there something left to see?
I gotta laugh'cause I can't get enough
Of what crazy's been doing for me
She said time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for me
Baby, can't you see that you're gone?
What you got, what you need, feel like a hit of steam
Turn it up so I can't hear a sound
Baby nothing was something to me
She said time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for me
Baby can't you see that you're gone
Straight lines or the real hard signs
Can't find where I lost my time
Old shoes with the late night blues
Love tries if you win or you lose
Shut it down, light'em up
I ain't wasting no more, fine
We can talk about the end of the world but my love I ain't leaving you behind
Time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for me
Baby can't you see that we're gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Time won't wait for you
Time won't wait for me
Baby, can't you see that we're gone
Gone
