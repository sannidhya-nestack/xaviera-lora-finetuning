Oh here I go
No force of nature can hold me down
My feet are tired of solid ground
My knees are shaking but that's all gone
I found my courage I'm feeling strong
The sky's the limit gotta shed this town
I'm ready to do what I want to do
Spread my wings and fly away, yeah
Held back too long, it's time to say so long
My world's about to change
I'm ready to spread my wings, oh yeah
This guilty cage has crammed my style
I'm breaking out, I'm feeling wild
Wanna put the top back, wind in my hair
This free bird's leaving, she's going somewhere
I'm taking off, just watch me now
I'm ready to do what I wanna do
Spread my wings and fly away, yeah
Held back too long, it's hard to stay so long
My world's about to change
I'm ready to spread my wings
Give this free spirit a chance to ride the wind
In no time I'll be soaring
To heights I've never been
I'm ready to
I'm ready to do what I wanna do
Spread my wings and fly away
Held back too long, it's time to say so long
My world's about to change
I'm ready to spread my wings (I'm ready to spread my wings)
I'm ready to spread my wings (I'm ready to spread my wings)
I'm ready to spread my wings
