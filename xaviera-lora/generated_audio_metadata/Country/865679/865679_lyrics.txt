You're standing there smiling at me
What are you waiting for?
We could fall in love so easily
What are you waiting for?
I know that you've been alone for so long
Now make your move, nothing's going to go wrong
Let's give love a whirl
What in the world are you waiting for?
et all the tears in the past
What are you waiting for?
It's your turn for laughter at last
What are you waiting for?
Oh no, I'm not playing games or pretending
This time the plot has a happy ending
The boy gets the girl
So what in the world are you waiting for?
It's not only you who's been hurting
I've waited through lonely nights too
But I'll let that pain go
at long last I know
What I have been waiting for
I've been waiting for you
What are you waiting for?
I'm waiting for you
What are you waiting for?
Oh no, I'm not playing games or pretending
This time the plot has a happy ending
The boy gets the girl
So what in the world are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you, what are you, what are you, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
