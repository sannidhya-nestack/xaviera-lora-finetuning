She was a beautiful bride all dressed in white
With this ring I thee wed
She smiled and said I do
She swore to be true
Then came the kids and the laundry
Now she's feeling used
He's on the road out of town
And she's so confused tonight
About what's wrong and what's right
Then she lays one gold ring on the dresser
And after two rings on the phone
Three lives changed forever
How she's not spending the night alone
Now it's one, too many lovers, a three ring circus
One act follows another and there you are
Balancing lines on tightrope alibis
It's the greatest show on earth for broken hearts
And now for better or worse her feelings come first
So she's arranging for sitters and candlelight dinners for two
Another rendezvous
She takes one quick look at a picture
The one of her in that long white gown
Then after one long look in the mirror
Just for a second she sees a cloud
now it's one too many lovers
A three ring circus
One act follows another, and there you are
Balancing lines on high-profile abides
It's the greatest show on earth for broken hearts
Balancing lines on tightrope alibis
It's the greatest show on earth for broken hearts
