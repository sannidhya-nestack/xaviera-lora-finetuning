Woke up at dawn this morning, sun all aglow
I couldn't wait to get out into the day
Clear blue sky above me
Green earth below
Next thing I knew I heard myself say
Hey I'm having a good time
Don't you know that I feel fine
This whole world is mine
And everything is okay
Yeah I'm wearing a big smile
Living life country style
Loving it all the while
And man I just got to say
It's a beautiful day, hooray
It's a beautiful day, hooray
It's a beautiful day, hooray
It's a beautiful day
Pulled into town tonight, on the road again
The band was singing Hank and Merle all the way
And when I saw those bright lights shining, and crowd pouring in
I couldn't wait to get out here on the stage
And I'm having a good time
Don't you know that I feel fine
This whole world is mine
And everything is okay
Yeah I'm wearing a big smile
A living life country style
Loving it all the while
And man I just got to say
It's a beautiful day hooray
It's a beautiful day hooray
It's a beautiful day hooray
It's a beautiful day
Such a day is so blessed
It's a dream coming true
But the part I like best
I get to share it with you
And we're having a good time
Everyone's feeling fine
This whole world is yours and mine
And everything is okay
We're all wearing a big smile
Living life country style
Loving it all the while
So let me hear you all say
It's a beautiful day, hooray, it's a beautiful day, hooray
It's a beautiful day, hooray, it is a beautiful day
