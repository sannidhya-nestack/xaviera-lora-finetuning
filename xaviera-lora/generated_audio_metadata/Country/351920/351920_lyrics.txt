I'm tired
I picked up steam for a while but I'm broken
And I'm rough around the edges and just a little too outspoken
And I'm in trouble all the time
Even though I'm trying to do the right thing
I'm in the eye of the storm and in the middle of the thunder and the lightning
It happens all the time, a simple twist of fate
The things that cross my mind, I think but I won't say
Just tell me I'm iven for leaving you behind
And find the strength to let me go
I'm tired
And even though I'm tired
I wake up early in the morning and I drift off
I tell myself again today I think I'm finally going to lift off
And from my rocket to the stars I'm never looking back because I'm pissed off
That when I fly too close to the sun I guess my wings are going to trip off
It happens all the time, a simple twist of fate
The things that cross my mind
I think but I won't say
Just tell me I'm iven
For leaving you behind
And find the strength to let me go
And listen to your lullaby
Sleep now my darling
Close your eyes and let us live away
Sweet dreams surround you
So be strong until we meet again
We'll be together and we'll live forever as a day
Hush now baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna sing you a lullaby
I'm tired
I kept my faith for a while but it's jaded
I took my lumps with a smile but I've faded
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
5, 4, 3, 2
Ooh, I'm tired, it happens all the time
The simple twist of fate, the things that cross my mind
Are things that I won't say
Just tell me I'm iven for leaving you behind
And find the strength to let me go
Keep the faith and always know
That I will always love you so
