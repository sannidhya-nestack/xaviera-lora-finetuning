Some days I take a walk in time
Back through the memories I recall
And I see things I took for granted
But now they touch me most of all
A wandering stroll through time and places
Of you no memory is lost
They live within my very soul
I've kept them all at any cost
It's always been you
In every story of my life
Without your love
There's no meaning, it's just time
It's always been you
In every story of my life
Some may spend a lifetime searching
Never knowing what they'll find
And I thank all the stars above me
For a love like yours and mine
And as I wander through these memories
It's only yours that stands alone
And I'll keep them for a lifetime
Until they etch my name in stone
It's always been you
In every story of my life
Without your love
There's no meaning it's just time
It's always been you
In every story of my life
It's always been you
In every story of my life
You in every story of my life
