It's a good day to have a good day
The future ain't what it used to be
It's a good day
A celestial day
It brings out the devil in me
And if beer could talk
I'd be a millionaire
when God created you
He had a very good day
He saved the best'til last
So me and you can have a good day
It's a good day to sit in the sun
It's a perfect day to have lots of fun
It's a good day to tell everyone
It's a very good day to have a good day
When the darkness was falling in on me
And I could cut the night with a knife
It was a perfect day to say to my heart
Man up and face this life
I was drunk on dreams, I was paralyzed
When God made you for me
He had a very good day in a heavenly way
It was a good day to have a good day
Now it's a good day to sit in the sun
It's a perfect day to have lots of fun
It's a good day to tell everyone
It's a good day to have a good day
It's a good day, have a good day
You can't improve on perfection
You can't improve on love
God sent you in my direction
Now nothing can go wrong
Cause it's a good day to sit in the sun
It's a perfect day to have lots of fun
It's a good day to tell everyone
It's a good day to have a good day
It's a good day for kicking the blues
It's a good day for holding you
It's a perfect day for making plans with you
It's a very good day with you
It's a perfect day
It's a good day to have a good day
