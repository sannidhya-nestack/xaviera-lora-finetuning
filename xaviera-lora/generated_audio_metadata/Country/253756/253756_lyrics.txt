Well I'm full on my boots and my home blue jeans
Got a ticket to ride but I don't know what it means
Cause I'm a cowboy
Yeah I'm a cowboy
So I hop into my truck and head into the sun
You can see a silhouette of my rack and my gun
Cause I'm a cowboy
Yeah I'm a cowboy
I got a big bell buckle holding up my pants
And my head don't move during a two step dance
And I'm a mean looking horse with a nose spoofing kind of guy
Said I'm a mean looking horse with a nose spoofing kind of a guy
Papa always said boy you won't get far
Spending all your pennies at the hillbilly bar
But I'm a cowboy
Yeah I'm a cowboy
I like my snakeskin boots with an alligator tie
And a ten gallon hat with a bottle of rye
Cause I'm a cowboy
Yeah I'm a cowboy
And I got a big bell buckle holding up my pants
And my head don't move during a two step dance
And I'm a mean looking horse hoofing nose spoofing kind of a guy
Yeah I'm a mean looking horse hoofing nose spoofing kind of a guy
Wackenshoe
You're in the rocking chair there, big buddy, tell that.
Yeah, I'm 10-8 in the convoy with a bear in the air.
Doing double nickel.
Catch you on the rebound.
I need a pretty little dilly with a little romance
A little dagger lily and some Levi's pants
Cause I'm a cowboy, yeah I'm a cowboy
And I got an 8 track tape with some D .Y. Yoakam
I got a pack of smokes but I ain't gonna smoke'em
Cause I'm a cowboy
Yeah, I'm a cowboy
And I got a big bell buckle
Holdin' up my pants
And my head don't move
During a two-step dance
And I'm a mean lookin'
Horse-woofin', nose-spoofin' kind of a guy
Yeah, I'm a mean lookin'
Horse-woofin', nose-spoofin', kind of a guy
Wagons, oh
Yeah, I got your wall-to-wall there, big buddy
Channel clear
Yeah I'm a mean lookin' horse with a nose whoopin' kind of a guy
Yeah I'm a mean lookin' horse with a nose whoopin' kind of a guy
