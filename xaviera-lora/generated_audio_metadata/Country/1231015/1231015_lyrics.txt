My old truck Susie had a heart attack
You should have seen the smoke she was blowing out back
So I took out my tools didn't need no help
Don't need triple A I can do it myself
Now poor little Susie is rustling in the old junkyard
Funny how money always seems to drive everything I do
Ends in me spending a dollar for each nickel that I hold onto
Something for nothing ain't worth the trouble that it puts you through
If you're gonna cut corners your pockets better be real deep
Cause cheap ain't cheap
I was driving kinda reckless, I was 65
I saw the flashing red lights and they pulled me aside
So I went to see the judge, tried to plead my case
Who needs a lawyer at those fancy rates?
Now I'm serving 90 days in the Franklin County Jail
Funny how money always seems to drive everything I do
Ends in misspending a dollar for each nickel that I hold on to
Something for nothing ain't worth the trouble that it puts you through
If you're gonna cut corners your pockets better be real deep
Cause cheaper ain't cheap
No it ain't cheap
Take my free advice
Cheap ain't worth the price
Funny how money always seems to drive everything I do
Ends in me spending a dollar for each nickel that I hold on to
Funny how money always seems to drive everything I do
Ends in me spending a dollar for each nickel that I hold on to
Something for nothing
It ain't worth the trouble that it puts you through
If you're gonna cut corners, your pockets better be real deep
cheap ain't cheap
Ha ha ha ha ha
Yeah, and cheap ain't cheap
