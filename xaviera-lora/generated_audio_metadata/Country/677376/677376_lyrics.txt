He doesn't wear leather boots or ride on a horse
He likes to play golf and sing
That's power for the cores
A six shooter's not his bad
A silver star he don't wear
But put on a wailing song
And you can pick him out anywhere
Calypso cowboy
Taking it easy and making love
It's not a prairie he's dreaming of
He'll settle for his place in the sun
Calypso cowboy
He don't wear spurs and don't carry a gun
That's not his idea of having fun
But up his sleeves a trick or two
He doesn't drink whiskey much
He don't drive a Ford
He likes to stay home at night
But he's never bored
He'll tell you a tale or two
He'll spin you a yarn
He don't smoke that funny stuff
But he's got it growing out in the barn
Calypso cowboy
Taking it easy and making love
It's not a prairie he's dreaming of
He'll settle for his place in the sun
Calypso cowboy
He don't wear spurs and don't carry a gun
That's not his idea of having fun
But up his sleeves a trick or two
He doesn't wear leather boots or ride on a horse
He doesn't drink whiskey much
He don't drive a Ford
He'll tell you a tale or two
He'll spin you a yarn
He don't smoke that funny stuff
But he's got it growing out in the bum
Calypso cowboy
Taking it easy and making love
It's not a prairie he's dreaming of
He'll settle for his place in the sun
Calypso cowboy
He don't wear spurs and don't carry a gun
That's not his idea of having fun
But up his sleeves a trick or two
Calypso Cowboy
