The river of tears I cried
Didn't make the waters rise
No flood was keeping you from leaving
Missed down at the scene of the crime
But I know if I am innocent or if I didn't dance
From out of nowhere a storm blew in and there was death in the air
In the crowds they look like ghosts surrounding me
Looking at me like they know it's done
You're scared and alone at the wonder of
But who's to blame? Which one of us? Who has to pay for what's been done?
On and on over death, over love and this heart of mine
Was it murder or suicide?
Will it remain a mystery?
Will I look in the mirror and see who's the really
The one who's guilty?
Like somebody walked across my grave
When I watched you drive away
Well did you want to?
Or did I false you?
Well, it's the middle of July but my heart is cold as ice
And the clouds, they look like ghosts
Surrounding me, looking at me like they know it's time
It's getting low, let the wonder out
But who's to blame? Which one of us? Who has to pay for what's been done?
On the night of the death of a love in this heart and mind
Was it murder or suicide?
And now I'm left to bury a love that died too soon (what we thought it would soon)
Should I hate iveness or beg for iveness from you?
On the night of the death of a love in this heart of mine
Was it murder or suicide?
