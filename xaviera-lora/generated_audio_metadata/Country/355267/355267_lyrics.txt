Ain't nothing you can say
Sometimes you have to start over
You did your best
You didn't go your way
Pack your bags and hit the highway
Just get the heck out of the driveway
Or you can bet your last dollar you'll find another reason to stay
And your days will go on
But you're a soulmate to leave without ya
It's a strange place
You should have your living in
Where the sun don't shine bright
And the dogs howl all night long
Clues all around
Stumbling to something wrong
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm
A face like an angel ain't no guarantee of heaven
A voice so sweet, can't guarantee song
When promise means little, it all comes down to action
Take a little action, cut your losses and run
Don't think about her, it won't be hard to live without her
Another red flag sun, stumbled into something wrong
And the days that go by
Each day will feel better
Only real love hurts, it digs deep and wide
Don't you even feel guilty, afraid about what would be
Life's a little better when a man can keep his pride
Pack your bags and hit the highway
Just get the heck out of the driveway
You feel a lot better when you're finally moving on
Clues, son, you've stumbled into something wrong
