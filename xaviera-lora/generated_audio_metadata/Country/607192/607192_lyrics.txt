He reminds me of a perfect afternoon
A picnic in the country or an old Hank Williams tune
He reminds me of the best that love can do
He reminds me of you
He reminds me of a hot summer night
Underneath the blanket of the pale moonlight
He reminds me of a dream coming true
He reminds me of you
He reminds me I'm a heart without a cause
Since you've been gone I'm less than half of what I was
Every time I hold him close I'm closer to the truth
He reminds me of you
He reminds me of a smoky mountain spring
A freshly fallen snowflake dancing on an eagle's wing
And he reminds me life is beautiful
He reminds me of you
He reminds me
I'm a shadow on the wall
Without you
I'm nothing at all
Even when I call his name
A fool can see right through
He reminds me
He reminds me I'm a heart without a cause
Since you've been gone I'm less than half of what I was
Every time I hold him close I'm closer to the truth
And the truth is he reminds me of you
He reminds me of you
He reminds me of you
