So tired
Wish I could sleep for an hour or so
I'm cold and a little wired
But my truck's stuck here on the side of this road
And there's good folks counting on me
Gotta move this load
That's why I drive my eighteen-wheeler
All across this big old land
Not just my job, more than my living
It's the heart of who I am
Sometimes it's tough but I rise above
And do everything I can
Got my wife and kids back home
And they're proud to know
I'm a US working man
I'm a US working man
So fast
Hard times just blaze right through our lives
But I know these days will pass
Cause we'll all find a way to make things right
It's what keeps this country great
And we don't think twice
That's why I drive my eighteen wheeler
All across this big old land
Not just my job, more than my living
It's the heart of who I am
Sometimes it's tough, but I rise above
And do everything I can
Got my wife and kids back home
And they're proud to know
I'm a US working man
That's why I drive my 18-wheeler
All across this big old land
Not just my job, more than my living
It's the heart of who I am
Sometimes it's tough but I rise above
And do everything I can
Got my wife and kids back home and they're proud to know
I'm a US working man
I'm a US working man
I'm a U .S. working man
