There's nothing like the scent of a woman
First thing in the morning when I rise
Everything in the world I'm looking for
I can find it shining in her eyes
The passion in her voice when she whispers
Every word every man longs to hear
She protects me from harm in the shelter of her arms
As her tender kiss draws me near
She brings me back to my senses
Her beauty reminds me
She's the only love that will ever find me
She brings me back to my senses
She makes all the sense in the world to me now
When she walks into a room, heads start turning
Out of genuine respect for her mystique
I'm overcome with desire like an anxious child
Who sets his sights on something sweet
She laughs away the clouds when it starts raining
And a single tear can drench me to my soul
When she brushes back her hair there's a rainbow hiding there
An overflowing pot of gold
She brings me back to my senses
Her beauty reminds me
She's the only love that will ever find me
She brings me back to my senses
She makes all the sense in the world to me now
She brings me back to my senses
She makes all the sense in the world to me now
She makes all the sense in the world to me now
