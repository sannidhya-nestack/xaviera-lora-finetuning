Well, I do believe it's time
To leave the past behind
And let it go while I still can
Where's the point in holding on
What's done is done and gone
Where's the reason or the rhyme
I do believe it's time
Time to learn to laugh again
To act like I just don't care again
Listen baby
Where's the point in holding on
What's done is done and gone
Where's the reason or the rhyme
I do believe, I do believe it's time
Time to learn to laugh again
To act like I just don't care again
Listen baby
Where's the point in holding on
What's done is done and gone
Take one long last look behind
I do believe, I do believe it's time
Where's the point in holding on
What's done is done and gone
Where's the reason or the rhyme?
I do believe it's time
