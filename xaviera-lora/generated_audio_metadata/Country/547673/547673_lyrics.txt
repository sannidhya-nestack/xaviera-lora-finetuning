And looking at old photographs, pictures of you
Memories of you and me, the smell of your perfume
It seems to me just yesterday you were lying here so sweet
But now these memories just haunt me
I want you here with me
Every time I look into the eyes of Amy
Every time I kiss away
The tears from her eyes
Every night at bedtime
We say a prayer, say a prayer
For all the little girls
Whose mama's looking down from heaven
She is growing up to be so, so beautiful
Auburn hair and hazel eyes, a sweet complexion too
She is doing well in school, straight A's in her class
You would be so proud of her
Making friends at last
Every time I look into the eyes of Amy
Every time I kiss away the tears from her eyes
Every night and bedtime
We'll say a prayer, say a prayer for all the little girls
Whose mama's looking down from heaven
In everything we do
We share the memories of you
And in her eyes I see your soul shining through
Today's the day I take her hand and walk her down the aisle
Into her new life, she's a new wife, you'd love to see her smile
And she looks so beautiful in the same dress that you wore
With a new husband to be
No more daddy's little girl
And every time I look into the eyes of Amy
Every time I kiss away the tears from her eyes
Every night at bedtime we say a prayer
Say a prayer for all the little girls
Whose mama's looking down from heaven
I know you're looking down
Whose mama's looking down
I know you're looking down from heaven
