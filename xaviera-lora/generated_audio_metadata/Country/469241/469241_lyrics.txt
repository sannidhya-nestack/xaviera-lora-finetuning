She can't shake, she can't shake no more
She can't shake, she can't shake no more
I need to find a potion, I need to find a cure
A firefly told me she got poison in her veins
A firefly told me it's driving her insane
Tonight lightning will be striking
Here comes old Coltrane
She can't shake
She can't shake no more
She can't shake
She can't shake no more
I need to find a potion
I need to find a cure
It weighs like a stone
I wish she had a clone
She got the devil inside her
She's in her own zone
She's gone through all
Into the unknown
She can't shake
She can't shake no more
She can't shake
She can't shake no more
I need to find a potion
I need to find a cure
She can't shake
She can't shake no more
She can't shake, she can't shake no more
I need to find a potion, I need to find a cure
She can't shake, she can't shake no more
She can't shake, she can't shake no more
I need to find a potion, I need to find a cure
