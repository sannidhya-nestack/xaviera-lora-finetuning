The evening sun is sinking low
And I'm gazing out
The kitchen window
The radio's tuned to an old E station
And I'm drifting away
On a song they're playing
I see pictures of you and me
And I know as I leap through our memories
It's just a sentimental look back through the old times
When you were mine, when you were mine
It's just a faded scrapbook
Turned to my favorite place
Your smiling face hates on me
A sentimental love
In the front room, late one night
We were dancing by candlelight
The same radio played an old Beatles tune
You said listen to the words, they're from me to you
They were singing about love at last
And I know all too well there's no future in the past
It's just a sentimental look back through the old times
When you were mine, when you were mine
It's just a faded scrapbook
Turned to my favorite place
Your smiling face, hey it's on me
A sentimental hook
Hey it's on me
Sentimental love
This is only sentimental love
