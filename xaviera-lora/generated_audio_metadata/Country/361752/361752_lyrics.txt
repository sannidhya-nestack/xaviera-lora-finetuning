Walk in the neighborhood, got a pounding headache
Thinking about life, been one of those days
When I see kids jumping and the puddles getting wet
And it makes me smile and it makes me et
Yeah, it makes me et
when children laugh, I can't help but stop and smile
All my worries go away for a little while
And when they laugh, I feel good inside again
It's like a call from an old friend
Oh, when children laugh
Feeling better as I move on my way
Going back over how those kids changed my day
Echoes of laughter lift my spirits up
And it makes me think someone should bottle this stuff
Yeah, but all this stuff
when children laugh I can't help but stop and smile
All my worries go away for a little while
And when they laugh I feel good inside again
It's like a call from an old friend
Oh, when children laugh
Oh, when children laugh
When children laugh
'Cause when children laugh, I can't help but stop and smile
All my worries go away for a little while
And when they laugh, I feel good inside again
It's like a call from an old friend
Oh, when children laugh
Oh, when children laugh
Oh, when children laugh
When children laugh
