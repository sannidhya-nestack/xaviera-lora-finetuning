I've had empty pockets
But I just found a ten dollar bill
Gonna buy me a pack of cigarettes and a gallon jug of wine
And tonight I won't feel no park bench chill
Ain't much work for a railroad man these days
Truckers come and took my job away
For thirty-one years I earned my pay
Loading freight on to Santa Fe
I've had empty pockets
I just found a ten dollar bill
Gonna buy me a pack of cigarettes and a gallon jug of wine
And tonight I won't feel no park bench chill, that's right
When I apply, they say that I'm unskilled
When I apply, they say I'm too old
I am a working man living out in the cold
I've had empty pockets
But I just found a ten dollar bill
Gonna buy me a pack of cigarettes and a gallon jug of wine
And tonight I won't feel no park bench chill
I've had empty pockets
