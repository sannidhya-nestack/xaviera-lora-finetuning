I don't know why, I don't know why
I thought I did, but I don't
I just can't see why I'm so blind
I don't know why, I don't know why
I told you time and time again
It's time we both start listening
This time our love will say goodbye
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know who or what
There are no ifs ands or buts
I don't know when or where our love disappeared
I can't find it anywhere
I don't know who or what
There are no ifs ands or buts
I don't know when or where
Our love disappeared
I can't find it anywhere
I don't know why, I don't know why
I thought I did, but I don't
I just can't see why I'm so blind
I don't know why
Lord, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Oh, sweet baby, come inside tonight
