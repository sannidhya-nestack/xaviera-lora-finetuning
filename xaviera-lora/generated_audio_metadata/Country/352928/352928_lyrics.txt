(Crying)
Who let down that tide
Who let you decide
At the dusty end of the road
With your black book by your side
Who played out on you
What slipped and fell on you
Hear the windmills creak and groan
And the lonely soul push through
They used to say that this place was hell
Now another whiplash to call the end
Plays a song you know so well
You got the big sun up there
And everything's tie-dye
Hear the banshee only moans
And the silverback called to fly, fly
Now who the hell are you gonna tell
That the glow behind the truck lights
Is why you sniffed and paled
Now Madeline's gone away
Said she made up her mind
Though she's not leaving today
She'll be gone in the blink of an eye
She'll be gone in the blink of an eye
She'll be gone in the blink of an eye
