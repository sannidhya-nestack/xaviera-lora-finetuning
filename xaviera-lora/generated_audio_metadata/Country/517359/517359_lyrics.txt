I'm on the rise
Of a lifetime
I'm on a ship that's sailing to uncharted shores
And I won't be coming back here anymore
I'm on a wave
I'm on a mountain
I'm on a roller coaster
Sailing across the sky
And the only trouble is in wondering why
I'm on a ride, going nowhere
I am an existential cowboy on the wind
And I won't be coming out, I'm going in
This man's awake
A storm's a-risin'
The dawn's a-waitin'
the hundred monkeys know
And I can feel the light-filled monkeys start to grow
