There's an ocean in the sky
Can you see it?
Where the birds swim when they fly
Would you believe it?
Could you believe it?
There's a highway in your hand
Did you know it?
There's no traffic but a traveling band
Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
Have you noticed where your mind can take you to?
Have you noticed that your heart can lead you to?
Look there are faces on the trees
Have you met them dressed in colored hats of leaves
I'd like to wear one
Would you like to wear one
And there are flowers in your eyes
I can see them and the bees know they're surprised
I'd like to share one
I'd like to share one
Have you noticed where your mind can take you to?
Have you noticed that your heart can lead you to?
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm
There's an ocean in the sky
There's a highway in your hand
There are faces on the trees
There are flowers in your eyes
La la la la la la la
Have you noticed? La la la la la la la
Have you noticed? La la la la la la la
Have you noticed? La la la la la la
Have you noticed? La la la la la la la
Have you noticed?
La la la la la la la
Have you noticed?
