She dreams in colors almost like a second sight
She dreams in colors in the lavender starlight
Rainbows at midnight riding shotgun down moonbeams
She dreams in colors and I'll meet her in my dreams
When they took me into custody they gave me one phone call
So I dialed the radio station and requested a song
I told the DJ at the station about a girl I used to know
And he played this dedication on the radio
She dreams in colours almost like a second sight
She dreams in colours in the lavender starlight
Rainbows at midnight riding shotgun down moonbeams
She dreams in colors and I'll meet her in my dreams
As the fog drifts by the riverside
It starts to move away
I'm reminded what I should have said
To her, but didn't say
There are many things I'll take with me
To my final day
But my heart isn't one of them
That girl has stake to claim
She dreams in colors almost like a second sight
She dreams in colors in the lavender starlight
Rainbows at midnight, rotten shotgun down moonbeams
She dreams in colors and I'll beat her in my dreams
She dreams in colors almost like a second sight
She dreams in colors in the lavender starlight
Rainbows at midnight, rotten shotgun down moonbeams
She dreams in colors and I'll beat her in my dream
She dreams in colors almost like a second sight
She dreams in colors in the lavender starlight
Rainbows at midnight, riding shotgun down moonbeams
She dreams in colors and I'll meet her in my dreams
