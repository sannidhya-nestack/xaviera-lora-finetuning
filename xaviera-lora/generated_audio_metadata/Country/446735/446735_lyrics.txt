I counted up my sins today
It nearly took me all the day
I counted some in twos and threes
Wishing one might set me free
I tried to find my dreams today
But they could not be found
I tried to breathe new life today
No oxygen was found
My life has changed so many ways
New sins replace the old
I'm stuck inside an endless trance
Two parts penance one loss of soul
Two parts penance one loss of soul
Whose sins are these I do not know
I found them on my walk today
Whose dreams are these I couldn't say
I want some as we talk today
I counted up my sins today
And washed them in the sand
Scrubbed them carefully on the rocks
Washed each one by hand
My life has changed so many ways
New sins replace the old
I'm stuck inside an endless trance
Two parts penance one loss of soul
Two parts penance one loss of soul
The magnet draws you close to me
Gravitational allure
You seem, you scream, you dance all night
You must have found the cure
What seemed okay wiped down the pain
What drowned your sorrows fast
Abruptly fell into the sea
With such a mighty crash
My life has changed so many ways
New sins replace the old
I'm stuck inside an endless trance
Two parts penance one loss of soul
Two parts penance one loss of soul
