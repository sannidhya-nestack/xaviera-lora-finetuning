You owe me love song,'cause I wrote one for you
I know it isn't fancy and it don't say nothing new
But at least you know that every word I sing it is true
Hey, you owe me love song,'cause I wrote one for you
You bought me a car but it fell apart
A good song won't do that you see
I can write one for you
And play it for anyone
And still get to keep it for me
So I'll buy you no candy
Don't bring me no wine
Let's just pass that ephemera by
Yeah, just pull down your mandolin, make like a bird
And give me three minutes thirty on why
You're gonna love me forever the way I'd love you
Collaborators in life
And we'll always be singing these love songs together
we'll always be husband and wife
You wrote me a love song
You wrote me a song about how tough you are
You wrote me a string quartet
You wrote me an abstract, poetical song
Most of which I didn't get
So I'm writing this song to say how much I love you
Might take a lifetime to sing
So don't wait for me, darling, write me a love song
One that tells me the following things
You're gonna love me forever the way I love you
Collaborators in life
And we'll always be singing these love songs together
we'll always be husband and wife
Hey, you owe me a love song
'Cause I wrote one for you
I know it isn't fancy
And it'll say nothing new
But at least you know that every word I'm singing it is true
Hey, you owe me love song
'Cause I wrote one for you
