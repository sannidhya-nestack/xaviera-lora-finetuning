Won't you sit down and talk with me
Don't tell me that you're gonna leave
I know you were meant for me
My green-eyed girl
Come and walk along and hold my hand
Let me know that you understand
Come on baby let me be your man
My green-eyed girl
You and I must finally make a pact
Can my aching heart bring you back
If you say that your love is true
And you'll never make me blue
I'll always love you one and only
My green-eyed girl
You and I must finally make a pact
Can my aching heart bring you back?
If you say that your love is true
And you'll never make me blue
I'll always love you and only you, my green-eyed girl
