Love came knocking on my door
Like it's never done before
God knows I should have let it in
Instead of asking where it'd been
And as I watched it turn away
I heard a voice inside me say
Sure this might happen now and then
But it may never come again
So love, don't lie
I wanna believe again but don't make me cry
Should I jump off the fence or leave my heart with no defense
Or shut the door not even having tried
Now love, don't lie
Love don't lie
And so I chased love down the lane
Gave it just one more chance again
Gonna throw my hat into the ring
And let tomorrow bring what it will bring
But love don't lie
I wanna believe again so don't make me cry
When I jump off the fence and leave my heart with no defense
Down the line will I be wondering why
Now love don't lie
But love don't lie
I wanna believe again so don't make me cry
When I jump off the fence and leave my heart with no defense
Down the line will I be wondering why
Now love don't lie
Love don't lie
Love don't lie
