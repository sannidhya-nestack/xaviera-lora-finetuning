I've been in exile in Washington D .C.
Can't remember why I went there, I can't remember why I left my home
This whole town seems inverted, they got walls, they got walls, they got walls
We got soft, baby, we got caught, yeah, we got lost
And I went woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We got soft, baby, we got caught, yeah, we got robbed
And I went woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'm a filthy alcoholic (yeah)
Keep your daughter away from me
I get pumped once I get started
End up with blood all in my teeth
Oh we got soft baby we got caught yeah we got robbed
And I went woah oh oh oh oh
Oh we got soft baby we got caught yeah we got lost
And I went woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
We should mess around, you know, don't kiss me in the mouth
You wanna stare, don't be afraid
I won't mess you up, you know, kick you in the gut
You wanna win, I need you here
We can run around, you know, go play along the ground
I got you up, don't be afraid
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
