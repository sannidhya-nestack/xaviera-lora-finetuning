All those stories of misleading glory
Might have talked tale to tale
Just to cushion the blows
Suffered from a tight heart
Oh, it was failing from the start
How much can you spare to part
When you're traveling alone?
He was tired and disgusting
He was pushed beyond control
He took his life to free his dying soul
Washed up memories of tragedy and comedy
A roller coaster of life never quite finding home
Never cared about himself just him and no one else
Couldn't take the weight it felt so he pulled himself down
He was tired and disgusting
He was pushed beyond control
You can't blame Billy Bradford
He took his life for his dying soul
All his tears cried never seen on the outside
They all poured behind his eyes back into his pride
May seem a little strange he put an end to his pain
Said goodbye momma way and he called it a day
He was tired and disgusted
He was pushed beyond control
Can't blame Billy Bradford
He took his life to free his dying soul
He took his life to free his dying soul
