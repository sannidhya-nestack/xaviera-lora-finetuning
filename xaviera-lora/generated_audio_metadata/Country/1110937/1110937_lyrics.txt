You say you wanna see your name in lights
A star in the heavens on a Hollywood night
Walk the red carpet, tease the paparazzi's lens
Or maybe the first woman president
Sign a new law with the stroke of your pen
Build a bridge to the nations, bring hunger to an end
Dream, baby, dream
Dream with abandon and an open heart
The faith of a child praying in the dark
Don't settle for less than everything you can be
Dream
Bitter hearts will line up to tell you you can't
Just stretch out your arm, raise the palm of your hand
Their words of doubt can steal your destiny
Dream, baby, dream (dream, baby, dream)
Dream with abandon and an open heart
The faith of a child praying in the dark
Don't settle for less than everything you can be, dream
Paint your name across the sky with strokes of crimson red
And promise me wherever life leads until you breathe your last breath
You'll dream
Dream, baby, dream
Dream with the passion of a loving heart
The faith of a child praying in the dark
Don't settle for less than everything you can be
Dream
