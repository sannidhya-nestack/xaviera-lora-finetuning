You asked me to help find your lawyer
So I drove you downtown in the rain
I even helped you pack your belongings
And though it hurt me, I eased your pain
Don't bother asking
Take everything
And don't et to take your wedding ring
Right now you don't know
But soon enough you'll see
I'm not doing this for you
I'm doing this for me
For what goes around comes around
And what goes up always comes down
I'm setting myself up for another perfect love
What goes around comes around
I signed the papers, I know you're happy
The house is sold, the dog is yours
And that's alright with me
There's no more loose ends, I can't hold on to
And though you left me, I'll always love you
I can't stop giving you
All I've been giving you
Just because you've given up on us
Right now you don't know
But soon enough you'll see
I'm not doing this for you
I'm doing this for me
For what goes around comes around
And what goes up always comes down
I'm setting myself up for another perfect love
What goes around comes around
I'm setting myself up
Another perfect love
What goes around
What goes around
Comes around
