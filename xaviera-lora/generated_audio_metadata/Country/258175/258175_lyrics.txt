Funny bumping into you
There are less painful things to do
But since we have, I guess I'll say
I've been alright, just not today
And I do rely upon the memory of your love
The way you made me feel with just one touch
And though you're gone and have moved on
The wreckage still remains
But I'm alright, yeah I'm okay
You look good, better yet
Just like the day that we first met
And oh it's good to see your smile
Haven't seen that for quite a while
And I know it's hard for you to see me when I cry
Standing here so close after that goodbye
And you don't have to say a thing
In fact, please don't
I'll be alright, I guess I'll go home
And oh it's good to see your smile, yes it is
Haven't seen that for quite a while
And I know it's hard for you to see me when I cry
Standing there so close
After that goodbye
And you don't have to say a thing
In fact please don't
I'll be alright, I guess I'll go
I'll be alright, I guess I'll go
Funny bumping into you
