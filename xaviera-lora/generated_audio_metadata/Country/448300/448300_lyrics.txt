Ever since I was a young boy I heard my daddy say
Keep the golden rule and walk the straight and narrow way
We've tried our very best to raise your rights so do us proud
Don't lie or cheat or run the street at night with the wrong crowd
Well, I tried to make'em happy
I went to church and stayed in school
Did my best to show'em that they didn't raise no fool
Then Daddy passed away one day and Mama lost her mind
And I rode my thumb to Memphis without a single dime
I walked those city streets cold and hungry to the core
And out of desperation I held up that liquor store
But I didn't plan to shoot a man who died there at the scene
And that put me on the pathway to cell block seventeen
Now it's a place where big men break and those who don't soon will
Where the nights are pierced with cries and moans and the days of death are still
Where men can find billows and tiny smiles are seldom seen
For men like me contend to die on cell block seventeen
For nine long years I've sat here in this cell for what I've done
To await the day to finally say my date with death has come
Now I've seen some men take their last walk with their heads held high
While others laugh, scream, fight or beg with terror in their eyes
Now the warden stands beside me, and as the chaplain says a prayer
My life flashes before me as they strap me in this chair
God let my tragic ending prevent those after me
To live a life which leads to death on cell block seventeen
Now it's a place where big men break and those that don't soon will
Where the nights are pierced with cries and moans and the days of death are still
Where men can find billows and time and smiles are seldom seen
For men like me condemned to die on cell block seventeen
Beyond the grey forbidding walls, a cell block seventeen
