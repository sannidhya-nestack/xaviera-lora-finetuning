I don't want to think about tomorrow
Things that might be on my worried mind
I tell myself sometimes not to hurry
Cause I know that things are gonna work out fine
I don't wanna go to San Francisco
Though I can't deny it's fine from what I've seen
Or watch the sun go down in New York City
When it's just another place that I ain't been
Tell me what should I do
Can't get used to me losing you
Looks like you ain't going my way
But it's okay
I don't want to think about tomorrow
Or things that might be on my worried mind
I tell myself sometimes not to hurry
I know that things are gonna work out fine
Tell me what should I do
Can't get used to me losing you
Looks like you ain't going my way
But it's okay
I don't wanna go to San Francisco
If you make me, I'll fly home
And I don't wanna go to New York City
If you make me, I'll fly home
