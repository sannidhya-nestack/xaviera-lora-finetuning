It's five o'clock when he gets up to face the day
Hungover from the night before
Born and raised a family man in every way
She kisses him as he walks out the door
He's a titan, shines his love throughout the land
Side of that he'll do the best he can
He's a lover, child of figure, he's a hired hand
A late spirit for the working man
He plunges in as he begins his working day
Takes his place on that assembly line
He breaks the sweat and breaks the gap
That racing time
There's so much weighing on his mind
Things are tight and times are tough throughout the land
But beside that he'll do the best he can
He's a lover, father figure, he's a hired hand
They cheer it for the working man
He's tired as the siren ends his working day
Joins the boys and has another beer
He heads back home to hug the kids
And thanks his wife
For his little piece of paradise
He's hiding tons of stuff throughout the land
By that he'll do the best he can
He's a lover by the figure, he's a hired hand
Let's do it for the working man
Let's do it for the working man
