I start to miss her the moment I walk out the door
I drive for a living gone for days sometimes more
But the way I get through it each time that I go
Is pretend it's the back end of the trip coming home so I'm happy
I'm halfway to her love every minute I'm gone
Always on my way home no matter what road I'm on
Might be pulling a day trip or a thousand mile drive
But I'm halfway to her love at least in my mind
We fell in love when we first met
It's a good life we share
I can smile while I'm gone
I know that she's there
And her dad drove a truck
So she understands me
Now each time I go
I'm coming home as I leave
So I'm halfway to her love
Every minute I'm gone
Always on my way home, no matter what road I'm on
Might be pulling a day trip or a thousand mile drive
But I'm halfway to her love, at least in my mind
A trucker's life can get lonely, but it don't bother me
I know she's waiting back home and that's all that I need
Got a picture of her on the dash for good luck
And halfway to her love is the name of my truck
So I'm halfway to her love every minute I'm gone
Always on my way home no matter what road I'm on
Might be pulling a day trip or a thousand mile drive
But I'm halfway to her love
Oh, I'm halfway to her love
At least in my mind
At least in my mind
