Do your lies work on you like they work on me?
When is the truth gonna finally set us free?
This love has been so rough as if I'm riding on the wind
Is this so long to you and me?
If you really love me then make me believe it
If you're gonna love me then take it or leave it
I'm leaving
If you say you want me then I gotta see it
And if you really love me then make me believe it, believe this
Every time I draw a line with all of my energy
It was always innocent and now I should wait with everything
I'm really getting tired of wasting my time and losing my sanity
This is so long to you and me
If you really love me then make me believe it
If you're gonna love me then take it or leave it, I'm leaving
If you say you want me then I gotta see it
If you're gonna love me then make me believe it, believe this
Last chance you give with me
It might be the last kiss you give to me
Am I still here?'Cause there's nowhere else to go
In the end, I just need some kind of peace
Can I just have a little bit of peace?
If you really love me then make me believe it
If you're gonna love me then take it or leave it, I'll leave it
If you say you want me then I gotta see it
If you're gonna love me then make me believe it, believe this
If you say you love me then make me believe it, oh
If you really love me then take it or leave it, I'm leaving
If you say you want me then I gotta see it
And if you're gonna love me then make me believe it, believe it
