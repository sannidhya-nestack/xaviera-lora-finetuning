I was just a freckle faced boy at ten
With an old cane pole and a stringer of brim
It was just dad, his little man and him
Against the one that got away
When his hard days work at the plant was through
He always found time just to toss a few
Smelling mama's fried chicken it was our cue
And it raised me all the way
What I'd give if only somehow I could just go back in time
And walk that old dirt road and feel the wind rush through the pines
That'll always be a part of me there that I left behind
But every now and then I still go back and I find my country state of mind
We'd gather up to supper both Saturday nights
A-pickin' and a-singin'neath the front porch light
Daddy do Elvis to Mama's delight
Then we'd all sing Amazing Grace
Now the years have flown by and I've full grown
I've got a beautiful wife and a boy of my own
This big city living will never be home
I hear the country calling me
What I'd give if only somehow I could just go back in time
And riding that side walk pony down at Woolworth's five and dime
There'll always be a part of me there that I left behind
But every now and then I still go back and I find
My country state of mind
My country state of mind
My country, state of mind
