Take a risk, take a risk, take a risk
Just give me a kiss
And your sweet love
You like to jump from a plane
Surfing hurricanes
Ghost storm chasing after tornadoes
Push the limit again and again
So when it comes down to love
What are you scared of?
Well take a chance on me and maybe then you'll see
My love's another thrill and you can't get enough
Take a risk, take a risk, take a risk
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
Take a risk, don't try to resist
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
We can take it real slow
Or any speed that you wanna go
I can get your spine to tinglin'
Give you goosebumps high and low
But don't think me uncouth
I've got'couth for two
So baby trust in me and I'll guarantee
I'll be your heart pounding soul stirring through buckaroo
Take a risk, take a risk, take a risk
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
Take a risk don't try to resist
Just give me a kiss
And your sweet love is all I need
While we live life on the edge
Honey, you can always depend on me
I will be here endlessly
Take my hand and let's step out on the ledge
Take a risk, take a risk, take a risk
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
Take a risk, don't try to resist
Just give me a kiss
Take a risk, take a risk, take a risk
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
Take a risk, don't try to resist
Just give me a kiss and your sweet love
