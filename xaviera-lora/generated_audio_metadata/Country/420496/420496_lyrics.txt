This is my resume of love
Never had a chance, at least in my head
My strings include loneliness, dinner for one and a single bed
This is my resume of love
My resume of love
I kissed a girl once, maybe'cause I was a little drunk
And never got that close again, so I write love songs for no one
Talk to myself, and in my bed by ten, in my bed by ten
Just my resume of love, seared into my memory
it's pretty short, I got one cup and a single key
Just my resume of love, my resume of love
It seems a little unfair
This whole thing called love
Being alone is a lie to bear
A lone toothbrush in its holder
And only my side of the bed
Only one side of the bed
This is my resume of love
Never had a chance, at least in my head
My strings include loneliness, dinner for one and a single bed
This is my resume of love
My resume of love
Can't be the only one who lost his smile
Can't be the only one to hear the silence
To find love I'd run ten thousand miles
Got a big, big heart that one day will fit into someone's small hands
Someone's small hands
Just my resume of love
Seared into my memory
it's pretty short
I got one cup and a single key
Just my resume of love
My resume of love
This is my resume of love
Never had a chance, at least in my head
My strings include loneliness, dinner for one and a single bed
This is my resume of love
My resume of love
