Young G .C. barely a man when he left for the open sea
What else for a boy from Tennessee
He packed his life in the back of a bus
And his dad said listen to me
Here's a note your mom and I want you to read
It said one day you will find a home
With a girl or on your own
From this day you'll never be alone
Young JC kicking his heels saying there's gotta be more to life
One day I'ma find myself a wife
She's gonna have long blonde hair
And a name like Rosalie
Seems like just the type I'm gonna need
She'll make me feel like I'm at home
Never leave me on my own
Rosalie, go make yourself known
Young JC, phone is for you, said it's from the military
Boy it's time you go back out to sea (back to sea)
He made his way to the big Humvee
And never did he think that he
Be the young JC to go to sea (go to sea)
They stood in pairs and made it seem
Like they were born to be a team
But young JC was trembling at the knees
One late night in'44
In the middle of a naval war
Be the last young JC ever saw (ever saw)
That cellogram flew through the door
And his mother fell to her knees
Along with a letter signed by young JC (young JC)
Said mom if you could see me now
You and dad would be so proud
I love you and I can't wait to come home
I love you and I can't wait to come home
