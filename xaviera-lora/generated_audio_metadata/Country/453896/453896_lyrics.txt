Oh, my daddy always told me
When you love someone
You gotta give'em what they want
Even if it's their freedom
This thing that you wish for
Is really killing me
I hope it makes you happy
I hope it sets you free
Now I'm rolling into Tucson
Been driving all night long
The farther these wheels take me
But more things feel so wrong
Still I know I'm doing right
The best thing that I could
I'm a thousand miles closer
To starting to feel good
You didn't know I heard you saying how I cramped your style
Complaining to your mama and crying all the while
First I said to myself was that you talking all the boos
Until I finally realized it sounded like the truth
Now I'm rolling into Tucson, been driving all night long
The farther these wheels take me, the more things feel so wrong
Still I know I'm doing right, the best thing that I could
I'm a thousand miles closer to starting to feel good
I'm not sure if leavin's right
But I'm so far past let's see
When dawn shines through my windshield
I don't know where I'll be
Now I'm rollin' into Tucson
Been drivin' all night long
The farther these wheels take me
The more things feel so wrong
Still I know I'm doing right
The best thing that I could
I'm a thousand miles closer
To starting to feel good
I'm a thousand miles closer
To starting to feel good
Yeah
Starting to feel good
