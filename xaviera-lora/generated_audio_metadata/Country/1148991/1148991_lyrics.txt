Got a ticket in my pocket
Man says all aboard the nine o'clock train
Fill the engine moving faster
In the direction, destination
Where it don't rain, oh
I'm a woman, don't mistake me for a pushover
I don't take orders, soldier
I can't fight all your losing battles
Can't wrestle the weight of your world on my shoulders
You can call me a quitter, a loser, deserter, yeah I'll stand down
You don't have to say sorry, be angry, leave me, I'll back out, I'll back out
Let'em say what they want about me
It is what it is
But I know what it ain't
If you take in a wolf and you feed it
It doesn't make him any more intense
You can call me a quitter, a loser, deserter, yeah, I'll stand down
You don't have to say sorry, be angry, leave me, I'll back out, I'll back out
Quietly with dignity'cause part of the problem was me
You can call me a quitter, a loser, deserter, yeah, I'll stand down
You don't have to say sorry, be angry, leave me, I'll back out, I'll back out
You don't have to say sorry, be angry, leave me, I'll back out
I'll back out, I'll back out, I'll back out
