If you would have asked me
If you only took the time
If you would have asked me
For what's precious and what's mine
I'd have given freely
What is only mine to give
But you wear the mask of a thief
You never asked
Somebody told me
Or what you intended and how you sold me
Conveniently pretended, could not believe it
Was it you that I defended?
You wear the mask of a thief you never arrest
It only hurts to talk about it
Your heart is so untrue
I used to see wild horses
Thundering toward the sun
Now I see you
If you would have asked me
Discarded the disguise
Could have found a passkey
Passed the place in you that lies
Could have found safe passage
Through the wide blue open skies
But you wear the mask of a thief
You never rest
Sweet talkin' voice, you know I'd hear it
Set my spirit running free
Now I've made my choice and you can't get near it
You best steer clear of it
And I don't want to talk about it
there's nothing you can say or do
I used to see wild horses
Thundering toward the sun
Now I see you
Now I see you
Now I see you
