(audience laughing)
We all waved when the train rolled through
It seemed an able thing to do
The engineer he waved right back
Before disappearing down the track
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
But our penny's on the rail
When we heard that lonesome whistle wail
We'd pick'em up all shiny and flat
Amazed the train could do all that
A &WP, you're just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
A &WP, you're just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
The trestle's stood since 1910
That train won't cross it here again
The depot's now a new café
That tries to save that long lost day
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
A and WP are just a memory
Rolling through my mind of the days I've left behind
