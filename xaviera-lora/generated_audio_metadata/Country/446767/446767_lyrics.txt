I'm climbing up this mountain, I'm ing across this stream
I'm walking forty miles, I'm living for this dream
I'm baking in the hot sun, I'm dusty and I'm dry
I'll make it there by Sunday
And you're the reason why
I know there's gold in Memphis
It's on my radio
It wakes me in the morning
And soothes my heart just so
It's made a star of many
From Marty to Elvis
I gotta get me some
Girl down in Memphis
I wrote these songs all down
I played them for my girl
She said head down to Memphis
Get yourself a record deal
We'll build ourselves a home
We'll fill it full of kids
Just sing them what you sang me
Just show them what you did
I know there's gold in Memphis
It's on my radio
It wakes me in the morning
And soothes my heart just so
It's made a star of many, from Marty to Elvis
I gotta get me some, girl down in Memphis
I seen these guys all done it, just drummin' singin' songs
Don't look hard to me
Be rich before too long
I know there's gold in Memphis
It's on my radio
It wakes me in the morning
And soothes my heart just so
It's made a star of many
From Marty to Elvis
I gotta get this on
Go down in Memphis
Go down in Memphis
