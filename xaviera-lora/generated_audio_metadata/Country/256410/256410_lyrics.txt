I saw you standing there and my heart stood still
You looked at me, oh I got that old familiar thrill
The look in your eyes told me, oh that you knew
That I had been looking for someone exactly just like you
Hey baby, what you got goin' tonight
Hey baby, you could make everything oh so right
Hey baby, what you got goin' tonight
Who knows baby, maybe tonight's the night
Do you see me here? Here I am, I'm looking at you
Oh, do you hear me talking? Here I am, I'm talking to you
I wonder, is this a dream? Everything seems to be oh so right
Now we're dancing and we're danced and your arms are holding me tight
Hey baby, what you got goin' tonight?
Hey baby, you could make everything oh so right
Hey baby, what you got goin' tonight?
Hey baby, maybe tonight's the night
Hey baby, you could make everything oh so right
Hey baby, watcha got goin' tonight
Who knows baby, maybe tonight's the night
