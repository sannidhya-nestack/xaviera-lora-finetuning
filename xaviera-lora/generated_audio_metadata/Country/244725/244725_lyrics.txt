Done for the week
As I punch out one more time
My back to this place
Oh, a hell in no man's land
Needin' me at two-four
For all us boys in the band
It's time for a party
Oh, time to hit the stage
I dust off my best dirty cowboy hat
The boys ready to rock this place to the core
And as the crowd swells onto the dance floor
I hear a one voice roar that says
Play some country
But don't play anything at all
Play some country
But don't play anything at all
A bit of a change up
We boys tinted like a rock
Good to have a backup
We start with Willie and Waylon
Move to traditional tones
Last count I think it was ten
We're hitting on notes
Line dancers doing their thing
As I take off my vest, dirty cowboy hat
And all the people lining up at the door
And as the crowd keeps filling onto the dance floor
I hear one voice roar that says
Play some country
But don't play anything at all
Play some country
But don't play anything at all
We're playing steady
As we churn out the classics tune after tune
Something catches my eye
As a few beer bottles fly by
Some good old boys in a dust up
Gotta be a full blue moon
But with the fun and the dancing
No one really cares
And dust off my best dirty cowboy hat
The boys ready to rock this place to the core
And as the crowd swells onto the dance floor
I hear a one voice roar that says
Play some country
Or don't play anything at all
Play some country
Or don't play anything at all
As I put back on my best dirty cowboy hat
The people still lining up outside the door
And as the crowd keeps fellin' onto the dance floor
I hear one voice roar that says
Play some country or don't play anything at all
Play some country or don't play anything at all
