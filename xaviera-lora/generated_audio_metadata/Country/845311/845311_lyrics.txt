Oh, the loneliest sound that I ever heard was I
Don't love you anymore
And the saddest sight
That I've ever seen
Was you walking out the door
The coldest tears
That I ever cried
Girl, you put them in my eyes
You changed my life for better or worse
And you didn't even try
You took a love that was made in heaven
And you tore it all apart
God help me and bless your heart
all you left me with was wine
You changed my life for better or worse
And you didn't even try
You left me alone
Before you walked out
But I feel you still live in this home
The place where we built our whole life upon
Is now just a house of wood and stone
Even if the sun don't rise and the moon don't shine
I'll love you'til I die
You changed my life for better or worse
And you didn't even try
You took a love that was made in heaven
And you tore it all apart
God help me and bless your heart
all you left me with was why
You changed my life
For better or worse and you didn't even try
You changed my life for better or worse and you didn't even try
You didn't even try
