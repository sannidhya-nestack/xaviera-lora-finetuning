Mansions, money, diamonds and gold
There's nothing in this world you can keep or hold
Now having fine things is really great
But it won't get you into the pearly gates
Mansions, money, diamonds and gold
Won't mean much when you're growing older
You can sit around and wonder why
But not one minute will your money buy
Here's a story we all know
You can't take it with you when you go
All you're taking with you is your soul
Here's a story we all know
You can't take it with you when you go
All you're taking with you is your soul
Mansions, money, diamonds and gold
Won't mean much when you're growing old
You can sit around and wonder why
But not one minute will your money buy
Here's a story we all know
You can't take it with you when you go
All you're taking with you is your soul
Here's a story we all know
You can't take it with you when you go
all you're taking with you is your soul
Mansions, money, diamonds and gold
There's nothing in this world you can keep or hold
Now having fine things is really great
But I won't get you into the pearly gates
