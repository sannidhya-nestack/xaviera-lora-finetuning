She walks me across Texas and answered my dreams
She thrilled me and romanced me in the hills of Tennessee
And one day in Virginia I knew I was in love
And just one Alabama night with her was not enough
Carolina mornings with her made love come alive
And once I got to G ia I couldn't keep her off my mind
Just like so many others
I'm under her spell
And this song is dedicated to the Queen of the Southern Bells
She's the reverse
She's the mountains
She's the soft wind through the pines
She's the beauty
She's the magic and the charm
Her majesty sweet Dixie is deep down in my heart
I have gazed with wonder into her crystal clear blue skies
I've lost myself somewhere between her sunsets and her nights
Oh how she stirs my senses and satisfies my soul
No matter where I wander she's the only home I'll know
She's the rivers
She's the mountains
She's the song
The wind through the pines
She's the beauty
She's the magic and the charm
Her majesty sweet Dixie
Is deep down in my heart
She's the rivers
She's the mountains
She's the soft wind through the pines
She's the beauty, she's the magic and the charm
Her majesty sweet Dixie is deep down in my heart
