My sweat pouring down on the side of the river bank
Drinking tall boys catching small mouths just one of those summer days
Heard something rushing through the trees
Turn around lord what do I see
Blue eyes, blonde hair, Daisy Dukes and her baby teeth
I saw the mess I must confess this girl was blessed
Hots of the mess, letting down her hair, getting undressed
Hots of the mess, I'm losing breath, pounding in my chest
Yeah, I don't think she noticed I was there
Didn't even see the barber shaking on my hand
This catfish gonna have to wait
She's taking her sweet old time
Stars and stripes bikini
Dipping her toes in the water mud
She jumps in with the warm G ia wind
And I'm falling in love
Hot southern mess
I must confess
This girl is blessed
Hot southern mess
Letting down her hair
Getting undressed
Heart's a mess, I'm losing breath, pounding in my chest
Yeah, I don't think she noticed I was there, I was there
She whips her hair and looks around
I hit the deck hoping I didn't make a sound
Pick my head up slowly and I see
She's winking back at me
She's winking back at me
Hot Southern mess, I must confess
This girl was blessed
Hot Southern mess, letting down her hair, getting undressed
Hot Southern mess, I'm losing breath, burning in my chest
Yeah, I know that she noticed I was there
And I know that she saw me over there
And she winked when she let that top go bare
