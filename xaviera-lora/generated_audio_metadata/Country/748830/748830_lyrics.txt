We've been riding night and day just to get to the Grand Ole Opry
We just stopped for gas, I know we ain't stopping for any smokies
Keeping those tires turning down, there's a sound check at 7 .30
We're just nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the Opry
We're just nine miles away
But it took so long to get this far
The second coming of Floyd Kramer is on the piano
And the band leader's got the notion
That he is Billy Monroe
Y'all come out and see us
we put on a real good show
We're just nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the Opry
Nine miles from the out break
We're just nine miles away
But it took so long to get this far
We're two steps a thousand one night stands
Now we're playing in the promised land
We come from South Dakota and worked our way across Missouri
We played up and down the state, did a weekend in Jefferson City
Last night we played in Memphis, now we're bound for Nashville, Tennessee
We're just nine miles from the off break
Nine miles from the outbreak
Nine miles from the outbreak
Nine miles from the outbreak
We're just nine miles away
But it took so long to get this far
We're just nine miles away
But it took so long to get this far
