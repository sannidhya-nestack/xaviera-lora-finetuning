Think of the power, the will and desire
Think of the courage, eyes filled with fire
Remember the story, the team and the glory
Thrill of the victory
Captain oh captain
Soul of a city
Captain oh captain
Getting down and gritty
Captain oh captain
Showing them the direction
Captain oh captain
Got the heart of a champion
Think of the leader
Men win in tradition
Ooh, think of the winner
Strength of conviction
Remember the story, the game and the glory
Thrill of the victory
Captain oh captain, soul of a city
Captain oh captain, getting down and gritty
Captain oh captain, showing them the direction
Captain oh captain got the heart of a champion
Well, captain, oh captain, soul of a city
Captain, oh captain, getting down and gritty
Captain, oh captain, showing'em the direction
Captain, oh captain, got the heart of a champion
Heart of a champion
Yeah, you got the heart of a champion, baby
Whoo, I think of the power
I think of the courage
Yeah, you got the heart of a champion
