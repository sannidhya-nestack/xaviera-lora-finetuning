Oh my father who art in heaven
Tried to hallow your name since seven
Your nun's rulers cracked my hands
Turned my faith to the badlands
Oh my lordy way up there in heaven
I ain't been chasing your kingdom come
Especially with some things I've done
Please I said bring no temptation
But these prayers fail with great sensation
Oh my lordy way up there in heaven
As you look down from your throne above
Could you please send me some extra love
Trying to be the best that I can be
There's so much down here tempting me
I ive all who have harmed me
But the same's not been done to me
And I ask you deliver me from evil
But my life's full of nasty upheaval
Oh my lordy I'm way up there in heaven
I'm sure you got the power and the glory
But that's not the whole gosh darn story
For Satan still is worshipped here
Especially after we drink too much beer
Oh my lordy, way up there in heaven
As you look down from your throne above
Could you please send me some extra love
Trying to be the best that I can be
There's so much down here tempting me
Yeah
Make it
Amen
Although I get my daily bread
Some of us starve each day instead
Oh Lord, your prayer's a holy one
Thy will be done, thy will be done
Oh my lordy, way up there in
Oh my lordy, way up there
Oh my lordy, way up there in heaven
