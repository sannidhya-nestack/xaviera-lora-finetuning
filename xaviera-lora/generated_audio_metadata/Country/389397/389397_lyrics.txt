Now it's time to turn out the light
Close your sleepy eyes
Goodnight forest
Now it's time to say goodnight
And sing soft lullabies
Good night, forest
Good night, sleep tight
Wake up bright in the morning light
Good night, sleep tight
You know everything is alright
Every day must come to an end
The moon and stars must rise
Goodnight forest
Tomorrow we'll have lots of fun
Beneath the sunny skies
Good night forest
Good night sleep tight
Wake up bright in the morning light
Good night sleep tight
You know everything is alright
You know everything is alright
