I'll be your rock, I'll be your safe place
I'll hold you tight, I'll be your home base
I will be here when you need a place to land
I'll be your harbor, I'll be your man
I'll be your rock, I'll be your safe place
I'll hold you tight, I'll be your home base
I will be here when you need a place to lie
I'll be your harbor, I'll be your man
We couldn't be more different, you and me
I'm always here but I never know where you'll be
Maybe our opposites attract, yeah
'Cause I'm in love with you and that's a fact
I'll be your rock, I'll be your safe place
I'll hold you tight, I'll be your home base
I will be here when you need a place to lie
I'll be your harbor, I'll be your man
You live life fast, I'll live it slow
You're a flight risk, I'm steady as she goes
I may be stuck in the mud but you can depend on me
I may be just what you need
I'll be your rock, I'll be your safe place
I'll hold you tight, I'll be your home base
I will be here when you need a place to land
I'll be your harbor, I'll be your man
I know what I want
I know what's in my heart
I want you in my life
And I'm trying to do my part
I'll be your rock
I'll be your safe place
I'll hold you tight, I'll be your home base
I will be here when you need a place to land
I'll be your harbor, I'll be your man
