That jukebox ain't seen a quarter since 1999
Torn up booth in the corner, names carved in the side
Faded neon flicker, flip it off about three AM
But the liquor keeps on flowing'til the sun comes up again
This is my dime, and I'ma gonna dive in
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop, whoop whoop, this is my die
That table's missing an eight ball but no one seems to mind
Full of my kind of people'cause great minds drink alike
Dark inside on sunny days
But Christmas lights up year round
Friday night lights make it empty
But it sure ain't empty now
This is my dive
And I'm a gonna dive in
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
It's my time
Everybody in it for the deep end
Tearin' up that old dance floor
Half the hour goin' on weekends
To pour another two, three, four
Keep my tab rolling, rolling
Keep the taps flowing, flowing
Nobody going home yet, no
Keep my tab rolling, rolling
Keep the taps flowing, flowing
Nobody going home yet
Everybody hit it for the deep end
Tearing up that old dance floor
Happy hour going on weekends
So pour another two, three, four
This is my dime
And I'ma gonna dive in
