All the day I was born I let out a rebel cry
Merle Haggard records were my favorite lullabies
Before I walked I two stepped on my mama's knee
I'm corn fed purebred standing tall as I can get
Red white and true country
I grew up a country mile
Down a country road
My daddy, daddy, daddy
Was a country to the bone
Great grandpa planted bluegrass
the family tree
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take country out of me
My kind of heavy metal is a pedal steel guitar
A violin turns into a fiddle when it's played from the heart
The songs that rock my cradle ain't on MTV
I'm no thanks Jimmy Hagger you can take it to the bank
Red white and true country
I grew up a country mile down a country road
My daddy's daddy's daddy was a country to the bone
Great grandpa planted bluegrass'round the family tree
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take country out of me
My kind of heavy metal is a pedal steel guitar
A violin turns into a fiddle when it's played from the heart
But the songs that rock my cradle ain't on MTV
I'm no thanks Jimmy Hacker you can take it to the bank
Corn fed, pure bread, standing tall as I can get
Homegrown dirt road, say it everywhere I go
Fed white and true country
