You've never kept anything from me
But tonight is a good time to start
I don't wanna hear what's on your mind
If it's gonna break my heart
Keep it to yourself
Don't wanna hear your reason
Keep it to yourself
I'll go on believin'
Keep it to yourself
Baby if you're leavin'
Keep it to yourself
Let me find out later than sooner
Right now I don't want you to go
You can tell everyone but don't tell me
I wanna be the last to know
Keep it to yourself
Don't wanna hear your reason
Keep it to yourself
I'll go on believin'
Keep it to yourself
Baby if you're leavin'
Keep it to yourself
What's playing at the movies?
Do you think it's gonna rain? (think it's gonna rain)
Whisper something good to me
Baby, any bad news can wait
Keep it to yourself, don't wanna hear your reason
Keep it to yourself, I'll go on believin'
Keep it to yourself, baby if you're leavin'
Keep it to yourself, oh
Keep it to yourself, don't wanna hear your reason
Keep it to yourself, I'll go on believin'
Keep it to yourself, baby if you're leavin'
Keep it to yourself, don't wanna hear your reason
Baby if you're leavin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
