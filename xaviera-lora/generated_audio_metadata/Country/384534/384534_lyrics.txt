How can I, how can I go on
Being the only, being the lonely one
You went away, leaving me afraid to live
You were the one keeping me so warm
Leading me through life's trials and tribulations
Now I'm alone feeling like a
And there's a hole in my heart
And I don't know where I start or end
And I don't know who to be
And the future's hard to see
And I don't know where to turn to
so much of me
Was you
I'm crying inside and there's no place to hide
All of these memories keep flooding the gates of my mind
I need to be strong, I need to get on with my life
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize
All that I'd lost when you took your love from me
I didn't know how hard letting you go would
And there's a hole in my heart
And I don't know where I start or end
And I don't know who to be
And the future's hard to see
And I don't know where to turn to
so much of me
And I don't know who I am
Now that you don't give a damn for who I was
Like a singer with no song
I don't know where I belong
I'm lost and alone without your love
And there's a hole in my heart
And I don't know where I start or end
And I don't know who to be
And the future's hard to see
And I don't know where to turn to
so much of me was you
