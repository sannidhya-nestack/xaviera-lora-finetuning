Who cares if friends can't figure out
What our love is all about
Some wonder what I see in you
And why I love you like I do
It's the way you keep our love fire burning
And never let that flame go out
Lover I got no doubts
Feel the fire
Let it burn
With love when it gets hot it's no concern
Don't slow down
Till it's out of control
If there's too much heat I'll let you know
And as the flames keep growing higher and higher
Just feel the fire
Sometimes I hear some people say
We're as different as night and day
They don't see when the lights get turned down low
The raging fire that starts to grow
it's the way you keep our love fire burning
And never let that flame go out
That's what it's all about
Feel the fire
Let it burn
With love when it gets hot it's no concern
Don't slow down
it's out of control
If there's too much heat I'll let you know
And as the flames keep growing higher and higher
Just feel the fire
It's easy to keep this fire burning
It's pure love melting with desire
Soaking the flames with our hearts yearning
Building the passion even higher
Feel the fire, let it burn
With love when it gets hot it's no concern
Don't slow down, feel it's out of control
If there's too much heat, I'll let you know
And as the flames keep growing higher and higher
Just feel the fire
Oh yeah, oh oh
Feel the fire, let it go, yeah yeah
If there's too much heat I'll let you know
