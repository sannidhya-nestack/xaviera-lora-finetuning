Here's a story about Banjo Bill
And his best friend Fiddle Fred
Together they played in the streets at night
Thrilled the people and brought delight
Together they played in the streets at night
Brought sunshine when there was raining
A stranger he came along one day
And with his mandolin he started to play
Stunned the crowd with his speed and might
And left the boys way out of sight
Stunned the crowd with his speed and might
Silenced Bill and Fred
Benjamin and Fiddle Fred were stunned by what the strangers said
Benjamin and Fiddle Fred, see how they play
Benjamin and Fiddle Fred were stunned by what the strangers said
Benjamin and Fiddle Fred, see how they played
Banjo Bill and Fiddle Fred were stunned by what the stranger said
Banjo Bill and Fiddle Fred, see how they play
Banjo Bill and Fiddle Fred were stunned what the stranger said
Banjo Bill and Fiddle Fred, see how they play
That stranger he stood back in awe
As the crowd shouted out for more
That fiddle it screamed as the banjo played mean
And the crowd shouted encore
That fiddle it screamed as the banjo played mean
And the crowd it shouted out for more
That fiddle it screamed as the banjo played mean
And the crowd shouted encore
That fiddle it screamed as the banjo played mean and the crowd
It shouted out for more
Shouted for more
Banjo Bill and Fiddle Fred
Please shout it for more
