Maybe it's the way your smile lights up the room
Every time you walk in the door
And maybe it's the way I feel when you're in my arms
That keeps me coming back for more
I've taken a shine to you
I've got a new point of view
You're the one I want to love my whole life through
I've taken a shine to you
I'm looking to rendezvous
Will you be mine, give me a sign
I've taken a shine to you
Even though I know I've got my feet on the ground
I feel like I'm walking on air
And even though I know I've got my head in the clouds
One thing is perfectly clear
I've taken a shine to you
I've got a new point of view
You're the one I want to love my whole life through
I've taken a shine to you
I'm looking to rendezvous
Will you be mine, give me a sign
I've taken a shine to you
I don't know just how you got your tender chains on me
All I know is I don't ever want to be set free
I've taken a shine to you, I've got a new point of view
You're the one I want to love my whole life through
I've taken a shine to you
I'm looking to rendezvous
Will you be mine
Give me a sign
I've taken a shine to you
Will you be mine
Give me a sign
I've taken a shine to you
