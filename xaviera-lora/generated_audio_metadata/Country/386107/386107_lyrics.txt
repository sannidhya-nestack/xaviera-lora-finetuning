The last time it happened before we entered the war
Was the year 1940, Brian Hextall had scored
But for the Stanley Cup, Rangers no cup anymore
'Til the curse would be lifted in the year'94
Messier, Kovalova, Lover and Leech
Skated like angels with wings on their feet
Always believing in the end they would be
Stanley Cup champions in the city of dreams
The curse of Red Dutton lasted fifty-four years
Years of frustration, heartache and tears
But with all of the losing, with all the bad luck
We stood by our Rangers, no we never gave up
Gray's chicken and Zuboff and Metto faced the test
Richter and Healy stood tall in the nets
Nemtchino, Bukabung pounded and deked
Dunin, Wells and McTavish made them harder to beat
Coach Iron Mike Keenan and the'94 team
Made a run for the cup in the City of Dreams
And the aisles went down in four straight
The caps hung in longer, five and out was their fate
But the devils nearly made the dream die
Took some heart and some magic to keep it alive
The boys from Vancouver were fast and were mean
With Momesso and Bourré, a real fighting machine
When it came to Game 7 it was winner take all
A short step to glory or a long way to fall (He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a)
Messier, Carvel of a Lumber and a Leech
Skated like angels with wings on their feet
The building was shaking still spirit was seen
Kicked in the ghost from the garden in the city of dreams
Now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city of dreams
Let's go Rangers! He-Ho! He-Ho! Let's go Rangers!
Oh, let's go (let's go)
Come on, Rangers (bring it down)
Now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city of dreams (we've been, let's go) (let's go)
Come on, Rangers (now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city of dreams)
We've got a fighting machine (let's go) (bring it down)
Now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city of dreams
We are champions now! Now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city, our breeze! (Let's go! Rain or shine!)
Now the Stanley Cup's shining in our city, our breeze! (Let's go! Rain or shine! Rain or shine!)
