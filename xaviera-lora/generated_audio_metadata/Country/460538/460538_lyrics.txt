Making quite an entrance
The man all turned to stare
Poured into a tight dress
Believe me she's aware of how we seem
Oh, a little mischief
Look what don't you handle
Dream your hopeless dreams
She don't care about your longings
She'll ruin your self esteem
Your heart she'll squeeze
Oh, little miss teens
To her it's just a game
To see how many hearts that she can take
Hey, hey
And though they know she's poison
They hope to be the one that she will break
They're on their knees
For a little mis-tease
Lips inviting pleasure
And hitting at desire
Manipulating weak souls
Fanning burning fires ignoring the breeze
Oh little Miss Hades
Though she's hot as Hades
Her heart is frost and ice
A touch could snap our fingers
She comes with a surprise, they'll catch the freeze
Oh, little mischievous
To her it's just a game
To see how many hearts that she can take, hey
And though they know she's poison
They hope to be the one that she will break
They're on their knees
Oh, little misties
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Little misties
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Little misties
To her it's just a game
To see how many hearts that she can take, hey
And though they know she's poison
They hope to be the one that she will break
They're on their knees, oh little Miss T
Oh, I don't miss tears
Oh, I don't miss tears
