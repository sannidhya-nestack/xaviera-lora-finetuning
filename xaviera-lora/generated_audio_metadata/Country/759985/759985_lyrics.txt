That pretty smile, long dark hair, and oh those deep blue eyes
That worn out old photograph still melts me deep inside
Wish I knew then what I know now
How a love can turn so cold
Sometimes old memories are better left alone
Old memories are like slow freight trains rolling through the dark
They'll wake you from a peaceful dream and re-break your heart
et the past, move away from the tracks
And try to go on
Old memories are better left alone
Wine continues to improve with each passing year
Classic songs from days long gone stay sweet to the ear
Life is all about holding on and learning to let go
And sometimes old memories are better left alone
Old memories are like slow freight trains
Rolling through the dark
They'll wake you from a peaceful dream
And re-break your heart
et the past
Move away from the tracks
And try to go on
Old memories are better left alone
So I'll put a match to her photograph
Watch her ghost go up in smoke
Old memories are better left alone
