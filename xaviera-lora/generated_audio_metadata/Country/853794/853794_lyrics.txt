I remember when we was in third grade
You would tease me, I would pull on your brakes
I would ride you home on the back of my bike
Cause we knew then what we know now
No changing our minds, no how
We were meant for each other from the very start, yeah
And all I ever wanted to do
Was just spend the rest of my life alone with you
And every time I kiss your lips
It gives me a feeling like I'm calling on glue
And all I ever wanted to do
Was just spend the rest of my life alone with you
Joined the army, fought in Afghanistan
Got wounded, captured by the Taliban
Those old boys were never gonna keep me from you
Cause I knew then what I know now
No going back or turning around
We were meant for each other from the very start, yeah
And all I ever wanted to do
Was just spend the rest of my life alone with you
And every time I kiss your lips
It gives me a feeling like I'm coming unglued
And all I ever wanted to do
Is just spend the rest of my life alone with you
Yeah
And all I ever wanted to do
Is just spend the rest of my life alone with you
Yeah alone with you
Oh, alone with you
