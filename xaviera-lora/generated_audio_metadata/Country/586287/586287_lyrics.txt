But you sexy little devil
Does heaven know you're out tonight?
When you walked into the room
I knew I'd seen the light
You're delicious, delectable, totally irresistible
Manhood, it's so good, boy I wish I could
Your ears must be burning, I've been talking about you all night
Your feet must be hurting
You keep walking through my mind
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Or do I need to walk by you one more time?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Your cool attitude
It's making my blood run hot
If you're pouring out your heart
Baby I'll take a double shot
Just one taste, a tingle
Baby let's mingle
Slow dance, romance
Maybe there's a chance
Your ears must be burning
I've been talking about you all night
Your feet must be hurting
You keep walking through my mind
You believe in love at first sight
Or do I need to walk by you just one more time
You believe in love at first sight
You believe in magic, you believe in faith
You believe you'll know it when the time is right
You believe in love, you believe in love
You believe in love at first sight
