No, I'm not gonna pick up the phone
I won't dial your number to see if you're at home, no, no
When destiny calls, you'll answer alone
No, I'm not gonna pick up the phone
I'm messed up as a mule kicking back in a Cadillac
I'm a lonesome whippoorwill, crying in the night
If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's the day I gave you my love
And the day you did not give me your love back
No, I'm not gonna pick up the phone
I won't dial your number to see if you're at home
When destiny calls, you'll answer alone
No, I'm not gonna pick up the phone
It's not easy to stay in touch when you're so far away
It's easier to run away than it is to stay in touch
Now I wonder why we shared so much
Before our love was not enough
The answer makes it easier to say
No I'm not gonna pick up the phone
I won't dial your number
To see if you're at home
When destiny calls, you'll answer alone
Why not go to pick up the phone
When our love comes down to the wire
No, I'm not gonna pick up the phone
I won't dial your number
To see if you're at home
When destiny calls
You'll answer alone
No, I'm not gonna pick up
Well, I'm not gonna pick up
No, I'm not gonna pick up the telephone
