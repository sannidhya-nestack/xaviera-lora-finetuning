Are you crazy?
You can't let him get the best of you
He's a damn fool
He broke your heart and that ain't cool
So go show off that new tattoo
Sip on some high-heeled shoes
A short red dress that says we're through
Make him punch a hole in the wall
Get on his knees and crawl
Drown himself in alcohol
Let's make this goodbye look so easy
Put him out like a cigarette smoking
Stab that door that you left wide open
Gotta burn that bridge so he's left choking on you
Oh, show him who's leaving who
You're gonna see him
Out with the same old friends
So you've gotta show him
Just what he's gonna miss
Walk up to his ex best friend and take him by the hand
Lean a little too far and break his pride with every
Smile it like a little child
See what he can touch this time it'll drive him crazy
Yeah, goodbye baby
Put him out like a cigarette smoking
Slam that door that you left wide open
Gotta burn that fridge so he's left choking on you
Oh, show him who's leaving
Put him out like a cigarette
Slam that door that you left wide open
Gotta burn that bridge so he's left choking
Put him out like a cigarette smoking
Slam that door that you left wide open
Gotta burn that bridge so he's left choking
On to you, show him who's leaving
Oh show him who's the leader and who
