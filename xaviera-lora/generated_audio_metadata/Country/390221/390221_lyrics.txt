I'm all alone just the other day
Mama said, "Boy, are you okay?"
I locked the door and hid the key
Making sure that you won't find me
I'm looking through her magazine collection
Her eyes always seem to look in my direction
I'll meet you in the ladies room
Just not yet baby not so soon
I can't explain why you're my best friend
That's why I see you over and over again
I'm looking through her magazine collection
Her eyes always seem to look in my direction
The pages stick together with love and affection
You always were my teenage obsession
I'm looking through her magazine collection
Her eyes always seem to look in my direction
The pages stick together with love and affection
You always were my teenage obsession
I'm looking through her magazine collection
Her eyes always seem to look in my direction
The pages stick together with love and affection
You always were my teenage obsession
