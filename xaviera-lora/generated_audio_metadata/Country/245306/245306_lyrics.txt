How long must I wait to hear that still voice?
Must I sit and wonder, is this the right choice?
'Cause everywhere I read that you were faithful and true
every time I listen I hear you screaming through
This isn't a Jew and not about me
But together you make history
without you I know I'd surely fade away
And isn't it you who promises me
In your hands I can trustfully put my life
And you make history
I say I love you, but do I believe?
You say I can't move mountains but this week I need help of my knees
Cause everywhere I read there to be faithful and true
Gotta give it all away, that means trust in you
Isn't it true, not about me, but together you make history
Without you, I know we'll surely fade away
And isn't it true, the promise is me, in your hands I can trustfully put my life
Help me believe some situations it's a capital mean
Instead of trusting you Lord like I say it should be
Help me to lose my life Lord but save my soul (Save my soul)
So when I get to heaven and I call you'll know me
'Cause isn't it true, you're not about me
But together you make history
Without you, I know it'd surely fade away
Isn't it true, you're not about me
But together you make history
Without you, I know it'd surely fade away
And isn't it true, the promise is me
In your hands I can trust fully
Make history, make history
