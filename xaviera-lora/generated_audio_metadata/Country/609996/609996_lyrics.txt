If I can get the words out of my mouth
I'll be happy to tell you all about it
But I can't think, I can't speak
I can only feel what I mean
And I mean what I feel and I've been meaning
To give you everything tonight
With every ounce of strength
With all of my might
I can hold on to you
Till your inside screams
And I know in my heart
You can feel what I mean
Words can't express perfect moments like this
When there's passion and love in your eyes
Let me kiss you all over and over again
Let me show you I've chosen to touch you and then
I've been meaning to give you everything tonight
With every ounce of strength with all of my might
I can hold on to you till your insides scream
And I know in my heart you can feel what I mean
I can't explain it, I know we just met
But I mean what I'm feeling, can you feel what I mean
And I know in my heart you can feel what I mean
If I can get the words out of my mouth
I'll be happy to tell you all about it
And I can't think, I can't speak
I can only feel what I mean
And I mean what I'm feeling
I've been meaning to give you everything tonight
With every ounce of strength, with all of my might
I can hold on to you'til you're inside
And I know in my heart you can feel what I mean
I know in my heart you can feel what I mean
Yes I know in my heart you can feel what I me
