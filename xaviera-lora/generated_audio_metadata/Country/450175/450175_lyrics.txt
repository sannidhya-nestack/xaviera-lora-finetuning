I never made the American Idol
Or so you think you can dance
And I was hoping to get on a reality show
Where you'd give me a second chance
Saw your tears when you left me
You say you didn't see mine
So I got myself a spot on that new game show
Now you can see me live
On So You Think You Can Cry
So you think you can cry, cry, cry
So you think you can cry, cry, cry
I'm gonna show you that I, I, I
I'm the saddest alive
If this is really goodbye, bye, bye
They're gonna give me first prize
I hope you're watching tonight
So you think you can cry
Debbie lost her poodle
She's ballin' and fallin' apart
Joey lost his winning powerball ticket
Lost it in his ex-wife's car
But they can't hold a candle
To weeping like I do
Nobody here's gonna stand a chance
They never lost somebody like you
So you think you can cry
So you think you can cry, cry, cry
So you think you can cry
I'm gonna show you that I, I, I
I'm the saddest alive
If this is really goodbye, bye, bye
They're gonna give me first prize
I hope you're watching tonight
And so you think you can cry
You believe you're hurting more than me
Well girl, I'll take that bet
Sit right down in that easy chair
You ain't seen nothing yet
So you think you can cry, cry, cry
So you think you can cry
I'm gonna show you that I, I, I
I'm the saddest alive
If this is really goodbye, bye, bye
They're gonna give me first prize
I hope you're watching tonight
So you think you can cry (so you think you can cry)
So you think you can cry (so you think you can cry)
I hope you're watching tonight
So you think you can cry
Poor me
