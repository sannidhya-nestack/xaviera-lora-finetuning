His head hung low, horse moving slow
Nowhere to go, he's been away too long
Her love he takes, the morning breaks
Now her heart aches, she's all alone again
So he rides on from dusk till dawn
His hope is gone where will he sleep tonight?
The days slip past
Good times don't last
And dreams fade fast
When you're a drifting man
When you're a drifting man
