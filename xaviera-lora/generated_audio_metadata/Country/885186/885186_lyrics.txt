Can't hold on for very long
You and I, we've got to be strong
There's an old gospel song says we're not here long
Born unto this world, then we're gone
Don't look back, let's et the past
Promise this time we'll try and make it last
I love you now and that's all that matters
If it don't stop raining we just might shatter
The rain it keeps coming down
Need the clouds to break before I drown
Let's hold on and try to make it right
You know the rain's coming down hard tonight
Can't hold on for very long
You and I, we've got to be strong
There's an old gospel song says we're not here long
Born unto this world, then we're gone
The rain it keeps coming down
I need the clouds to break before I drown
Let's hold on and try to make it right
You know the rain's coming down hard tonight
You know the rain's coming down hard tonight
