And nothing against you but I'm hoping that'll change
Come a little closer and tell me your name
Lay down your best hand and I'll call your bluff
What are you doing for the rest of your love?
Whatever you're doing it's doing me good
You got me going I knew you would
You're driving me crazy, so keep it up
What are you doing for the rest of your love?
Turn on your love light, kiss me long and soft
Leave it to nature to take its course
Together forever will never be enough
What are you doing for the rest of your love
Whatever you're doing is doing me good
You got me going, I knew you would
You're driving me crazy, so keep it up
And what are you doing for the rest of your life?
Whatever you're doing to me, do it till we fall down
Whatever you're doing to me, please don't stop now
Turn on your love light and kiss me long and soft
Leave it to nature to take its course
Together forever will never be enough
What are you doing for the rest of your love?
What are you doing for the rest of your love
What are you doing for the rest of your love
What are you doing for the rest of your love?
Ooh, what are you doing?
Ooh, what are you doing for the rest of your love?
