It's late, I know
But I still don't want you to go
I've got this feeling inside of me
You may not think that it's right
But I feel like holding you tight
I just thought that you ought to know
That girl you're driving me wild
Why don't you stay for the night?
What's that you say?
Did I hear you feel the same way?
You say you've had this feeling for some time
Well I can say after tonight
That I believe in love at first sight
It's something I'll remember every day
Still girl you're driving me wild
Why don't you stay for the night
Stay for the night
Will it be long before I see you again? (How long?)
You've given new meaning to my life
You say that you understand exactly how I feel
This feeling's coming over us together, together
It's late, I know
But I still don't want you to go
I've got desire burning inside of me
Don't wanna leave it alone
it just keeps growing and growing
Why don't you stay the night girl and set it free
'Cause girl you're driving me wild
Why don't you stay for the night?
Ooh
Won't you stay for the night?
Come on stay for the night
Yeah stay for the night
I wanna feel your arms around me
Stay for the night
I want your lovin', baby
Stay for the night
I wanna feel your love surround me
Stay for the night
I've got a crazy burning desire
Stay for the night
Woo-hoo-hoo
