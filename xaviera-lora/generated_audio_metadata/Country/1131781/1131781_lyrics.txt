You turn to me when you need someone to listen
all the things your life's been missing
The more we share, the harder it is to see
That I want you to start loving me
That I want you to start loving me
I've been loving you, it's been easy to see
But how will I know when you start loving me?
How will I know what will you do?
How will you show me that you love me too?
That you love me too?
I've been loving you, it seems all my life
And all I ever wanted was for things to feel right
The closer we become, the harder it is to see
That I want you, to start loving me
That I want you
To start loving me
I've been loving you, it's been easy to see
And how will I know when you start loving me
How will I know what will you do
How will you show me that you love me too
Will you take me in your arms
And love me all night long
Will you call me on the phone
And tell me you're all alone
Will you write me a letter
Or ring your heart out in words
Or will you whisper in my ear
The sweetest things I've ever heard
I've been loving you
It's been easy to see
But how will I know
When you start loving me
How will I know what will you do
How will you show me
That you love me too
That you love me too
