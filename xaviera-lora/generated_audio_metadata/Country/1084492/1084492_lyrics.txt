Like a leaf is meant to fall from a tree
Honey you were meant to fall for me
How could love I thought was tried and true
Leave a heart so broken and blue
Now I'm breaking in a new heart
Making a brand new start
If you see me crying in the dark
There's no reason for you to be alarmed
I'm just breaking in a new heart
Cause the one I gave to you fell apart
Someday someone will rekindle the spark
But'til then I'm breaking in a new heart
Honey, I'm afraid our time is up
Forever wasn't meant for us
Someday we'll both look back and laugh
But for now I've gotta face up to the fact
That I'm breaking in a new heart
Making a brand new start
If you see me crying in the dark
There's no reason for you to be alarmed
I'm just breaking in a new heart
Cause the one I gave to you fell apart
Someday someone will rekindle the spark
But'til then I'm breaking in a new heart
Someday someone will rekindle the spark
But'til then I'm breaking in a new heart
then I'm breaking in a new heart
