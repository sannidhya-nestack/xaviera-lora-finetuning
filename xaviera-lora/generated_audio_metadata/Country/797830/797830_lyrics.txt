I'm not an expert on the wines of France
And I don't know a lot about true romance
When it comes to heartache and misery
Living on lies and tragedy
Deep depression with a capital D
Capital D, capital D, capital D
Well I'm the Mississippi Valley Authority, yeah
Mississippi Valley Authority, yeah
There's not much to tell when it comes to love
I never really fell, I just kinda got shoved
But when it comes to bad luck and broken dreams
And so many wasted opportunities
I wrote the book with a capital B
Capital B
Capital B
Capital B
Cause I'm the Mississippi Valley Authority yeah
(M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I)
The Mississippi Valley Authority yeah
