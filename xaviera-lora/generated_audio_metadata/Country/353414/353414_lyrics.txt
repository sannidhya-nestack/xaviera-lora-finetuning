The last waltz of the evening is here
The end of the evening is near
So don't sit or stand, come and waltz with the band
The last waltz of the evening is here
Take me away, won't you take me away
Won't you waltz me away across this floor
I know what these two arms are for
Is holding you
Rhythm and rhyme in three quarter time
Just what I'm looking for
No one else is here on the floor but you and me
The last pulse of the evening is here
The end of the evening is near
Sitting waltz with the band
Last waltz of the evening is here
When we're dancing like this
Yes it feels like a kiss
And we're waltzing like people in love
I know what you've been dreaming of
Is waltzing with me
The last waltz of the evening is here
The end of the evening is near
So don't sit or stand, come and waltz with the band
The last waltz of the evening is here
The last waltz of the evening is here
The end of the evening is near
So don't sit or stand, come and waltz with the band
The last waltz of the evening is here
