That's one, come on baby, I know you're at home
That's two, come on darling, answer the phone
That's three, you can let it ring, I'm in for the long haul
I said I didn't need you
Well I need you after all
After all these years
After all this time
After all these memories
I can't leave behind
I walked away
And promised I'd never call
But I can't live without you after all, after all
That's four, all these butterflies just won't fly away
That's five, they'll make me et what I rehearsed to say
That's it, it won't matter if you don't let down your wall
Yeah I said I didn't want you, well I want you after all
After all these years, after all this time
After all these memories running through my mind
I walked away and promised I'd never call
But I can't live without you after all, after all
Come on let's make a bet
It's a move you won't regret
I will give you nothin' less than forever after all
After all these years
After all this time
After all these memories running through my mind
I walked away and promised I'd never call
But I can't live without you after all, after all
After all
