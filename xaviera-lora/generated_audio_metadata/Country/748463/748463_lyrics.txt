I said, "Hey, hey, hey, whoo! She's my backwoods girl !"
She was born in the backwoods where the law is you get shot
They say you died of natural causes
Her mom delivered her on a log cabin bed
By the time she was nine she already had a rep
For hunting, fishing and making moonshine
Wildberry didn't fall too far from the vine
She's a backwoods girl, hey hey
The dollied part meets many pearl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my backwoods girl
I said, "Hey, hey, hey, whoo! She's my backwoods girl"
She's so beautiful when she's singing her tune
I swear even God stops what he's doing
To listen to the music with the tub-thumping beat
I never heard anything half as sweet
And speaking of sweet, taste your rhubarb pie
I know you'll want to stay the rest of your life
We're the Backwoods Girl, hey
A dolly pardon meets Minnie Pearl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my Backwoods Girl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my Backwoods Girl
If you get lost looking for a hillbilly heaven
You can always stop and ask a bear for directions
To a backwoods girl, hey hey
A dolly parton meets Minnie Pearl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my backwoods girl
She's a backwoods girl, hey hey
The dolly part meets Minnie Pearl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my backwoods girl
She will rip you a brave new world
She's my backwoods girl
I said, "Hey, hey, hey, whoo, she's my backwoods girl"
I said, "Hey, hey, hey, whoo, she's my backwoods girl"
