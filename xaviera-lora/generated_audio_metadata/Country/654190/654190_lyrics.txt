Look at those wheat fields whistling by
My red tail lights flashing through the night
And I know, I know I'm gonna miss you
But never mind all that, never mind all that
Let me say, I wish you well
I can still see your blue eyes shine
I'll carry you with me down the miles
And may this world never treat you unkind
And having said all that, having said all that, let me say
I wish you well
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
May this world never treat you unkind
Having said all that, having said all that
Let me say, I wish you well
Having said all that, having said all that
Let me say
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
