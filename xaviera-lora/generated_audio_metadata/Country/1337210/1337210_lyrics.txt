I don't know how this came to be
Try by fire we could not foresee
If it's hurting you it's hurting me
What happens to you happens to me
Whatever comes whatever you do
I want you to know
I'm here for you
Our dreams were big and they came true
I became me because of you
Come what may my aim is true
It happens to me if it happens to you
Whatever comes
Whatever you do
I'm with you all the way
I'm here for you
Every dark cloud hides the light
Pain and trouble shows your real might
A little gloom doesn't portend doom
Things'll be alright
I still love you with all my might
If it's hurting you it's hurting me
What happens to you happens to me
Whatever comes
Whatever you do
I want you to know
I'm here for you
Our dreams were big and they came true
I became me because of you
I'm here for you
