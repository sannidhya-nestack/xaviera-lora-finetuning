You're still crying
But you won't tell me what's the matter
You're still hurting
But you won't let me kiss it better
Can't look in my eyes when you say goodbye
You're really trying to keep your distance
Every day I'm lost in a crazy fight
But I'm prepared for your resistance
Every night you're broken
Heart is looking in the wrong direction
You see what's impossible but I see what you need
I will love you, though you don't wanna hear me sayin'
I will love you, whatever way you wanna play it
Turn me down, throw me out
Nothing's gonna make a difference
Even if I'm wrong for you right now
I will love you round
You don't know it but you have got a guardian angel
Always watching and here to lift you up keep you safe from danger
Every night your broken heart's been looking in the wrong direction
Standing right in front of you was all you'd ever need
I will love you, though you don't wanna hear me sayin'
I will love you whatever way you wanna play it
Turn me down, throw me out
Nothing's gonna make a difference
Even if I'm wrong for you right now
I will love you well
Let me be like the spring into the winter
Setting free hearts that nearly freeze
I will love you though you don't wanna hear me sayin'
I will love you whatever way you wanna play and turn me down
Throw me out
Nothing's gonna make a difference
Even if I'm wrong for you right now
I will love you round
You don't wanna be in the way
And the way you wanna play it
You can't stop me now (You can't stop me now)
I'm gonna love ya (I will love you)
