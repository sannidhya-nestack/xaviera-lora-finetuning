Papa told me when I was young
There's no such thing as a boogie man
But when I'm out there on that dance floor
Lord, that's just exactly what I am
That really is a boogie man
I come out late at night, I don't need a full moon
When I got that neon light
Well, I haunt this honky-tonk as often as I can
And when the band begins to boogie, I become the boogie man
Well I ain't scary and I ain't mean
Just the dancin'est fool you've ever seen
Don't be afraid to let the good times roll
Well I came in here to dance, so let's get out there and go
There really is a boogie man, I come out late at night
I don't need a full moon when I got that neon light
Well, I harp as honky-tonk as often as I can
And when the band begins to boogie, I become the boogie man
Baby, feel the back beat bangin' in the back of your head
You shoulda listened to your mama, yeah, you oughta be home in bed
We both knew from the moment that I met ya
I was gonna get ya, I was gonna get ya
Boogie man gonna get ya, out on the dance floor
There really is a boogie man, I come out late at night
I don't need a full moon when I got that neon light
I haunt this honky-tonk as often as I can
And when the band begins to boogie, I become the boogie man
Oh, you just can't keep from shaking when you're with the boogie man
Make me feel the backbeat bangin' in the back of your head
