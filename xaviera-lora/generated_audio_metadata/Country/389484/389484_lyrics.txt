Bobby and Sissy were lovers
And oh how they could kiss
He'd say, "Come here little woman
And let me show you this"
You see and he's believing
And knowing's another thing
Then they knew what they were doing and what the love would bring
Go on, go on and love all lovers take a chance
Love is the kind of song that gets your feet to dance
You don't have to move you can say it with a glance
Twirling in baby's arms and do a lover's dance
Bobby and Sissy got married, how the years flew
There were babies and dirty dishes and mortgage overdue
Birthdays, graduations, weddings before the new
They were rocking in their rocking chairs
Holding hands under the moon
Go on, go on and love all lovers take a chance
Love is the kind of song that gets your feet to dance
You don't have to move you can say it with a glance
Twirl it in baby's arms and do a lover's dance
When you feel that touch out on the floor
You wanna have that dance forever more
And I won't go on and love all lovers take a chance
Twirling in baby's arms and do a lover's dance
And do a lover's dance
And do a lover's dance
And do a lover's dance
