Waking up to just an ordinary day
Nothing strange about it
Nothing standing in my way
And I walked in and saw the writing on the wall
I can't believe I never dreamed how far I'd fall
And I don't know where I'd go from here
Twisted up, tied in knots
Who are you? I think you ot
Cause you let me down, oh you let me down
Up in smoke, down the drain
Have your fun as we go up in flames
Cause you let me down
Oh, you let me down
You let me down
The starting over brings me right back to the end
And every time it falls apart
It's back to where we began
You can't lift me up
Cause you're the one who brought me down
And I won't say a word, and I won't make a sound
And I don't know where I go from here
Twisted up, tied in knots
Who are you? I think you ot
you let me down
Oh, you let me down
Up in smoke, down the drain
Have your fun as we go up in flames
you let me down
Oh, you let me down
You let me down
You let me down
Twisted up, tied in knots
Who are you, a thank you for God
Cause you let me down, oh you let me down
Up in smoke, down the drain
Have your fun as we go up in flames
Cause you let me down, oh
Oh, you let me down
I'm twisted up, tied in knots
Who are you? I think you ot
you let me down
Oh, you let me down
Up in smoke, down the drain
Have your fun as we go up in flames
Cause you let me down, oh you let me down
