We met at AJ's Good Time Bar
Your white Chevy pickup license plate guitar
I was digging it all from the start
That Calgary stampede cattleman hat smile
Secret, you had me at hello
Wantin' on ya ain't no sin
Don't know if I'm ready to jump right in
I'm workin' with a fragile heart
Am I really ready for a new start?
But if I come knockin' on ya
Knock, knock, knock, knock (just let me in)
Baby let me in
You see I ain't some needy little girl
And I've been on the dance floor for a twirl
This lady's looking for a whole lot more
And you check a lot of them boxes for sure
Wanting on you ain't no sin
Don't know if I'm ready to jump right in
I'm working with a fragile heart
Am I really ready for a new start?
But if I come knocking on your
Just let me in, baby let me in
I think I've made up my mind
I think that this is the time
I wanna travel on your road
And see where it goes
Wanting on you ain't no sin
Don't know if I'm ready to jump right in
I'm working with a fragile heart
Am I really ready for a new start?
But if I come knocking on your
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah (Just let me in)
Better let me in, yeah (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na-na)
Let me in (Na-na-na-na-na, na na-na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
