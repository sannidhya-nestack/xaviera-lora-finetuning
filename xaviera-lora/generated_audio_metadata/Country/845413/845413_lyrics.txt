I ain't playin' with a full deck
My head's not screwed on tight
I've lost most of my marbles
And I'm not in my right mind
There's a few loose shingles on my roof
And I'm one brick shy of a load
Honey, you're drivin' me crazy
And we just ran out of rope
You're driving me crazy baby
Crazy over what you do to me
You're driving me crazy baby
Ain't no maybe
You're in the driver seat
They can't lock me in a padded cell, this boy's gone looney tunes
I can't stop talking to myself and I'm barking at the moon
I don't quite know which end is up, I feel downright insane
I'm on track for the funny farm, and baby you're the train
You're driving me crazy baby
Crazy over what you do to me
You're driving me crazy baby
Ain't no maybe
You're in the driver seat
You're driving me crazy baby
Crazy over what you do to me
You're driving me crazy, baby, ain't no maybe
You're in the driver's seat
Boy, you're driving me crazy, baby
You're driving me crazy, baby
You're driving me crazy, baby
I don't want no shortcuts baby
Let's take the long scenic tour
You're driving me crazy baby
But I'm sure enjoying the ride
You're driving me crazy baby
You're driving me crazy
