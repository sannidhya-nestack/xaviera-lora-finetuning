I'm wearing mama's wedding dress today
Walking down the aisle with daddy
He's gonna give me away
I love you honey that's a fact
And I know there's no turning back
Like a frozen winter bursting into spring
No turning back
Like a rising sun that shines on everything
No turning back on our love I know as of today
No turning back no way
I knew it from the day our eyes first met
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it
And when I kissed your lips, oh yeah
That's when I said
This train is running down the track
Full speed ahead
No turning back
Like shooting star that streaks across the sky
No turning back
Just like fireworks exploding in July
No turning back on our love I know as of today
No turning back, no way
Falling in love was such an easy thing with you
And I can hardly wait'til we say I do
No turning back
Like the Mississippi flowing to the sea
No turning back
Ain't it funny how some things were meant to be
No turning back on our love forever and a day
No turning back, no turning back, no turning back, no turning back
I'm wearing Mama's wedding dress today
