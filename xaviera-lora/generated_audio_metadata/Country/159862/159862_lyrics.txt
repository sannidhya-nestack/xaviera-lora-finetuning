My father sits on the old green sofa wearing 80 years on his face
He lost my mama back in'92
Since then he doesn't go any place
I sit beside him and I look at the hands that gave me all that's mine
And something makes me say three words
That make an old man look up and shine
And it doesn't solve the troubles of the world
It only makes his day
It's just a little I love you
But a little I love you goes a long long way
I worked a double shift today
Driving home I listened to the news
One thing gave me a headache
The other gave me the blues
But waiting for me is my little girl
She hugs me around my knees
She's just learning three new words
And she says them over and over to me
And it doesn't solve the troubles of the world
It only makes my day
It's just a little I love you
But a little I love you goes a long long way
Three words, eight letters, make somebody feel better
It's a small thing but it's a start when you
Send out a message from the heart
And it doesn't solve the troubles of the world
It only makes your day
It's just a little I love you
But a little I love you goes a long long way
It's just a little I love you
But a little I love you
Goes a long, long way
