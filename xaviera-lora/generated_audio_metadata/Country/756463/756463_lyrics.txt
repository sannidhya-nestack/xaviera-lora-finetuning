Everybody loves you
Everybody loves you
Everybody loves you like I do
People say you're really sweet
To our eyes you're a stunning treat
They should have a parade in honor of you
You draw a crowd wherever you go
You make us happy when you say hello
Your life's always in the public eye
Confetti seems to fall down from the sky, no lie
'Cause everybody loves you, everybody loves you
Everybody loves you as much as me
There's a smile always on your face
You can handle everything with grace
You shine as far as the eye can see
We all have to stop, talk and stare
To see whose designer clothes you wear
People get excited with everything you do
The red carpet was invented just for you, it's true
You're the rainbow on a stormy day
People hang on every word you say
The whole world wants to be close to you
You always help anyone in need
Your fame and fortune is guaranteed
You made the cover of a magazine
You wear the crown of a social queen, I mean
Everybody loves you, everybody loves you
Everybody loves you like I do
Everybody loves you
Everybody loves you
Everybody loves you like I do
Like I do, hey like I do
