Oh cloudy day, rain on the way
Oh, what a weary day
I wish you could stay
Sky's lookin' grey
Oh, what a dreary day
To think that the sun is as close as the warmth of your kiss
Oh, you are the one that awakens these feelings of bliss
The bed where I lay looks lonesome today
Oh, what a dreary day
The trees bow their heads and the wind I hear
Calling your name reminds me instead
I long to be with you again
Oh cloudy day
Rain on my ear
Oh what a dreary day
Oh what a dreary day
