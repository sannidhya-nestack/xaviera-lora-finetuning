I've been out here on the open road
A million miles behind us now
And yet another million more to go
I'm heading home, heading home, heading home
I always had a constant need
To move along and go somewhere
Make every single turn of a rolling stone
I'm heading home, heading home, heading home
And never ever could I settle down now
Even if I wanted to, I don't know how
It's been so long since we've been gone
The roads are home, away from home
But I'm coming back to the place where I belong
I'm heading home, heading home
Heading home, where I belong, no matter where I'll be
Because home is not a town or land, it's a place in your heart, in your mind and in your soul
Been out here on the open road
A million miles behind us now and
Yet another million more to go
I'm heading home, heading home, heading home
Yeah, I'm heading home, I'm heading home, I'm heading home
