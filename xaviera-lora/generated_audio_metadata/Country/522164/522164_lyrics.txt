Racing down that highway on a warm Nevada night
Singing along to the trucker's songs thirty miles from the Vegas lights
We were chasing after something but never really knowing why
Just trying to catch the time flying by
Trying to catch the time before it slips away
Maybe some far off tomorrow will be longing for today
So let's drink up every moment until the cup is dry
And keep trying to catch the time flying by
Alright, take it now
Now we're so much older and the clock's still running fast
Still singing along to those trucker songs like we did way in the past
And so much has changed around us but we remain the same inside
We're still trying to catch the time flying by
Trying to catch the time before it slips away
Maybe some far off tomorrow will be longing for today
So let's drink up every moment until the cup is dry
And keep trying to catch the time flying by
We're still trying to catch the time flying by
Trying to catch the time
