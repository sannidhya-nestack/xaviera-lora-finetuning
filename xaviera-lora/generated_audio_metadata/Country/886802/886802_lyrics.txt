There's a rich old man living down the street
I read in the paper he's a hundred and three
He ain't never been married, never left this town
His religion is money, he's got no friends
No one will cry when his life ends
Today's his birthday and there's no one around
You gotta feel sorry for someone like that
He'll never know what he could've had
Like singing out loud in a spirit filled church
Walking down the aisle for better or worse
Watching our son take his first step
Paying off our house being out of debt
My life isn't measured
By the breaths I take, it's by the moments that take my breath away
There's a little old lady living next door
She doesn't have money but she's not poor
Everybody loves her and that makes her rich
She raised five kids in half a neighborhood
Volunteered at the shelter as a part-time cook
She measures life by the love she gives
I gotta feel happy for someone like that
Makes me treasure moments I've had
Dad throwing me the keys to my first car
First morning you woke up in my arms
Every night when the kids yelled daddy's home
Making marks on the wall to see how they've grown
My life isn't measured by the breaths I take
It's by the moments that take my breath away
Life is more than passing years
It's not about time
It's about the times we share
Walking down the stairs in your prom dress
The tears in your eyes when you said yes
When you told me I was gonna be a dad
And the feeling I get when I look back
My life isn't measured
By the breaths I take
It's by the moments
That take my breath away
I know my life isn't measured
By the breaths I take
It's by the moments
That take my breath away
Oh, take my breath away
Take my breath away
My life
