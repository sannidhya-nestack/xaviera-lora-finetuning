I call him Mr. Independent
I've fallen and my world's abandoned
By a rockstar sexy vision burning into my brain
He's a black hat diplomat heart attacking kind of man
He leaves me breathless, I'm feeling helpless
He's a drug like no other kind
My baby leaves me breathless, I'm addicted to that devil of mine
There's nothing like a dangerous bad boy
Every good girl deserves a boy toy
A cool Casanova, bringing it to my knees
Yeah, he's a hold tight all night coming from my wildest dreams
He leaves me breathless, I'm feeling helpless
He's a drug like no other kind
My baby leaves me breathless, I'm addicted to that devil of mine
I'm no stranger to his game
Every pleasure gonna bring some pain
I'm all caught up in his reckless world
I'm a crazy, reckless, satisfied, breathless girl
He leaves me breathless, I'm feeling helpless
He's a drug like another kind
Oh my baby leave me breathless
I'm addicted to that devil of mine
He leaves me breathless, I'm feeling helpless
He's a drug like another kind
My baby leaves me breathless, I'm addicted to that devil of mine
Oh my baby leaves me breathless, I'm addicted to that devil of mine
