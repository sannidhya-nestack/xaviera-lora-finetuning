The distant stars are symbols of the night
Yet they are nothing but pure light
And in the dark hour they give sight
And a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
The mountains were born of violence and quick
They resisted not the chaos of change
Now you stand in awe at their rage
And a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
Or lover, or lord, or devil
You and I are one and the same
You and I are one and the same
The tranquil ocean, vast and vague
Though its depths may rage and sway
Still it rises high to honour each day
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
See the charming river with its sweet and tass
You could never step in that same river twice
And you would never make love to the same wife
Our roses, our roses, our roses, our rose
Our roses, our roses, our roses, our rose
Our lover, our lord, our devil
You and I are one and the same
You and I are one and the same
You and I are one and the same
You and I are one and the same
Ah, ah, ah
When the body is ash, the soul is a bird
The same flame that scorches the earth
Leaves the land infernal for rebirth
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
