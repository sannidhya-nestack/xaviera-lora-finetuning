Hot sunny days and rainy nights
A trucking job is just cheating life
I'm over the road with a heavy load
And I'm wondering'bout my lonely wife
otten down that lost highway
Watching all my dreams fade away
otten down that lost highway
Am I ever gonna see a better day?
Limp to dreams and limp to schemes
A truckin' life ain't what it seems
Eighteen wheels on the straightaway
And there ain't no time to get away
otten down that lost highway
Watchin' all my dreams fade away
otten down that lost highway
Am I ever gonna see a better day?
So tired I need to run that short
But over the road just ain't that sort
Step on the pedal big diesel wines
Looking to see them get on signs
otten down that lost highway
Watching all my dreams fade away
otten down that lost highway
Am I ever gonna see a better day
otten down that lost highway
Watching all my dreams fade away
otten down that lost highway
Am I ever gonna see a better day
Am I ever gonna see a better day
For gotten down that lost highway
