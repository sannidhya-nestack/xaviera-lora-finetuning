My new Manhattan mojo fell into a nasty fate
So I packed my weekend bag and drove my Beamer upstate
I asked this fortune teller what's this rash inside my head
But she grabbed a hold of my shoulder and said let's make love instead
I resisted her advances but she used a magic spell
When I awoke I found that she had caused my head to swell
I wrestled with this arrogance I'd never seen before
And tried to do a big tap dance to shoot it out the door
All the while I saw her smile and with a knowing wink
It's then that I first realized that we were on the brink
And she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Scootin' the mystic arts
Got these lotions and these potions that work wonders on my heart
When she casts her magic spell makes me promise not to tell
My gypsy from Poughkeepsie never fails to make me will ya
She's my gypsy
From Poughkeepsie
Yeah she's my gypsy
From Poughkeepsie
I asked her if my future held surprises she could tell
With a twinkle in her eyes
She produced a shiny gel
She smeared it on my hands
Rubbed it in my face
Before I knew what's happening
My mind gave way to chase
I've discovered that her training started centuries ago
And that payment for her expertise has become a quid pro quo
Yeah she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Schooled in the mystic arts
Got these lotions and these potions
That work wonders on my heart
When she casts her magic spell
Makes me promise not to tell
My gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Never fails to make me well
Yeah she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Yeah she's my gypsy
From Poughkeepsie
She'd sold me long ago
Down on 34th and Vine
A previous customer had got him to a barn
Yeah she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Tootin' with mystic arts
Got these lotions and these potions
That work wonders on my heart
When she casts her magic spell
Makes me promise not to tell
My gypsy from Poughkeepsie never failed
This'll make me well, yeah, she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Yeah, she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie
Yeah, she's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie, yeah
She's my gypsy from Poughkeepsie, mm, she's my gypsy, oh, from Poughkeepsie, mm
She's my gypsy
