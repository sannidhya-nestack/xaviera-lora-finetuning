Ride, ride, let's go for a ride
Remember when the summer sun was warm on our skin
We laid by the riverside
Soaking it all in
We kicked up dust in your pickup truck
On the back roads into town
And you'd say
Let's go for a ride
Just you and me
Wild and free with the radio on
Let's go for a ride
The open road keeps calling me and all I want to do
Is get away from the everyday and disappear with you
Some old highway, your way, my way, any way will do
So come on, let's go for a ride
Just you and me with the windows down to the edge of town
Let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride (let's go for a ride, yeah)
We don't know where we're going
I just wanna get there with you
Let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride, yeah
Just you and me
Wild and free with the radio on
Just you and me
With the windows down to the edge of town
Let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride, come on!
Let's go for a ride
