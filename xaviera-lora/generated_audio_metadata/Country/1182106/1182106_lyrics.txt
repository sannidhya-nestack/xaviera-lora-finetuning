Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Three hundred miles away
Might as well be the moon
I hit the ice and I lost the rope
On my way to spend the holidays with you
Your invitation was heaven
And I thought the storm was through
Halfway there came a raging snow
On my way to spend the holidays with you
I hope you're sitting by a fire
Lost in loving thoughts of me
You were all I desired
Some things were never meant to be
Can't hear the wind anymore
The last thing I'll ever do
Is leave this message so you will know
I'd have loved to spend the holidays with you
Come spring you'll know
I would have loved
To spend the holidays with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
