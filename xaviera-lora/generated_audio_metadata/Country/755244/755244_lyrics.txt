I live my life from D to D
And I take whatever comes my way
I drive for miles and miles on end
Riding on a southern wind
But I hope there's something ahead
But until then
I'll be moving on
Moving on
Moving on as far as I can go
I'm talking through the hard times
The hard times
The hard times until I cross that line
I may be living on nickels and dimes
But at least I know I tried
I read in the paper earlier today
And it said there's gonna be some change
No matter how much that I make
I'm gonna have to give it all away
So I hope there's something ahead
But until then
I'll be moving on, moving on
Moving on as far as I can go
I'm talking through the hard times
The hard times
The hard times
Until I cross that line
I may be living on nickels and dimes
But at least you'll know I tried
I can see there's a rough road ahead
But we've been through it once, we can do it again
And keep moving on, moving on
Moving on as far as we can go
I'm talking through the hard times
The hard times, the hard times, until we cross that line
We may be living on nickels and dimes
We may be living on nickels and dimes
But at least we'll know we tried
Yeah, I know we tried
