You loved a man, he let you go
He'll realize his mistake someday soon
And when he comes back to claim your love
Darling, this is what I hope you will do
Tell him
You love me and that my love for you is strong and true
Tell him that we love each other faithfully
Tell him you love me
Thank him for all, all that he's done
Thank him for the sweet love that you feel
Tell him it worked out for the best
when you lost him you found love that's real
Tell him
You love me and that my love for you is strong and true
Tell him that we love each other faithfully
Tell him you love me
Tell him you love me
Tell him you love me
Tell him you love me
