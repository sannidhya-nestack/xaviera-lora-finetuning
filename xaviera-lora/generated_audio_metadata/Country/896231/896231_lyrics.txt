Crickets sing in harmony to the radio
Moonbeams dance across the sky as we held each other close
I swear I saw the moon smile right before we kissed
Oh, someone after my own heart
Could have planned a night like this
And only the woman in the moon
Could arrange the stars just right
So I'd see heaven shining in your eyes
And only the woman in the moon
Would I judge the right touch
To make the perfect night for us to fall in love
Sweet magnolias in the air
Now the cloud inside
Running barefoot in the grass
Chasing fireflies
I smiled about the full moon
When you gave me your ring
only someone watching over us
Would've thought of everything
And only the woman and the moon
Could arrange the stars just right
So I see heaven shining in your eyes
And only the woman and the moon
Would add just the right touch
To make the perfect night for us to fall in love
Ooh, leave the woman and the moon
Would I just the right touch
To make the perfect night for us to fall in love
The woman and the moon
The woman and the moon
The woman in the moon
