I can throw away the chairs
Don't need this old canoe
I can get rid of the fridge
And chuck these worn out shoes
When this house has gotta go
I can dump the barbecue
I can clean out the garage
But there's one thing I can't do
Baby I just can't let you go
These memories will not fade as if they're cast in stone
Painted, fired and glazed, you're with me all the time
Your heart's all that I know, you said move on, I'm trying
But baby I just can't let you go
Look at this worn out couch, all tattered and all stained
It's really gotta go, it'll never be the same
And the dumpster's almost full, everything must go
Nothing's coming with me except the one thing I know
Baby I just can't let you go
His memories will not fade
As if they're cast in stone
Painted, fired and glazed
You're with me all the time
Your heart's all that I know
You said move on, I'm trying
But baby I just can't let you go
I'm stuck inside the dream of the life we once shared
Don't wanna lose that feeling I had when you still cared
Baby I just can't let you go
These memories will not fade
As if they're cast in stone
Painted, fired, and glazed
You're with me all the time
Your heart's all that I know
You said move on, I'm trying
But baby I just can't let
Oh I just can't let
I just can't let
You go on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
