Nothing ain't on your side of the closet
The porch swings swaying empty in the evening breeze
One day we had it all, next day we lost it
Where it's gone to is still a mystery to me
We had that, didn't we girl
The best thing in the world
Never thought I'd need to want you back
Love at first sight, loving all night
Loving you always felt so right
Through our fingers and out of our hands, yeah
We had that
Note you left still up on the bedroom mirror
It says, I didn't think I'd ever feel this way
I wanna grow old with you and all I ever wished for
Can life just stay as sweet as it is today?
We had that
Didn't we girl
The best thing in the world
Never thought I'd need to want you back
Love at first sight
Lovin' all night
Lovin' you always felt so right
Through our fingers
And out of our hands yeah
We had that
Not trying to fence you in
I just wanna feel your heart beat next to mine again
We had that you and me girl
Up on top of the world
I'm still here, so baby, come on back, yeah
To the very best thing we ever had
Yeah, we had that
Yeah, we had that
Yeah
