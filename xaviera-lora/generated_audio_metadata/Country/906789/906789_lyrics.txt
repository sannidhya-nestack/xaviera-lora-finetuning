She's running in my blood
She's running through my veins
She's running through my mind
All night and all day
She's got me tied up
She's got me knocked down
She's got me waiting
She's out running around
Got the smile of an angel, it'll melt your heart
She got the devil's temper, she'll tear you apart
It's like an addiction, I can't say no, and I tried to leave her
I couldn't let her go
She hits hard like a whiskey
She's smooth like gin
She can party like tequila
She'll wake up and do it again
She's classy like a pinot
Got an edge like shine
She's beautiful, she's crazy and she won't be mine
She's like wine and shine
She drives an Eldorado, she got it from her dad
Said she grew up in Chicago, think she grew up a little too fast
She only smokes hard packs, she got that from her mom
She lost her brother to the junk in his arm
She sings songs like Bonnie, plays an old guitar
Says I can't make you love me in a smoke filled bar
She hits hard like a whiskey
She's smooth like gin
She can party like tequila
She'll wake up and do it again
She's classy like a pinot
Got an edge like shine
She's beautiful, she's crazy and she won't be mine
A love that leaves you with a hangover in the morning
But it's worth it
Every time she smiles
She's like wine and shine
She's fading fast, I see it in her eyes
Said she's leaving in the spring, but I know it's a lie
And the morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me'til then to give up this fight
She hits hard like a whiskey, she's smooth like gin
She can party like tequila, she'll wake up and do it again
She's classy like a pinot, got an edge like shine
She's beautiful, she's crazy and she won't be mine
A love that leaves you with a hangover in the morning
But it's worth it
Every time she smiles she's like wine and shine
