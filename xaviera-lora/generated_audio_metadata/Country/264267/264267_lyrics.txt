Didn't know what I was getting myself into
The day I lent my favorite cowboy hat to you
You broke me rough and you put your little brand on me
And now you lead me by the reins for the judges to see
You're bustin' wild hearts
Eight seconds and you're gone
Lovin' you is like a rodeo
The harder I try to stay on
The further off I'm thrown
I'd rather ride on a bareback Bronco
Lovin' you
It's like a rodeo
You roped and tied me up, you put your saddle on me
You raced me round the barrels, dig your spurs in deep
This time those horns of yours have really hooked me good
You throw a mean lasso like a cowgirl should
Am I just a cow hand for your one woman show?
Loving you is like a rodeo
The harder I try to stay on a further off I'm thrown
I'd rather ride on a bareback Bronco
Loving you is like a rodeo
You know how to buck baby
When it's your turn to go round
Stop trying to turn me into your rodeo clown
Loving you
It's like a rodeo
The harder I try to stay on
The further off I'm thrown
I'd rather ride on a bareback Bronco
Loving you is like a rodeo
