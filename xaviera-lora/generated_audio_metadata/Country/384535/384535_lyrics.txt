Some September morning
We will look into each other's eyes
See the tears of sweet iveness falling
Some September morning
We will promise not to turn away
And we will answer when we hear love calling
We will take each other's hand
And surrender to God's plan without fearing
Walking side by side
Knowing that the cloudy skies are finally clearing
The sun appearing
Some September morning
We'll wake up from our sleeping
To the sound of words of kindness softly spoken
Some September morning
We will feel the touch that brings on
The healing love to hearts that have been broken
We will find ourselves at peace
And we will find release from all this longing
And the darkness of the night
It will vanish in the light of new day dawning
Some September morning
We will find ourselves at peace
And we will find release from all this longing
And the darkness of the night
It will vanish in the light of new day dawning
Some September morning
Some September morning, on some September morning
