She moves so slow and patiently
As she slides inside my heart
Pushing all my buttons from the very start
Mmm, one moment softly smiling
Rose petals in her hair
The next she's screaming wildly
Of her nightmares in my ear, yeah
Here comes majestic beauty
Spittin' in my face
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
I don't want no amnesty
Can't bear this love to waste
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
With childhood wonderment
She winks and throws a kiss
And captivates my heart
As if nothing's amiss
My love for her's a curse
Torments me every day
Just like a desert thirst
I live in shades of grey, yeah, yeah
Here comes majestic beauty
Spitting in my face
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
I don't want no amnesty
Can't bear this love to waste
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
This woman that I love
With hip psychotic pain
Fills my soul with joy
Lovely as the rain
Here comes majestic beauty, spinning in my face
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
I don't want no amnesty
Can't bear this love to waste
Sweetness and tragedy
Stunning in its grace
Oh, yeah
