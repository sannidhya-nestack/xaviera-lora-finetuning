I would run into you
When I look like a mess
It's really just my brand new look
I have not been depressed
Look at me I'm flying
I can't remember crying
All those times trying to make you love me
They're safe for every yes
There's a hundred miles
Good thing I'm so strong
There's ninety-nine heartaches to blow
Do you have a brother
Who's anything like you
Or maybe 98 good friends who all can hurt me too
It hurts
Look at me I'm flyin' (I'm flyin')
I can't remember cryin' (I'm stayin' up late)
All those times tryin' to make you love me (the love)
I say for every year (I'm too low)
There's a hundred more (I'm not strong)
Good thing I'm so strong
There's 99 heartaches to go on
Walk away
I'll find Mr. 101 someday
Yeah, oh
They say for every year
There's a hundred no's
Good thing I'm so strong
There's ninety-nine heartaches
Ninety-nine heartaches to go, yeah
I would run into you when I look like a mess
It's really just my brand new love that I've been depressed
