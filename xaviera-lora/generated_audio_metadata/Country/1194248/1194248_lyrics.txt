How could you turn and walk away and leave a fire burning?
There's a way when there's still embers stirring around, around, around
It's still warm to the touch, I still feel it so much
It could take a force and burn it down, down, down
I tried blowing it out with one big breath
Smothering it to death
Baby, it just won't cool down
I tried stomping it to the ground
I even tried dowsing it down
But baby, you're the fire I can't put out
Just when I think it's gonna die
That spark lights up and gives it life
It makes me turn right back around, around, around
You're too wild to contain
The only way out is up in flames
Until I'm ashes on the ground, ground, ground
I tried blowing it out with one big breath
Smothering it to death, baby
It just won't cool down
I tried stomping it to the ground
I even tried dowsing it down
But baby, you're the fire I can't put out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I tried blowing it out with one big breath
Smothering it to death, baby, it just won't cool down
I tried stomping it to the ground
I even tried dowsing it down
But baby, you're the fire I can't put out
Baby, you're the fire I can't put out
How could you turn and walk away and leave a fire burning?
There's a way when there's still embers stirring round and round and round
