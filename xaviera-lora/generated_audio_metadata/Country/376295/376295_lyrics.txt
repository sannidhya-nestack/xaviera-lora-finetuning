Some people say that this old world turns too fast
And nothing seems to stay the same or ever last
What used to take a lifetime now ends in a day
But not everything is meant to be a throwaway
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you all the time
Even when you're grumpy and all you do is whine
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
On our honeymoon we were living good
We drank from each other's love like lovers should
Well I treasure those memories and I hold them tight
now when I get close I hear, not tonight
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you all the time
Even when you're grumpy and all you do is whine
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
Troubles come and we have some now
But everything will work out somehow
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you all the time
Even when you're grumpy and all you do is whine
I'm gonna love you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you, rain or shine
