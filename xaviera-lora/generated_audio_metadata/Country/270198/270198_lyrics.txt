She was younger, I was older
It won't last, that's what I told her
But she insisted and I gave in
It was an argument I didn't really want to win
I was trapped, she was free
I didn't know what she saw in me
She still had dreams where I had regrets
The world is cruel but she didn't know that yet
She's full of hope for what might be
And I'm full of sorrow for what might have been
She wants to see all there is to see
But it's too late for me to live my life again
She wants to set this world on fire
But I'm afraid I lack the proper spark
And I know it's wrong to ask her to stay here with me in the dark
She moved in
We pooled our stuff
I had too much
She didn't have enough
I liked my things
She liked her space
Pretty soon we had to find a bigger place
She was focused while I was torn
She was brand new where I was worn
She was joyful when I was sad
She must have thought that I relished feeling bad
She's full of hope for what might be
And I'm full of sorrow for what might have been
She wants to see
All there is to see
But it's too late for me
To live my life again
She wants to set this world on fire
But I'm afraid I lack a proper spark
And I know it's wrong to ask her to stay here
With me in the dark
She was freezing when I was hot
She was teasing when I was not
I acted like a man, she acted like a kid
I knew the day would come
And come it did
She's full of hope for what might be
And I'm full of sorrow for what might have been
She wants to see all there is to see
But it's too late for me to live my life again
She wants to say
This world on fire
But I'm afraid I lack
The proper spark
And I know it's wrong
To ask her to stay here
With me in the dark
With me in the dark
With me in the dark
With me in the dark
