Tried on city life for size
Never seemed to fit me right
Tall buildings blocked the warm sunshine
Open space was hard to find
I guess I'm just a backwards fool
Noise and traffic ain't in my gene pool
deep inside of me
Flowing through my veins are hills and creeks
My family roots won't grow down through concrete
I'm headed back on home
My redneck ain't skin deep
I'm country to the bone
Horseback rides down red dirt roads
Take me where I wanna go
Back to town my little spread
Smell the pines and fresh baked bread
Work the earth with my two hands
Till I'm one with the land
It's deep inside of me
Flowin' through my veins are hills and creeks
My family roots won't grow down through concrete
I'm headed back on home
My redneck ain't skin deep
I'm country to the bone
Cities spring up awful fast, but buildings crumble
Mountains of last deep inside me
Floating through my veins are hills and creeks
My family roots won't grow down through concrete
I'm headed back on home
My redneck gang skin deep
I'm country to the bone
Yeah, I'm country to the bone
Country to the bone
