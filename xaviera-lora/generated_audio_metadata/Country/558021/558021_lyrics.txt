Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cry
If you don't give me rye whiskey, I surely will die
If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom, Lord, I'd never come up
But the ocean ain't whiskey and I ain't no duck
So line'em up, boys, let's get drunk
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cry
If you don't give me rye whiskey, I surely will die
I'm going to the mountain so I may roam
Do what you will or just leave me alone
I'm drunk as the devil, I'm stoned and I'm blind
I live this kind of life cause I got trouble on the mind
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey I cry
If you don't give me rye whiskey I slowly will die
Well, I've been drinking since you went away
Just for singing my blues and digging my grave
When night I hold guests six feet deep
I will put down my banjo and go to sleep
My whiskey, my whiskey, my whiskey, I cry
If you don't get me wrong, whiskey, I surely will die
I eat when I'm hungry, I drink when I'm dry
If the blues don't kill me, I will live'til I die
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cry
If you don't give me rye whiskey, I sue
