There was a time when we needed each other
You'd say my name and my head would spin
Honestly honey I couldn't get enough
I'd like to chase that feeling again
It seemed like love just slipped away
No more kisses or romantic things
I'm done with missus attached to my name
Take it all but the diamond ring
Blue sky is on my horizon
I might drive east or visit Carolina
Or head to Virginia Beach
Where the waiters serve ya
With just about nothing on
I need a tan, a bottle of wine
A favorite book, it's sweet summertime
I think it's time I put this truck in dry
For blue skies
I can't say I'm losing something
Hell, you'd have to have something first
We don't talk, we don't touch, we don't care
I'm invisible, that's the worst
Blue sky
'Cause on my horizon I might drive east or visit Carolina
Or head to Virginia Beach where the waiters serve ya
With just about nothin' on
I need a tan, a bottle of wine, a favorite book, it's sweet summertime
I think it's time I put this truck in drive for blue skies
I'm here, I made it through
A little bruised but I'm okay
It's time to hit the road
Take a chance, come what may
Blue sky, it's on my horizon
I might drive east or visit Carolina
Or head to Virginia Beach
Where the waiters serve ya
With just about nothing on
I need a tan, a bottle of wine
A favorite book, it's sweet summertime
I think it's time I put this truck in drive
For blue sky
I'm headed for blue sky
