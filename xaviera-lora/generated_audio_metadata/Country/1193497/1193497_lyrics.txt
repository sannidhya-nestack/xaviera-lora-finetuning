I see you huddled with your crowd
Talking, laughing, your hair tossed back
You give me a sideways glance
Waiting for me to ask you to dance
Infatuation girl is flirting with me
But tonight it's clear that I would be
Just the next heart you'd break into
Infatuation girl
That smile won't pull me in
Oh I know you've got a reputation
Won't let you in my world
Infatuation girl
Mmmhmm
The band's starting on something slow
In your red tight jeans you walk my way
Those big green eyes have lots to say
But you might as well turn around go sit down and stay
Infatuation girl is flirting with me
But tonight it's clear that I would be
Just the next heart you'd break into
Infatuation girl, that smile won't pull me in
Oh I know you've got a reputation, won't let you in my world
Infatuation girl, I'm not gonna be like the other guys I know
Hooked by your claws then left out in the cold
No, infatuation girl
Is flirting with me
But tonight it's clear that I would be
Just the next heart you break into
Yeah, infatuation girl
That smile won't pull me in
Yeah I know about your reputation
Won't let you in my world
Infatuation girl
Here's a man you'll never hurt
Infatuation girl
Yeah yeah
Infatuation girl
