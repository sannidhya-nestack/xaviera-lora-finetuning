Used to be a square, nobody special
Just a loner feeling like I don't fit in
Didn't have no style, not much to look at
Until the day that little cowgirl roped me in
I was nothing till I met that girl
Just a loser in a winner's world
Then she built me up like only a woman could
I'd still be no one if she left me now
She makes me someone with her love somehow
Yeah she makes me look good
Now people think I'm cool, somebody special
Got lots of friends and I'm riding high
They think I'm sharp, they say I'm good looking
But it's only true when I'm by her side
Yeah, I was nothing'til I met that girl
Just a loser in a winner's world
Then she built me up like only a woman could
I'd still be no one if she left me now
She makes me someone with her love somehow
Yeah, she makes me look good
Yeah, she makes me look good
