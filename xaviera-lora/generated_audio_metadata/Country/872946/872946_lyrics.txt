They say you're working late again, uh-huh, uh-huh
So me and the girls are out for a little fun, uh-huh
And now it's hard to believe my eyes
Maybe sweet baby it's just the light
You're walking through that door with a blunt surprise
You're busted
Boy, you're so damn busted
I should've known all along how you spend your time
your love ain't even worth a dime
You're busted, boy
You're so damn busted
She's rockin' boots and cut-off jeans, uh-huh
Uh-huh, she don't look a bit over seventeen
Uh-huh, uh-huh, she's holding on to you real tight
Just like your son kind of cries
But right now I'm done with all your stupid lies
You're busted
Boy, you're so damn busted
Now I know your love has a price that I won't pay
And now it's all gone up in flames, you're busted, boy
And now you're the one who can't believe your eyes
Just like a deer caught in the headlights
I drop my ring into your drink
I wonder what your girlfriend thinks
You're busted
Man you're so damn busted
It's not surprising the girl just up and walked away
What's that I swear I heard her say
You're busted
Boy, you're so damn busted
Lord, you're so damn busted
Oh, man, you're busted
Boy, you're so damn busted
Oh, you gotta be busted
There's no way out, you're busted
You drop like a fox, you're busted, yeah
You're so busted
