Ripped jeans, acid wash and neon
Newest truck, latest tech, it goes on
Trends come along and then they go
Life can be such a fashion show
Some things don't go out of style
Like loving someone and making them smile
The best things in life are free
Some things don't go out of style
Sharing a sunset or a newborn child
Some things just don't go out of style
Getting lost in the endless hype
Living online every day and night
Don't get me wrong, now it all matters
Ain't no real payback from the chatter
Some things don't go out of style
Like kicking back with your friends for a while
The best things in life are free
Some things don't go out of style
This country's beauty, mile after mile
Yeah, some things just don't go out of style
Some things don't go out of style
Like loving someone and making them smile
The best things in life are free
The best things in life are free
Some things don't go out of style
Some things just don't go out of style
