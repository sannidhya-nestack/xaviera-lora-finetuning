Yeah, this old heart
Has seen its share of good times
I know when love and everyday just seem brand new
But it don't know those times are over
It just refuses to let go
this old heart
Still in love with you
Yeah I keep saying hard
We should go out looking
Find another love
Another dream that might come true
It don't matter what I say it keeps on going its own way
this old heart is still in love with you
And I keep saying, "Harp, we should go out looking"
And find another love, another dream that might come true
But it don't matter what I say, it keeps on going its own way
this old heart is still in love with you
Yeah, it don't matter what I say, it just wants you back to stay
this old heart is still in love with you
Yet his own heart is still in love with you
