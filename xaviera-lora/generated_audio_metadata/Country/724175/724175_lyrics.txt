After the rain there's always a rainbow
Above the clouds there's always the blue
And beyond the mountains there's always the ocean
Behind every lie there's always some truth
A day once came and everything changed
And that was the day when I met you
And after that day nothing seems strange anymore
It was like lightning out of the blue
When I found you
After each night there's always a morning
And after the darkness there's always a light
After a journey there's always a new home
And after the tears there's always a smile, oh
A day once came and everything changed
That was the day when I met you
And after that day nothing seemed strange anymore
It was like lightning out of the blue when I found you
A day once came and everything changed
That was the day when I met you
And after that day nothing seems strange anymore
It was like lightning out of the blue
When I found you
