Now that I've found you
I know that others were so wrong
Led me from a world of smoke and mirrors
Oh, the only place I've ever known
The love that you've given to me
Shines brighter than a thousand suns
Now I believe (now I believe)
Now that you're here with me
I can't let go all of my fears
All my fears (all my fears)
Have all disappeared (have disappeared)
That I fell for all these years (all these years)
I can't let go all of my fears
Never could I imagine
That I can see so clear
And how it feels to hold you
How it feels to live so free
But now I believe (now I believe)
Now that you're here with me (here with me)
I can let go all of my fears
All my fears (all my fears)
Have all disappeared (have disappeared)
That I've held for all these years
I can let go all of my fears
Round and round and round I go
My life was like a revolving door
You caught my eye and you calmed the storm
Here in your arms I am safe, no more
Now I believe (now I believe)
Now that you're here with me
I can't let go all of my fears
All my fears (all my fears)
Have all disappeared (have disappeared)
That I fell for all these years (all these years)
I have let go all of my fears
I have let go of all my fears
I have let go of all of my fears
That's why I thank you, my dear
