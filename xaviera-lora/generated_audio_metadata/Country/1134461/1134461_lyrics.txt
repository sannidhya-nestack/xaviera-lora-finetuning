Whispers on the phone as I pass by
Giving me your cheek as I try to kiss you
My eyes filled with tears trying not to cry
I saw on your phone she text I miss you
Shame on you for the secrets you're keeping
Shame on you for lying to my face
If she was just a friend why are you scheming?
Shame on you for giving our love away
Affairs don't start in the bedroom
They begin with hello how are you
I can see you looking right through me
Like she's in the room
My love was never demanding
Keep the diamonds, the house material things
Shame on you'cause I caught you cheating
Shame on you for walking away
If she was just a friend, why are you scheming?
Shame on you for giving our love away
Shame on you'cause I caught you cheating
Shame on me for loving you anyway
Shame on me for wanting to keep you
Shame on you for walking away
