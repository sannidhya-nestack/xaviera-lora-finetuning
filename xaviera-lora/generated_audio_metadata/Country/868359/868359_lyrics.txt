Listen to the jukebox, jukebox playin'
You could dance to the rhythm of my radio station
Ooh, I'm lookin' at you, girl
Long long legs and cowboy boots
You got a red leather jacket and a new tattoo
Come a little closer, come on over
And talk sweet talk to me
Sweet talk, sweet talk baby
Sweet talk is making me crazy
Sweet talk, talk sweet talk to me
Sweet talk, sweet don't stop and it's sweet like sugar in a candy shop
Sweet, sweet, so sweet, girl you talk so sweet
I can see you looking through the smokey air
You're sitting with your friends, you can see me staring
Ooh, all eyes on you, girl
We could start a party
I could feel your body
You're a beach-blowing hottie
And a dancing queen
Come a little closer
Come on over
And talk sweet talk to me
Sweet talk, sweet talk, baby
Sweet talk is making me crazy
Sweet talk, talk sweet talk to me
Sweet, sweet, don't, sweet, don't stop me
Sweet like sugar in a candy shop
Sweet, sweet, so sweet
Girl you talk so sweet like sugar
Sweet like pie
G ia beaches on the 4th of July
Sweet like summer, morning rain
Like chocolate covered cherries, baby
Sweet talk, sweet talk, baby
Sweet talk is making me crazy
Sweet talk, talk, sweet talk to me
Sweet talk, sweet talk, stop and sweep
Like sugar in a candy shop
Sweet, sweet, so sweet
Girl, you talk so sweet
Girl, you talk so sweet
You know you talk so
Girl you're top so sweet
Girl you're top so sweet
