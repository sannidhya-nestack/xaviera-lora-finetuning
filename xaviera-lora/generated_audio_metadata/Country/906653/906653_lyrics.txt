I've never heard something more painful than the sound of your voice not coming out
Tell me what's in your head
I've never felt so far from ease
I'd rather hear devastating honesty
Coming out, tell me what's in your head
Don't shy away, I wanna hear you with face to face
You'll never get a better view, just speak
Don't hold the words on your lips
I've never heard a louder silence, let it out
Just speak, just speak, oh yeah
I've never seen something more painful than the sight of your lips pressed tightly shut
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't shy away I wanna hear you
We're face to face you'll never get a better view just speak
Don't hold the words behind your lips
I've never heard a louder silence, let it out
Just speak, just speak, oh yeah
Your fragile words, they could break
But you can trust me with them, yes you can trust me with them anyway
Don't shy away, I wanna hear you
We're face to face, you'll never get a better view
Just speak
Don't hold the words behind your lips
I've never heard a louder silence, let it out
Just speak
Just speak
Just speak
Don't shy away, I wanna hear you
We're face to face, you'll never get a better view
Just speak
Don't hold the words behind your lips
I've never heard a louder silence, let it out
Just speak, just speak
