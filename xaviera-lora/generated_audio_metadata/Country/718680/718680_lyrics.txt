We lie alone each night, face to face, together
And as I watch you dream, search for a trace of forever
But your eyes are closing, I can't see the truth
Gotta shake you up, get through to you
Do you love me?
Do you love me, baby? I just gotta know
Do you love me?
Do you love me? If you don't then let me go
We're living separate lives, you and I together
You built the wall so high
I gotta find a way to reach you
But your eyes are closed and you won't see the truth
I gotta shake you up and get through to you
Do you love me?
Do you love me baby?
I just gotta know
Do you love me?
Do you love me? If you don't then let me go
I've been giving it all, loving blind
Stay or go, make up your mind
I've got half your heart, I want a love that's whole
Love me or leave, I've gotta know
Open up your eyes so you can see the truth
I gotta wake you up and get through to you
Do you love me?
Do you love me, baby?
I just gotta know
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
If you don't then let me go
If you don't then let me go
