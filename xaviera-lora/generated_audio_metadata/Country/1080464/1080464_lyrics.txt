I'm not the kind of girl you can call after midnight
But tonight I might make an exception, let it slide
It just so happens that I ain't got nothing to do
You think you're lucky
But you don't know who's using who
So what, it ain't right
My heart's got a mind of its own
And it doesn't listen or reason
When you come around
Tonight I ain't looking for more than not being out alone
I'm just looking for someone who knows how to feed this Jones
So tell all your friends you came over
And had a good time
They all know you and me
It's just your world against mine
And hell, I'm an angel
So who do you think they'll believe?
The door is unlocked
Come and bring out the devil in me
So what it ain't right
My heart's got a mind of its own
And it doesn't listen to reason
When you come around
Tonight I ain't looking for more than not being ever alone
I'm just looking for someone who knows how to fade these tones
Tonight I ain't looking for more than not being alone
I'm just looking for someone who knows how to feed these joints
