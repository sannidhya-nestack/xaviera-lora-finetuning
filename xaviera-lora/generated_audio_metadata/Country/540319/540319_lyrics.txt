A world where angels play
Listen to what they say
A world where angels play
Invited here and now they stay
You belong inside
It opens, yes it opens
Opens wide
Enters freely on love's tide
Inside it opens wide
A world where angels play
Bring light to the night and love today
You belong inside
It opens, yes it opens, opens wide
And just breathe the unloved tight
Inside it opens wide for you
For you
You belong
You belong
You belong
