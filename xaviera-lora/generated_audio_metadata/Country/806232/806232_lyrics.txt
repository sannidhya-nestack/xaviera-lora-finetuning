The very first time I saw you
I could see it in your eyes
That you, you were so special
And it came as a surprise
You walked right up to me
And asked me for a dance
Now it's our wedding day
Today's very special
It's the best day of our lives
Two of us now, one husband and wife
We'll face each day together
Grow stronger every day
On this our wedding day
Let's dance on our wedding day
On our wedding day
Let's dance to the songs we
The songs we used to play
Let's dance to our favorite songs
To our favorite songs
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance at our wedding, let's dance at our wedding, let's dance at our wedding day
The first time that I saw you
I could see it in your eyes
That you, you were so special
And it came as a surprise
When you walked right up to me
And asked me for a dance
Now it's our wedding day
Let's dance on our wedding day
On our wedding day
Let's dance to the songs we
The songs we used to play
Let's dance to our favorite songs
Our favorite songs
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance on our wedding day, on our wedding day
Let's dance to the songs we, the songs we used to play
Let's dance to our favorite songs, our favorite songs
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Oh let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
