I go walking by the river at night when I can't get no sleep
It's half and half the dreams I'm having and the ones that'll never be
'Cause even I ain't worth the trouble if I can't have you next to me
I go swimming in the river at night though I hear it's rough and deep
It's half and half the girl I have and the one I'll never meet
It's half past twelve I'll drown, six she'll come and rescue me
Switchblade in my pocket, flashlight in my hand
This half and half to find my gal and to kill her other man
Cause this loving ain't worth the trouble if you only give it half to me
And being free ain't worth the trouble if I can't have you next to me
