Lonely night
One more lonely night
As shadows grow
Just like the sun I'm sinking low
Deeper into this memory of you and me
To darkness is all I'll see
That's alright, it's only one more lonely night
How slowly the weary hours go by
While visions of love that used to be
Are haunting me with bittersweet memories
That's alright, it's only one more lonely night
Lonely night
One more lonely night
In restless dreams
I'm reliving all those loves
But I know you're not really there and you don't care
Gone is the love we shared
That's alright, it's only one more lonely night
Lonely
One more lonely night
One more lonely night
Lonely night
