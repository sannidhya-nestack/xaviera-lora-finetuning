May every dream you have someday come true
And every prayer you speak be answered for you
And every night you go through may you never be blue
When you walk through a storm
May you see the sunshine
And may every day be
Filled with laughter and wine
May life smile on you
May you never be blue
Had my share of trouble
Somehow bounce right back
You'll find your troubles
Somehow seem to double
If you don't have that fact
May you always smile
Even on your last mile
See the good times ahead
When the darkness is near
My heart is with you
May you never be blue
Had my share of troubles
But somehow bounced right back
You'll find your troubles somehow seem to double
If you don't have that back
May you always smile
Even on your last mile
See the good times ahead
When the darkness is near
Oh my heart is with you
May you never be blue
Oh my heart is with you
May you never be blue
