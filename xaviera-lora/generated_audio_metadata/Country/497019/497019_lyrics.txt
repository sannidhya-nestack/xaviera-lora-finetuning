I know you think I play the fool most of the time
There's no hill or mountain I wouldn't try to climb for you
I do my best to make you laugh when you're a little blue
I am all the better too
Because of you
Because of you
My life is a wonder
Because of you
I feel much stronger every day
Because of you
I'm a rich girl
A queen without a crown
I always want you near and I'm here because of you
I know you think I play the fool most of the time
But if you don't say I love you
I really don't mind
I know I'll never meet a guy
Who gives me what you do
I am all the better too
Because of you
Because of you
My life is a wonder
Because of you
I feel much stronger every day
Because of you
I'm a rich girl
A queen without a crown
I always want you near
And I'm here
Because of you
Because of you, my life is a wonder
Because of you, I feel much stronger every day
Because of you, I'm a rich girl, a queen without a crown
I always want you near
And I'm here
Because of you
I'm a rich girl
A queen without a crown
I always want you near
And I'm here
Because of you
Because of you
