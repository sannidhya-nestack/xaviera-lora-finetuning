I'm gonna run to the country in the crystal air
In the sweet magnolia tree
Far from the city and all its cares
Beating down on me
I'm gonna dance to the music in my G ia heart
Under the Savannah moon
Laugh and sing'til my blues depart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart, yeah
I'm going to see my folks and my little brother Bill and a girl by the name of Ann
I'll take her on up to Hollow Hill and ask her for her hand
I'm going to dance to the music in my G ia heart under the Savannah moon
I'll laugh and sing till my blues depart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
I guess I had to leave before I could see
G ia is the only place I want to be
I'm bringing home now
I've been gone too long
Tomorrow morning at the very crack of dawn I'll be on my way
I'll head on out to the railroad track and catch a southbound train
I'm gonna dance to the music in my G ia heart under the Savannah moon
Laugh and sing'til my blues depart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart
Dance to the music in my G ia heart, yeah
Oh, bring it home now
I've been gone too long
