You're a two-timing tool, man, and a crafty operator
Everything you touch seems to fall apart
You chisel away at our love every day
You're fixin' to break my heart
It's a do or die, make or break situation
It'll take every little bit of your handyman's art
I can tell by that stare that you don't care
To make the repair you're fixing to break my heart
You're working on a girl
Over in the corner
You've been playing with our love
Right from the start
Don't be surprised
I can see it in your eyes
You're fixing to break my heart
It's a do or die, make or break situation
It'll take every little bit of your handyman's art
I can tell by that stare that you don't care
To make the repair you're fixing
To break my heart
There was a time you put me on a pedestal
But lately I've been hanging on a lover's cross
It's a do or die, make or break situation
It'll take every little bit of your handyman's art
I can tell by that stare that you don't care
To make the repair you're fixin' to break my heart
You're fixin' to break my heart
Oh, you're fixin' to break my heart
