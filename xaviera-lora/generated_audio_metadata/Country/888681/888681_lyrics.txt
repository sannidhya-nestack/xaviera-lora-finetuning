Late for work, when just my luck
I ran over something, so I stopped my truck
Thought I hit a dog or it could have been a cat
Thank God all I hit was a canvas bag
As I picked it up I swear the devil winked
I saw a bag full of dreams when I read Property of Brinks
A mansion on the lakeshore would be sweet
My little fixer-upper's gonna bankrupt me
Who wouldn't want a hundred foot yacht
My old bass boat breaks down a lot
Heaven help me, this is tempting as hell
But no matter how I live, I gotta live with myself
Headlines read, "Man gives back loot"
Lord, how my life changed by the six o'clock news
My best friend called to call me a fool
Said we could have been on a beach in Cancun
People at work made up jokes about me
That's their right, but I still think I did the right thing
Go ahead and call me crazy
That's the way my mama raised me
My little fixer-upper's looking good to me
In twenty more years I'll be mortgage free
Yeah my old bass boat breaks down a lot
But it still gets me to my favorite spot
Heaven help me
It was tempting as hell
But no matter how I live
No matter how I live
No matter how I live
I gotta live with myself
