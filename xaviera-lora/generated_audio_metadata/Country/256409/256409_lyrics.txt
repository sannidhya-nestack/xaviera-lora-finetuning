Hey there girl
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
How about it little girl
Hey there girl
Are you lonely just like me?
Don't you need some company?
How about it little girl?
Hey there girl
Let me take you to the dance
Won't you give me one more chance
Aw, you lonely little girl
Your mommy and daddy don't like me
And your brother hates me too
But that don't mean a thing to me
I could make your dreams come true
Hey there girl
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
How about it little girl
You mommy and daddy don't like me
And your brother hates me too
But that don't mean a thing to me
I'm still in love with you
Hey there girl
Won't you take this diamond ring
It will make you laugh and sing
How'bout it little girl? Hey there girl!
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
How'bout it little girl? Hey there girl
Won't you ride in my new car?
You're just as lovely like you are
How about it little girl
Hey there girl
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
How about it little girl
La la la la la, la la la la la la
