I'm head over heels and homeward bound
And the rain on this road won't slow me down
I called and you said you still love me
So I'm head over heels and homeward bound
That job I took in Tulsa
Was going fine
But the nights were too lonely
And each day I only had you on my mind
That's why I'm head over heels and homeward bound
And the rain on this road won't slow me down
I called and you said you still love me
So I'm head over heels and homeward bound
As the lightning flashes, I can see
The old water tower, I'll be home within the hour
Right where I should be
I'm glad I'm head over heels and homeward bound
And the rain on this road won't slow me down
I called and you said you still love me
So I'm head over heels and homeward bound
I'm head over heels and homeward bound
And the rain on this road won't slow me down
I called and you said you still love me
So I'm head over heels and homeward
Head over heels and homeward
Head over heels and homeward bound
