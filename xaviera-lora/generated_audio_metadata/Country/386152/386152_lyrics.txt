He's led a life of danger
A life that's filled with sin
He's called a lonesome bandit
Only he knows where he's been
He's led a life of dangerous dreams
There's many cursed his name
He's been told to hide away
And live his life in shame
And when he'll reach that silver sky
They say he'll slip on past the guard
And sneak into the back door of heaven
He's been a branded gambler
It only makes him grin
To think in all the dealing
He'd lose more than he'd win
It's just his fate to play the thief
To fill the sky with pain
Make the clouds break down and cry
Tears of driving rain
And when he'll reach that silver sky
They say he'll slip on past the guard
And sneak into the back door of heaven
