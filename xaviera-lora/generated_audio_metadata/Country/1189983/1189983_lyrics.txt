No more lying, I ain't denying
Girl, I'm drinking about you
But it ain't what you're thinking
The freedom bell's ringing
And I'm anything but blue
Seeing you with someone else
Should've heard like hell
But the fairy tale ended long before you said farewell
Now you're somebody else's perfect
Oh, at least for a while
'Til the smoke cloud clears and the real you appears
And the new guy ets how to smile
Hope you have a good life, if you don't that's alright
I won't be losing any sleep
You're somebody else's perfect and that sounds perfect to me
You got a way of dishing out that fake love
Pulling all the right strings
He won't see through you the way that I do
Till he's in too deep
Now you're somebody else's perfect
Oh, at least for a while
Till the smoke cloud clears and the real you appears
And the new guy ets how to smile
Hope you have a good life
If you don't that's alright
I won't be losing any sleep
You're somebody else's perfect
And that sounds perfect to me
Baby if it all goes wrong
Would I take you back, oh hell naw
Now you're somebody else's perfect
Oh at least for a while
Yeah,'til the smoke cloud clears and the real you appears
And the new guy ets how to smile
Hope you're having a good life
If you don't, that's alright
I won't be losing any sleep
You're somebody else's perfect and that sounds perfect to me
Somebody else is perfect
