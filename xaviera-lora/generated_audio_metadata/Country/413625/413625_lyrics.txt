He had some good times, hard times
Made it through the so-so days
Caught up on Jesus and the bad times
For the good Lord to light his way
He was a farming man working the land
It wasn't an easy life
Married young and had five kids
With a pretty little red-haired wife
He lived the life he chose
He watched his crops and family grow
When his neighbors lost their land
He was there to lend a helping hand
He had some good times, hard times
Made it through the so-so days
Call upon Jesus in the bad times
For the good Lord to light his way
Sunday morning rolls around again
Tough to get out of bed, he's got an aching head
Still he does what he's gotta do
Takes his family to church on 3rd Avenue
They might be a little bit late
He prays to God while they pass the plate
To give his family everything they need
He had some good times, hard times
Made it through the so-so days
Called upon Jesus in the bad times
For the good Lord to light his way
Well he passed away not too long ago
You know I miss that man, we were mighty close
I still see him sitting in his pickup truck
Sipping Jack Daniel's and cutting up
He lived the life he chose
He watched his crops and family grow
When his neighbors lost their land
He was there in a helping hand
He had some good times, hard times
Made it through the so-so days
Call upon Jesus in the bad times
For the good Lord to light his way
He had some good times, hard times
Made it through the social days
Called upon Jesus in the bad times
For the good Lord to light His way
Yeah, he had some good times, hard times
Made it through the so-so days
Called upon Jesus in the bad times
For the good Lord to light his way
He had some good times
