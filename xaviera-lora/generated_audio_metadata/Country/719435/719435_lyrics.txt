Sitting on top of a mountain
Watching the eagles fly
Sitting on top of a mountain
Searching for an alibi
An eager climb
No sense of time, uh huh
Sitting on top of a mountain
Hanging with a friendly squirrel
Sitting on top of a mountain
Thinking of my favorite girl
The sky is blue
Her eyes are too, uh huh
From way up here I have no fear
Mother nature speaks to me
The wind and trees puts my mind at ease
This is where I'm from
Sitting on top of a mountain
Escaping from the world below
Sitting on top of a mountain
Troubled by the life I know
The guilt I feel, this pain won't heal, uh-huh
Sitting on top of a mountain
Taking in this awesome view
Sitting on top of a mountain
It's paradise and peaceful too
The lake and hills just give me thrills, ah-ha
From way up here I have no fear
Mother nature speaks to me
The wind and trees puts my mind at ease
This is where I'm free
Sittin' on top of a mountain (mmm, oh yeah)
Sittin' on top of a mountain
Thinkin' of my favorite girl
The lake and hills just give me thrills, aha
Sitting on top of a mountain
Watching the eagles fly
