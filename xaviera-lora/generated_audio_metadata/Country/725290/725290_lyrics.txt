Don't try to change my mind
Baby I'm leaving
No I'm not the running kind
But I've run out of reason
I gave all I had and you took it all for free
And left me somewhere between love and misery
When you try to love somebody
And you get nothing but pain in return
Leaves a heart that was on fire
Slowly burn between love and misery
I don't want to feel this way
Alone and crying
But you'll always be this way (be the same)
So what's the use in trying?
We've been here before and I still can't make you see
That I can't fight this war between love and misery
When you try to love somebody
And you get nothing but pain in return
Leaves a heart that was on fire
To slowly burn
Between love and misery
No more burning it both ends
Fighting for you and me
Oh what you just can't see
Soon the flames will be ashes
Baby then you'll see
When you try to love somebody
And you get nothing but pain in return
It leaves a heart that was on fire
To slowly burn
Between love and misery
