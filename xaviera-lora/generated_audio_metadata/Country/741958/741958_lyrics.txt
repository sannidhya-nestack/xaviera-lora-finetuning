I'm ready to love you
I've waited all my life to
Just to hold you, just to kiss you
I want to only want you
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready for love
From the moment I saw you
I knew I had to have you
When I need you, when I need to
I'm reaching out to touch you
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready for love
With all this love inside me
I can let this feeling guide me
And when you stand beside me
I'm ready for love
I'm ready to love you, I'm ready for love
With all this love inside me
I can let this feeling guide me
And when you stand beside me
I'm ready for love
I'm ready to love you
I've waited all my life to
Just to touch you, just to kiss you
I want to only want you
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready for love
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready for love
I'm ready to love you, I'm ready for love
