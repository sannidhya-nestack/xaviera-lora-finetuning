And I stop and stare
I wish you could see what I see
In your numbing stare
And the way you love so tenderly
I could go all night
I don't even need to sleep
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open
I don't want to close them
And miss a single thing that you do
With my eyes wide open
I think I'm in heaven
That's how I feel when I'm with you
I can't believe
That you love me so tenderly
My only plea
Is to hold you for eternity
I'll love you all my life
And I never wanna sleep
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open
I don't want to close them
And miss a single thing that you do
With my eyes wide open
I think I'm in heaven
That's how I feel when I'm with you
Why do I need sleep?
When I live in a dream
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open (dreaming) I don't want to close them
And miss a single thing that you do
With my eyes wide open (wide open) I think I'm in heaven
That's how I feel when I'm with you
With my eyes wide open (wide open) I don't want to close them
And it's the single thing that you do with my eyes wide open
I think I'm in heaven
It's how I feel when I'm with you
