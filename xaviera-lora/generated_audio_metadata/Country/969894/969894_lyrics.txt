People say I'm lazy'cause I sleep all day and sit out all night
And they say I'm crazy'cause I play my music'til the morning light
They don't understand
That's how I make my living
So if you don't like the way I live my life
Well that's alright, that's alright
If you don't like me and what I am
Well that's alright, that's alright
'Cause I've got a dream I'm gonna keep on chasing
It's my time
I'm gonna make it playing music with my friends
Well the party never ends
that's what I call living on again
I love drinking whiskey and playing my music nice and loud
And I'll turn it up louder if they try to make me turn it down
They don't understand
That's just how I am
So if you don't like the way I live my life
Well that's alright, that's alright
If you don't like me and what I am
Well that's alright
That's alright,'cause making music with my friends
Well, the party never ends
That's what I call, that's what I call living
Oh yeah, oh here we go
Making music with my friends
Well the party never ends
That's what I call living
That's what I call living, yeah
That's what I call living, that's what I call living
That's what I call, that's what I call living baby
That's what I call living
