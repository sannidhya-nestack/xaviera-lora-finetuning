There always comes a time when there's no chance left
And there's no turning back when a line is crossed
There's always something lost or something gained
There's the beauty
There's the pain, there lies the perfect storm
A place to fall where you are safe and warm
If you don't run away, if you don't run away
If you don't run away, if you don't run away, if you don't run away, if you don't run away, if you don't run away, hey, don't run away
If I could turn back time, I'd stop the clock right now
I'd start it all again, take back the words we said
When the sun still shines, but there's still time
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
Hey, don't run away
My heart's an open book
Come closer, take a look
I've got no place to hide
There's room for you inside
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away
If you don't run away, if you don't run away, if you don't run away, hey
Turn around and stay
