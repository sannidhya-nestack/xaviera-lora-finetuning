And please please baby don't let me go
So don't turn my blue sky into black rain
My heart's gonna break just too much pain
So please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
So please please baby don't let me go
Don't turn me into just another memory
Come on girl, tell me it just ain't so
So please, don't let me go
Please, don't let me go
Love comes and love goes
Like the rising and the setting sun
But with you I laid out all my bets
Hoping we'd beat all the odds
Even saying vows before our gods
Even saying vows before the gods
Please, please baby, don't let me go
So don't turn my blue sky into black rain
My heart's gonna break, just too much pain
So please, don't let me go
Please don't let me go
Please please baby don't let me go
Don't turn me into just another memory
Come on girl tell me it just ain't so
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
Maybe you needed to escape my desire
Maybe fate has other plans for you
And I see you slipping out the door
The bed is sleeping one when it should be two
The warmth is slipping, I'm cold to my core
The warmth is slipping, I'm cold to my core
And please please baby don't let me go
So don't turn my blue sky into black rain
My heart's gonna break just too much pain
So please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
So please please baby don't let me go
Don't turn me into just another memory
Come on girl tell me it just ain't so
So please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
I should have packed up all my chips
I ot love breaks a lot of rules
But I don't know how to let you go
Couple of hearts one break such a fool
Used to be special to you now just another Joe
Used to be special to you now just another Joe
And please please baby don't let me go
So don't turn my blue sky into black rain
My heart's gonna break just too much pain
So please don't let me go
Please don't let me go
So please please baby don't let me go
Don't turn me into just another memory
Come on girl, tell me it just ain't so
Please, please, don't let me go
Please, don't let me go
Please, please baby, don't let me go
Please, don't let me go
