Don't come knockin' at my door
I won't let you in like I done before
You know how to play my hand
You're my weakness, time to take a stand
Though the tears are falling, I won't fall again
baby, this is where our love ends
Time will chase away my broken heart
And this time I'm gonna finish what you started
This time I won't play the fool
time will pass and I'll be over you
And time will chase away my broken heart
I remember when you'd call my name
And like each time before I'd run back to you
But I just can't yet give my love
To a heart of stone that won't be true
So don't you call, I won't be running back again
Girl my heart is broken, I know my heart will mend
Time will chase away my broken heart
And this time I'm gonna finish what you start
Oh no, this time I won't play the fool
This time we'll pass and I'll be over you
And time will chase away my broken heart
Time will chase away my broken heart
Oh my broken heart
