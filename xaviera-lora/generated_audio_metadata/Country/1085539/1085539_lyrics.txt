You never said a word about it
You're the one I never doubted
Ain't that just like me?
Did not feel the cold wind blowing
Yeah you really had me going some place
That I never meant to be
It's a cold bloody merry morning
On a beach in California
I pulled out your picture from the pocket of my shirt
Thought about us in San Francisco
How your love was all so legal
I took a book of matches and I slowly watched it burn
And I stood and watched the sun rise without you
In the last place on earth
I put some clothes inside a suitcase
Got out on the freeway
And I left our little town
We found the strength around Sedona
To say goodbye to Arizona
Now I drove until the road ran out
It's a cold bloody merry morning
On a beach in California
I pulled out your picture from the pocket of my shirt
Thought about us in San Francisco
How you loved Sausalito
I took a book of matches and I slowly watched it burn
And I stood and watched the sun rise without you
In the last place on earth
I ever thought I'd be not at all what I had pictured in my dreams
It's a cold bloody merry morning
On a beach in California
I pulled out your picture from the pocket of my shirt
Thought about us in San Francisco
And how you loved Sausalito
I took a book of matches and I slowly watched it burn
And I stood and watched the sun rise without you
In the last place on earth
I stood and watched the sun rise without you
In the last place on earth
