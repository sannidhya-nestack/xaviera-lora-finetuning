Well when I was young and still in school and crew cuts were the fad
I got myself a paper wrapped first job I ever had
And I saved and bought a big red bike in the western auto store
And when that school bell rang for good I was running out the door
Yeah, I ain't cut off shorts and one skinty outfit'til last I threw
Them little cretin newspapers all along the avenue
Them mother boys with whistles, they tossed'em on the lawns
But I never could quite pursue good, so I learned this yodeling song
Yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel, yodel, yodel-ay, yodel, yodel, yodel-ay, yodel, yodle, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay, yodel-ay
Well, naturally it caused a stir each time when I did this
And fighting off the Johnson's dog is something I don't miss
But every now and then someone would say, "Hey boy, don't quit"
that little yodeling song you sing will someday be hit
Well since the years are gone I wonder if they miss it all
That little yodeling paper boy whose name they can't recall
And to this day I never dreamed that this aid would come true
When folks would come from miles around to hear me yodel-ay-de-lay-de-loh
I de-de-lay-de-lay-de-loh, de-de-lay-de-lay-doh, de-de-lay-de-loh, doh, doh, doh
De-de-lay-de-lay-de, de-de-lay-de-lo, de-de-lay-de-lo-doh, de-de-lay-doh, doh, doh, doh, doh
Oh no, here comes that dog
Ah dee do de do de do de do de do de do de de do de do de do de do de do do de do de do de do de do de yodel-ay
Yodel-ay yodel-ay oh ah dee do lay
Yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel, yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel
Yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel, yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel, yodel-ay-yodel-ay-yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel
