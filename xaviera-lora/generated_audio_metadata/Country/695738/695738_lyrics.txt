I'm gonna tell you about the hardest guy I know
He's got hands like a grizzly and bones of stone
He can lay down bolts just by grabbing by the horns
Have barbed wire for breakfast and red poison
Then he is packing out the monster 18 wheels
60 ton of shiny Swedish steel
A road king ride to the animal hills
Cruising the valleys where people sing along
To the hero of the hardest we're singing this song
He's been working as a stealer working on the farm
But he's in the 18 wheeler with the broken rocks
But his heart was ticking like a bomb
Tick tack boom and he was gone
But that didn't stop him rolling on his hardcore trucking
Road train rucking
Hardcore trucking
With the Union Bank's dead son and the wood boots on
Get up every morning, working all day long
A fork in the left hand, but the Bible in the right
Rolling down the mountain and the rising sun
He's hard core trucking, road train rucking
Hardcore trucking
With the Union Bank Stetson and the wood boots on
Get up every morning working all day long
A fork in the left hand and the Bible in the right
Rolling down the mountain in the rising sun
I have told you about the toughest guy I know
With arms like a grizzly and a heart of gold
He can lay down balls just by grabbing by the horns
A swish country cowboy born to ride the road
He's hardcore trucking
Road train rocking
Hardcore trucking
The Union Bank's that song and the wood boots on
Rolling up in heaven still going strong
Elvis in the backseat and Jesus on the right
The feeling's free in heaven and the ropes don't stop
