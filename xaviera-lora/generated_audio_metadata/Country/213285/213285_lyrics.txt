Are you working in the civil service or teaching in a school
Do you take the number 66 which I followed like a fool
Down Abbey Street each night for months you were just too cool
Always playing hard to get I regret the day we met
Still I wonder, where are you now, Sheila? (Sheila!)
Where are you now, Sheila?
Maybe you met a nice guy who takes good care of you
Never tells you what to do
He would never cheat, it's true
But maybe works in a bank
If only I had the courage to try
I wouldn't be so bitter now
We never really said goodbye
Still I wonder where are you now, Sheila? (Sheila!)
Where are you now, Sheila?
I guess I found my way
You found yours in a room in Paris
We came so close
Then the next day you were gone
I'll never see you again I suppose
Unless we meet on a bus or a train
A nice big smile to see you again
And the baby cries
I examine your face
I ask for your number
But then, then
I wonder where are you now, Sheila (Sheila)
Where are you now, Sheila
Oh, what's the point? There is no point in turning back the years
What's done is done, amen
If I could only kiss you one more time
Maybe you could be mine
Again, again, again
Again
I wonder where are you now Sheila? (Sheila)
Where are you now Sheila?
Where are you now Sheila? (Sheila)
Where are you now Sheila?
Oh Sheila, Sheila
