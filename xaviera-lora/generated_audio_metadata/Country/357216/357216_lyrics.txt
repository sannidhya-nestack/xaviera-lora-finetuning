America, I dream of you
The plains on high, the seas of blue
I hear a breeze as it blows through
America
America
Clear rivers roll
With the waterfalls
Clinging to my soul
Patriot choirs
In blades of grass
America
And I am risen on the first day
My body climbs cold against the clay
And I'm whispering a new name
No, we will never be the same, America
America, where mountains rise
The moon and stars shine distant in the skies
I feel the sun warm on my face
America
America, take me back home
To my friends and family I have known
I see the flames coloring the skies
America
And I've risen on the first day
My body climbs cold against the clay
And I'm whispering a new name
No, we will never be the same, America
America, I dream of you
The plains on high, the seas are blue
I hear a breeze as it blows through
America, America
America
My country,'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Of thee I sing
My country,'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Of the I seen
