Once before you lived a solitary life
And then you took a chance, though not without a fight
You fought within yourself about which way was right
But in the end you won
You said yes to love and life
I know you feel the pain
Of losing one so dear
The first true love you knew
You shed a thousand tears
And now there are the walls
You built with your own hands
But when there is true love
No wall on earth can stand
Say yes again to love
In the darkness of your night
Say yes again to love
Say yes again to life
Say yes again to love
Let love become your life
Say yes again to love
And love will set things right
Living seems so hard
When loving we resist
There are no guarantees
Life's simple little twist
But love will heal the hurt
Dry the tears, erase the pain
There is no room for guilt
There is no one to blame
Say yes again to love
In the darkness of your night
Say yes again to love
Say yes again to life
Say yes again to love
Let love become your life
Say yes again to love
And love will set things right
Say yes again to love
In the darkness of your night
Say yes again to love
And love will set things right
