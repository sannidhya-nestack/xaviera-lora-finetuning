What if Hank Williams was alive today? Do you think a major label would sign him?
Howdy! My name's Hank Williams. I'm a singer and I write a song or two every now and then.
I'm looking for a place to record a few of my tunes. Can you help me?
The receptionist gave old Hank a blonde stare and blurted out, "Mister, do I look like I can help you?"
Before Hank had a chance to ponder the profundity of Ms. Pushbutton's witty repartee, Line 7 rang with a prophetic, pathetic, electronic timbre that jingle-jangled the heartstrings of both their souls.
And Ms. Pushbutton commenced to be moved by the impetus
Due to the fact that she needed to keep her job long enough
To pay off her new red Mustang
So she deftly maneuvered her right hand into position
And gracefully swooped down and snatched up the phone
"MGM Records, Susan speaking, how can I help you?"
Ms. Pushbutton announced, sounding a lot like the computer she played Cyberspank on at home
Hank made that little devilish laugh of his and thought to himself
How is it she can hep somebody on the phone, but she can't hep somebody standing right in front of her?
At the same time, Hank overheard Ms. Pushbutton saying,
"I'm sorry, Mr. Shalliman, he's not in his office, and I don't care if you need a new recording artist today, tomorrow, or 10 ,000 years from now.
Can I put you on?"
Now Hank had no intention of letting this golden opportunity pass him by
Like so many trucks on a lonesome highway, so he spoke up
Excuse me missy, did I hear you to say somebody is in need of a recording artist
'Cause if'n you did, I'd take it might write kindly if me, Hank Williams, could
If the good Lord's willin' and the creaks don't rise, apply for that there position right here now
When he did that little devilish laugh thing of his again
Ms. Pushbutton was taken aback yet one more time
In her personal quest to prove to the world that she was the next
Patsy, Loretta, Dolly, Reba, Shania, whatever.
Despite her inability to perform even the most insignificant task,
any better than an emotionally challenged amoeba.
But as fate would have it, and fate has it often.
Hank's heartfelt plea for artistic employment was mistaken as a dollar sign from God
And the mystical musical mogul, Mr. Shalloman, listening from his lofty perch
High above the cacophony paved paths of music rows, screamed
Susie, I don't care if you're a bitch
Send that guy over here pronto tanto
Make it snappy sappy, I'm in a hurry Murray
So get it done, hun, while the gettin's good
You got it good, ciao mamacita
And he hung up with a cosmic thud that stuck in Ms. Pushbutton's ear like a weevil
"What did you say your name was?"
Ms. Pushbutton queried with all the enthusiasm of a one-legged table dancer
"It's Hank Williams, ma'am. Happy to make your acquaintance"
And he was, even if she didn't care.
Hank was a man of the people, for the people, by the people,
a genuine pre-ramble to the very constitution of these United States of America.
Or anywhere else the original lovesick blues boy
Happened to be singing, jawing, fishing, drinking, thinking
Or just plain being the one and only one of his kind
To ever walk the face of the earth
Hankosaurus Bosephus, primeval, real people making real music for real folk
That's the heart and soul of country music, the real deal, sodium of the planet
True essence of art, religion, philosophy, social graces, southern hospitality, transcendent, transparent, transport, above and beyond.
Even beyond technology, zeitgeist, bon vivant, be happy
Ain't nothing gonna be alright, no how
So here we have this magnificent situation
That could only be orchestrated by an omnipotent conductor
And as the twangy steel guitar kicked off a song in the key of exigency
Hank was prepared to demonstrate his modest heartfelt appreciation
For Ms. Pushbutton's vainglorious attempt
To keep the squeaky wheels of Music Road rolling without rocking the bass boat on the notorious lake of life
Listen Mr. Williams, you need to get over to Acme Records ASAP
Mr. Shalliman is waiting for you, at least for the moment, until another instant opportunity knocks on his polished mahogany door and you become one more discarded product in a long line of rapidly vanishing, impulsive marketing schemes designed to increase the quarterly sales figures of CD units
Ms. Pushbutton regurgitated with all the expletive expertise of a senior CPA
Hank tried to swallow that humongous mouthful of mashed manure
But quickly realized that not even the world's most noted proctologist
Had a chance in hell of deciphering the horrendous hieroglyphics
That modern day musicotta cloaks itself in
In order to make it perfectly clear that money makes the sweetest melody on earth
When tall, lanky Hank sauntered into Acme Records
He was anxiously greeted by Mr. Shalliman's assistant, Jenny Uppity
Whose real name was Norma Jean something or other
She had the looks of twenty with the savvy of sixteen
And she proved it beyond the partially blocked incandescence of indecision
By uttering the following platitude
I hope you sing better than you look
I hope you sing real good
Hank smiled without an iota of animosity in mind
Looked Jenny Square in the eye and said
Honey, the sun is ninety-three million miles away
Can you still let it be a star?
How's about giving me a chance to shine before you go calling me otherwise?
Jenny could only reply
Please follow me Hank
They walked through the hallowed halls that lead to the pulsing heartbeat of the thriving business of country music
The clink and clank of typewriters, the instant gratification of fax machines and telephones
The celestial electronic thinking of computers, communication everywhere and not a drop to drink
The hallucination of the oasis
Camel hoofprints impressing the burning desert sand
Sheiks directing their harems inside satin tents
Palm trees dropping down coconuts to the parched ground
Someone said, "I'll do lunch if you'll do me"
And their people called their people and that led to words
And those words led to even more words
And everyone was talking but no one was listening
And the deafening silence fell like cash registers
On the pounding eardrums of the chosen few
Who will select the next big hit you may choose to endure
The gold-plated sign on the polished mahogany door read
Richard Shalliman, Vice President, Artist Development
Jenny knocked three times, she entered, Hank followed
And history rewrote itself beginning with the words
"Jenny, I told you never bring the janitor in here while I'm working !"
Barked Richard Shalliman
Uh, Richie, this is Hank Williams
He's here to see you about a deal at your request
Hank Williams, this is Richard Shalliman
I'll leave you two alone
Call me if you need me
And she vanished like last week's paycheck
I'm Richard Shalliman, VP of A &R
I can shake'em, make'em, and break'em
Before you can say my achy, breaky butt
People call me God the sequel because I'm still making stars
That other guy quit after six days
Sit down, take a load off your mind
Let me tell you what I can and cannot do for you
Hank wanted to make that little devilish laugh of his, thought better of it (never mind)
And in his own best interest proceeded to follow the misguided directions of Richard the lying hearted
"Now Hank, let's get down to it, shall we?" began VP of A &R Richard Shalliman.
"The hat works. We're in the market for a hat act.
We can grab a significant market share with that angle alone.
Maybe we'll go with black instead of white. It doesn't matter. We'll do the market research later.
But we've got to do something about your look."
You're tall and that's good but you're a little anemic looking
Maybe too mature, possibly worn out
A bit long in the tooth as it were
Are you getting this Hank?
Don't bother to respond it's all prelim stuff
Every new artist goes through it
We know our merchandise and we know our market
All you need to know is that the less you know
The easier it is to sell your soul
So we have to work on your look, get that GQ facade thing happening.
We're merchandising to teenage girls, you know, they're still buying dolls, living dolls mind you.
But if that's what it takes to sell millions and millions of those little round pieces of plastic,
then by the powers invested in me by the board of directors, by God, that's what I'll do.
Hank wasn't quite sure how to respond to that typhoonish rubbish
And he didn't have a clue what it had to do with music
Or a bunch of guys getting together on a friend's front porch
Sipping beer and eating barbecue
Picking songs that come straight from the heart
And run down through the soul like angel breath
And soothe the mind like religion and love
And brings the world closer like peace and war
Hank knew how to express himself simple and pure
True to the roots of the greatest source of all
A place where grace and beauty grows
And becomes what we dream to be
Before the light swallows up everything and makes us part of something that always is
So Hank spoke up in the only way he knew how, quick and to the point
Well, Mr. Shalliman, I can assure you I like to look my best
I wear fancy, nudie, western suits like Tex Ritter, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry
And I treat my feet to the finest leather boots the Dixon Boot Company has to offer
And I top it off with a 5X Beaver felt Stetson or Resistall, whichever is available at the time
And I ain't never had nothing but compliments about my look
Before Shalliman could interject his professional prejudice
Hank expressed his without hesitation
Let me play you a little song I wrote a while back
I think you might like it
It goes a bit like this
Hank struck an open C chord and sang
Say hey good looking
What you got cooking
But before he could finish the first line, the VP of A &R, Richard Shalliman, was frantically
waving his hands in front of Hank's astonished face and asked, "Hank?"
Are you gay?
Hank started to say, "I'm pretty happy," but
Shalliman cut him off and retract his train of thought.
It's okay if you are.
We've been looking for a viable means of garnishing a market share from that particular demographic group,
and you could be the ticket.
On the other hand, if you're not gay, you
Have to lose that obsolete idea that women do the cooking
It's politically incorrect to assume or imply that women belong in the kitchen performing domestic tasks
If you ask me, and I'll deny it if you do, women were put on earth to perform three C's
Cooking, cleaning and copulation
But you didn't hear that from me, and I've got a good lawyer if you insist on trying to prove you thought you heard me make an anti-feminist remark.
Anyway, Hank.
It's all about image. End users purchase and escape from reality.
It's our job to package our product in a way that helps them do just that.
Well, Hank, reply. It's just a song. You either like it or you don't.
I ain't trying to tell nobody to do nothing.
You couldn't be any more wrong if you tried twice as hard, Shalliman quickly retorted
As a country music superstar, you are a role model to millions of adoring fans
And I daresay you are responsible to them and accountable to us
You have to be what they expect you to be and we demand you to be
Nothing less is acceptable to either party
Hank maintained his cool southern optimism without missing a beat when he said, "All right, maybe you don't like that one, but how about this?"
I just told Mama goodbye Mother's Day
But once again, before he could finish the first line, as Shalliman symbolically banged a gong by uttering the words, "No, no, no, that just won't do"
Do you have anything more positive, more upbeat?
Nobody wants to be stuck in rush hour traffic at 7am
And have to listen to a complete downer about somebody's mother dying
Give me something about a truck or something you can line dance to
Be happy, be sappy, be crappy for all I care
But don't make me think about death before I've had my second cup of coffee
Now Hank was a tad befuddled, but not discouraged
He'd dealt with domineering people all his lonely life
So he did what he did best and broke into another tune
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Lord, my bucket's got a hole in it
Once again, Hank suffered the sting of songus interruptus
At that point, Shalloman leaped over his teak desk
And landed smack dab in front of the country crooner
Simultaneously and adroitly applying his right hand across Hank's partially agape satchmo
Like duct tape on a kidnapped spy
And began pontificating from the pulpit of his blessed kingdom
Like a preacher in front of a TV camera
First of all, unless you're Anheuser-Busch
You can't sing songs that glorify the use of alcoholic beverages
Hank sheepishly mentioned that he could change it to milk
And Shalliman momentarily considered the possibility
Of a thirty-second commercial spot for the National Dairy Association
But quickly dismissed the idea
Based on a negative investment return analysis
He instantaneously performed in his calculator-fortified head
So he continued his tirade
Secondly, nobody wants to hear a song about a bucket
You might as well write one about a wooden Indian
Give me another strawberry wine, now there's a great song
You know Hank, maybe you're too country
Hank scratched his head before he gently removed Shalliman's sweaty hand from his quivering mouth and said, "You might be right about the wooden Indian, but I fail to see the difference between my beer and your wine except in the bottles they come in."
"Oh, it's much more complicated than that," Shalliman nervously explained, his nose swelling up ever so slightly.
Hank, you have to understand
This is no longer the music business
It's the business of music
We have big rents to pay, stockholders to answer to
And public opinion to keep us from doing what we'd really like to do
We enter the game with one shaky hand tied behind our backs
So when a young greenhorn, tin horn, highfalutin hillbilly redneck cowboy
Bad boy, snot nose son of a bitch comes knockin' on our polished mahogany door
He better get one thing straight right
