He served his country back in Vietnam, a hero among men
They sent him home with a chest full of medals and taught him how to walk again
He built his house with his own two hands
On a corner lot bought on a V .A. plan
He married my mama, now here I am
And I'm proud to say
He's a good old boy who loved darn hard
Got a redneck and a purple heart
He flies old glory out in his front yard
Each and every day
He loves his wife and he's proud of his kids
He's working two jobs with no regrets
He sleeps well knowing that he's done his best
I'm his biggest fan, yeah, that's my old man
Growing up he taught me right from wrong
Thank God he took the time
And we both knew if that leather belt hung
If I got out of line
He said there's nothing like an honest week's work
A good day of fishing and some Sunday church
If a neighbor was in need he was always first to lend a helping hand
He's a good old boy who loved Earnhardt
Got a redneck and a purple heart
He flies old glory out in his front yard each and every day
He loves his wife and is proud of his kids
He's working two jobs with no regrets
He sleeps well knowing that he's done his best
I'm his biggest fan, yeah, that's my old man
I overheard my son and his best friend Drew
Bragging on their daddies like young boys do
He's so glad I'm back
From this war in Iraq
Yeah, I'm a good old boy who loved Earnhardt
Got a redneck and his purple heart
And a flyhole chlorine in my front yard
Each and every day
Whoa, I love my wife and I'm proud of my kids
I'm working two jobs with no regrets
I sleep well knowing that I've done my best
Someday he'll understand just how proud I am
I'm his old man
