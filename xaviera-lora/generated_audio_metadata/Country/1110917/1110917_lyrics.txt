Days slip by in the blink of an eye
Can't stop'em if you wanted to
Gotta make'em count
Don't wanna go out with a bucket list we didn't do
So let's make Vegas by midnight
Tie back, star dust
Soak up the moonshine for a while
And down on up, drink it in every drop
Only get one shot, they try to ride the wind
A head cup of life, get us some
Let's live it up, chase it'til the bitter end
this world ain't slowing down
And we only got right now to drink it in every drop
One shot
Drink it in, yeah
Won't keep track, no we don't need a map
We'll just hit the road
Tomorrow call the boss, tell him we got lost
Somewhere down in Mexico
Wildfire, sunrise, sea breeze, you and me
Drunk on the good times, sweeter than whiskey
Drink it in every drop, only get one shot
Tryna ride the wind
Yeah, a couple of bitter songs
Let's live it up, chase it to the bitter end
this world ain't slowing down
And we only got right now to drink it in
Every drop, one shot, drink it in, yeah
No regrets, no holding back, not this time
Turn it up, let's go, let's roll and just enjoy the ride
Drink it in every drop, only get one shot to try to ride the wind
Cup of life, give it some
Let's live it up, chase it to the bitter end
this world ain't slowing down
And we only got right now to drink it in
Every drop, one shot, drink it in, yeah
Every drop, one shot, drink it in
Drink it in, yeah, drink it in, yeah, drink it in, yeah
