Do you believe in miracles
They can happen in your life
Cause once there was a miracle
A miracle on ice
A miracle on ice
Was like when David faced Goliath
For Brookes U .S. hockey team
To beat the mighty Russian bear
Then go on for gold, a dream
Masuda sound like thunder
From a tiny upstate town
Became a US cry of victory
Heard the whole world around
Do you believe in miracles
Can happen in your life
Yes once there was a miracle
A miracle on ice
Ooh
The flag wrapped'round Greg's shoulders
Searched the crowd to find his dad
Captain Mike Garuzioni
Waving teammates to the stand
Yes, sometimes there are moments
That words cannot explain
That join us all together
In the winning of the game
Do you believe in miracles?
They can happen in your life
once there was a miracle
A miracle on ice
Yes once there was a miracle
A miracle on ice
