Well I straightened up the attic
Finally cleaned up all that mess
Swept the cobwebs from the ceiling
And made up all the beds
Finally washed the dishes
And I vacuumed up the floor
I got my house in order and you walked right out the door
Well I threw out all the garbage that we had left around
Got rid of all the beer cans we acquired by the pound
I got a good redemption down at the local store
I got my house in order and you'll walk right out the door
I got my house in order I'm feeling good as new
But every empty room still holds a memory of you
I guess you liked the house a mess, this I'm really sure
when I got my house in order, you walked right out the door
Well, I've finished all the garden
It's amazing, but it's true
When I paint the walls and shutters
There'll be one more job to do
Take our wedding picture and I'll throw it in a drawer
I got my house in order and you'll walk right out the door
I got my house in order, I'm feeling good as new
But every empty room still holds the memory of you
I guess you like the house a mess, this I can be sure
when I got my house in order
You walked right out the door
When I got my house in order
Hell, you walked right out the door
