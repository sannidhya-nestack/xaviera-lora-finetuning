You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
So tired of being lonely
Know I'm not the only one
Who thinks they need a change
When it's all gonna stay the same
What you did to me
The memories were wasted on I'm done
I'm done waiting on you
I'm gonna drink this whiskey down
Stop waiting on the sound of you coming home
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
A little too late baby, the day turns to night
You've been wanting me to stay lately, all you'll see is my tail lights
No matter who is wrong, we're moving on
It's what I have to do to stop missing you one day
I'm done waiting on you
I'm gonna drink this whiskey down
And stop waiting on the sound of you coming home
you're not coming home
I cannot get it through my head
You don't care about me
You never, you never did, I'm dead
I'm done, I'm done waiting on you
Come and drink this whiskey down
Stop waiting on the sound of you coming home
Oh, I'm done
I'm dead, I'm dead on you
Gonna drink this whiskey down
At some point on the sound of you coming home
You're not coming home (You're not coming home, baby)
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
You're not coming home, baby
You're not coming home
