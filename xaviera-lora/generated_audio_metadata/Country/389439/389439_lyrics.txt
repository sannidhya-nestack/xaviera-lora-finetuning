It's really such a pity, I don't want you anymore
Never thought that it would end this way
You were never listening, all the times I slammed the door
Just closed your eyes and drank the pain away
You're the kind of guy who tried to run and hide
Somewhere deep inside somehow you lost your pride
And even an honest man turns to liar
When the bottle has you dangling
Dangling over fire
I was always looking up to you
I thought you were a king
It's taken me so long to realize
Your golden crown was nothing
But a painted piece of tin
You're not the man you once were in my eyes
You're the kinda guy who tried to run and hide
Somewhere deep inside somehow you lost your pride
And even an honest man turns to liar
When the bottle has you dangling
When the bottle has you dangling
Dangling over fire
I just always wanted
The kind of love you could not give
You tease me with a touch, I took the bait
And like some damned old fisherman
You trapped me in your net
And now for me iving is too late
You're the kind of guy who tried to run and hide
Somewhere deep inside somehow you lost your pride
And even an honest man turns to liar
When the bottle has you dangling
When the bottle has you dangling
Dangling over fire, over fire, over fire
