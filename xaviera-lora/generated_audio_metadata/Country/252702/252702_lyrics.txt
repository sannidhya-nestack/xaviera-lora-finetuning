Sitting there right where you are
Cause the road to home is just too hard
From your wishing chair sign complain
And if you don't stand up you're gonna stay that way
Where you live and it's your home
It's not a fortress, it's not a dome
Out tucked in, don't you feel so safe
if you don't stand up
It won't stay that way
What's it gonna take for you
To do the thing you need to do
Step outside and take a look around
You're the one who shouts and shrugs
Argues with the one-eyed bug
If no one hears you, do you make a sound?
You wanna know
And it's ain't loose,'cause if they come for me, they'll come for you
Bound with lies and glued in place, and if you don't stand up
It's gonna stay that way
Who you love and where you go
How they get the things they know
If you don't decide then you decide it all
What's it gonna take for you to do the thing you need to do
Blessed are the ones who get involved
You're sitting there and waiting while
the road to home
It's just too hard from the wishing chair side
You complain, and if you don't stand up, you're gonna stay that way
Well if you don't stand up, it's gonna stay that way
