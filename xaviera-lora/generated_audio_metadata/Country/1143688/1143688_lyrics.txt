It's now or never
We should be together
Tired of waiting
Anticipating by the phone
Hey yeah (hey yeah)
Really wants to be alone
Hey yeah (yeah)
Oh my, my baby
And it's cold, sedating
Sure brings my temperature down
All this waiting
When will you come around? Hey yeah
Hey yeah
When will the lost be found, left behind? Hey yeah
Oh my, my baby
Still when we talk
We talk way too long
When we sing
We're singing the same song, hey yeah
When will you come around, hey yeah
Set my feet on higher ground, hey yeah
Oh my, my baby
Can't you see it's now or never
If we should be together
Tired of waiting
Can't spend my life all alone
Anticipating
Grafted to this phone
Hey yeah (hey yeah)
Do you really wanna be alone
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
When we could be together
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Alone together yeah
Hey yeah
Hey hey hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey hey hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
