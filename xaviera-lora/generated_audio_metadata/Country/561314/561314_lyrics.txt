You can turn on the news any time of day
And listen to the people tell you what you'd pay at the pump
And they wonder if it's ever gonna stop
The media folks, they got it all figured out through their big white teeth
They'll tell you all about what it's like living in these hard times
And what's it like to wake up in the morning and not have a job
And without a warning they'll come along and kick you out in the street
And what's it like to stand in line at the welfare office with your last two dimes
Yeah, what's it like living in these hard times?
Well, they're great big experts with great big cars
Riding around like they're great big stars
Just'cause they read the numbers on the unemployment line
If they would shut the hell up once in a while
All up and down the TV dial about what it's like living in these hard times
And what's it like to have nothing to lose
When the bank keeps calling to give you the news
That they're gonna have to change the locks on your door
And what's it like to feel like a joke
When you're in so deep you're beginning to choke
Yeah what's it like living in these hard times
Yeah, what's it like to be working class
And what's it like to get kicked in the ass
Yeah, what's it like living in these hard times
Yeah, what's it like living in these hard times
Yeah, what's it like living in these hard times
