My mama always said if you love something, set it free
Now I don't understand her logic just between you and me
She said if it comes back it was meant to be
Oh baby why don't you come back to me
I'm holding, I'm dreaming, and I'm waiting
I'm hoping it'll get better, giving a little time
But all I'm doing is dreaming of holding you tight
Up all night waiting for your call
Baby you're making me climb the walls
I'm hoping, dreaming, and I'm waiting
Mama said what's worth having is worth waiting for
I guess I can wait forever if you'll come back for sure
Living alone makes me miss you more
Oh baby come walking back through my door
I'm hoping, I'm dreaming, and I'm waiting
I'm hoping it'll get better, giving a little time
But all I'm doing is dreaming of holding you tight
Up all night waiting for your call
Baby you're making me climb the walls
I'm hoping, I'm dreaming, and I'm waiting
I'm hoping it'll get better giving a little time
But all I'm doing is dreaming of holding you tight
Up all night waiting for your call
Baby you're making me climb the walls
I'm hoping, I'm dreaming, and I'm waiting
Oh I'm hoping, I'm dreaming, and I "m waiting
Lord I'm hoping, I'm dreaming, and I waiting
