There's an ice storm getting close they say
You better get on in
This cold don't look like it will subside
Lock your windows latch the door behind
It creeps inside of me
Gets into your bones, into your mind
Ice storms, quiet storms, crackin' hearts in two
Ice storms don't warn, look out for me
You can see it through the winter pains
When they leave the shades undrawn
They didn't see it shoot'til it came on
As she sits there staring silently
While she hides away upstairs
They wonder if they ever even cared
Ice storms, quiet storms, cracking hearts in two
Ice storms don't warn of California and you
Pull the covers over, babe, we're gonna keep us warm
Stay beside and we'll be fine, we can fight the storm
We can fight the storm
Ice storms, fire storms, cracking hearts in two
Ice storms don't warn, the California you
The California you
