It was a hot summer night way down in Memphis, Tennessee
We were heading down to Graceland for the silver anniversary
You were holding back your tears thinking about what might have been
I was thinking how the wise men say only fools rush in
It was a mighty fine tour, you said you liked the jungle room best
We were standing in the garden where they laid the king to rest
I said pardon me for asking, I was wondering if you might
Tell me little darling, are you lonesome tonight
Hey, let me be your Elvis baby
Come on and say you will
I got a brand new pair of blue sweat shoes
I got a'57 Coupe Deville
You know it's now or never
You got me on sugar
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on be my little buttercup
Well now we could go dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel
We could head on down to Beale Street have a drink and rest a little bit of hell
Go walk along the river don't you think we'd make a beautiful pair
Come on little darling let me be your teddy bear
That's right now baby, come on
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on and say you will
I got a brand new pair of blue sweat shoes
I got a'57 Coupe Deville
You know it's now or never
You got me on sugar
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on be my little buttercup
Now we could have some ribs at the rendezvous
Tour some studio and when we're through
You can stamp this heart of mine and return to sender
Or we'll spend the night talking about love, Mitch Hender
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on and say you will
I got a brand new pair of blue sweat shoes
I got a'57 coupe duvet
You know it's now or never
You got me on sugar
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on be my little buttercup
Let me be your Elvis baby
Come on be my little buttercup
