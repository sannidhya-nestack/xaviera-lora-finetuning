Never thought I'd see the lights in Nashville
Never thought I'd leave my old hometown
Never thought I'd ever do more than play a little coffeehouse
Or lead the Sunday morning worship crowd
I never thought I'd see that grand old Opry
Or hear the stories that Ryman's walls could tell
Look I never thought I'd ever live to see the day I'd play anything but rock and roll
But with the way new country rocks it's hard to tell
There's a road that leads you to a life you'd never dream
So here I am, I'm gonna take this town by storm
Here I am, for this moment I was born
And here I am, and I'm not going away
Here I am, and I'm here to stay
Never thought I'd see through all the darkness
Never thought I'd see the light of day
Look, I never thought I'd ever live to see the day I turn 21
Let alone the life I have today
I never thought I'd find the path to freedom
Never thought I'd find the road I'm on
I never thought I'd ever escape those reckless wonder years
Yeah by all rights I should be gone
But there's a road that leads to free the captive life you lead
So here I am
I'm gonna take this life by storm
Here I am
For this moment I was born
And here I am
And I'm not going away
Here I am
With all the hope and faith that this old town can bring
To everyone who loves to sing
And all the power it's thought to hold will grant your dreams
It doesn't hold a candle to the one who set me free
By saying here I am
I'm gonna take this crown of thorns
Here I am
For this moment I was born
Here I am
And though I have to go away
Here I am
And I'm here to stay
