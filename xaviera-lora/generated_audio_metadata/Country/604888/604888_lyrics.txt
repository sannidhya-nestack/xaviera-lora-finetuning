Don't tell me your heart is breaking
Just because my heart is already taken
You're taking love too seriously
Get a grip on reality
Look me up in your stream
We can talk'til dawn
No, there ain't nothing wrong
It's innocent child's play
We know what happens every day
You gotta read my mind
Before you cross that line
If you take my advice
Stay on your own side
Don't tell me your heart is breaking
Just because my heart is already taken
You're taking love too seriously
Get a grip on reality
Look me up in your net stream
Someday you'll wake up
Next to the girl of your dreams
You're taking love too seriously
Get a grip on reality
Look me up in your next dream
Oh look me up
In your next dream
