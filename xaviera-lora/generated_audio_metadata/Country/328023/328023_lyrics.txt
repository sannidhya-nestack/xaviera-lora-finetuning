As I walked up 42nd Street, I met Sergeant Barry Mann
He asked me for a handout, reached out his only hand
I bought a Big Mac, super sized, gave him ten bucks for the road
It's hard to see his payment for
The freedom that he sold
We're all just fallen angels
Trying to find a place to land
Gotta put a hand out
And open it up
So I can touch my fellow man
We can tote that barge together
Better with a friend than to be alone
It's enough to care about someone you don't know
I rode the F train across town
Saw the tears in a young girl's face
Seven months along
A baby on the way
That daddy took a one way trip
Her family cut her loose
I put her up in a Motown six
So she could figure what to do
We're all just fallen angels
Trying to find a place to land
Gotta put a hand out
Hand open it up
So I can touch my fellow man
We can tote that barge together better with a friend than to be alone
It's enough to care about someone you don't know
I don't need a million bucks to win the lottery
The thing that makes a difference
Are people just like you and me
We're all just fallen angels
Trying to find a place to land
Gotta put a hand out and open it up
So I can touch my fellow man
We can tote that barge together better with a friend than to be alone
It's enough to care about someone you don't know
We're all just fallen angels
Trying to find a place to land
