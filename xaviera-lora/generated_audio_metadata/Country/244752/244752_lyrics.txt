I'm gonna dance all night in my new shoes
After a long week of paying too many dues
Rock and roll the country and maybe even blues
Well I'm moving all night in my dancing shoes
Oh baby, get your high heel shoes
And that red dress on
And I don't want no excuse
You got ten minutes or I'll be gone
I'm tired of sitting around
Make you an offer you can't refuse
I'm gonna dance all night in my new shoes
After a week of paying too many dues
Rock and roll, country, maybe even blues
Well I'm scuffing these floors in my new shoes
That's right
Baby you know I bought these new shiny pair of shoes
Cause they were tapping on their own
And I'm dying to try them out, I ain't dancing all alone
So let's go, faster we go, the sooner we'll be out
Oh, come on now girl, I'm gonna dance all night, my new shoes
After a long week, paying too many dues, rock and roll the country
Maybe even some blues
I'm moving all night in my dancing shoes
Come on now
Baby, see the rhythm of the lights
Feel the energy on the floor
The crowds all yell for a whole lot more, oh
That red dress looking real tight
I'm not thinking'bout another day
Just want this moment to always stay
Oh baby I knew that you couldn't refuse
Up and down the strip
Oh we're gonna cruise
There's nothing like dancing
To make a spirit soar
When you're done
I still want more
More, more, more
I'm gonna dance all night
My new shoes
After a long week of paying too many dues
Rock and roll the country, maybe even blues
I'm shuffling along, I got no curfews
Well I'm scuffing these floors in my new shoes
Well I'm moving all night in my dancing shoes
