I remember mama told me
One day boy you're gonna meet her
She will make you happy for the rest of your life
Like a lightning bolt it happened right before my blinded eyes
Was that my voice asking do you want to be my wife?
You are what you are
And you got what you've got (you got it)
And when you do the things you do I like it a lot
Every time you let me touch you
Every thought that fills my head
Everywhere you take me I'm right there by your side
You are what you are, you've got what you've got
When you do the things you do, I like it a lot
Mama knew the man in me would need the woman in you
You are what you are (you are what you are)
You got what you got (you got it)
When you do the things you do, I like it a lot (a lot)
I like it
I like it
I like it a lot
I like it a lot
