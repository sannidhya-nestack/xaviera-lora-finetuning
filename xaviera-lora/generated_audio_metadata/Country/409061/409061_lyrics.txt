Ooh
Big city fame don't let me down
Don't you change the girl who came from this small town
Take this makeup off
Put these blue jeans on
They can think what they want
I never thought I'd get this far
Oh but I did
The whole world thinks that I'm a star
But that's not how I live
I'm in every magazine
They all think that they know me
I'm not the girl that you see on stage
I've never been to LA
Ooh
They call me wild but I don't care
Don't care what they say
Seein' places when I'm not even there
I turn the TV off
Put some country on
Let them think what they want
I never thought I'd get this far
Oh, but I did
The whole world thinks that I'm a star
But that's not how I live
I'm in every magazine
They all think that they know me
I'm not the girl that you see on stage
I've never been to LA
I'm not the girl that you see on stage
Never been to LA
I've never been to LA
