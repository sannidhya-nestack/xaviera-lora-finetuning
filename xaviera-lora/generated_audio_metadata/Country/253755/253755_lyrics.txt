One for the money, two for the show
My baby left me for some fella in the rodeo
She broke my heart and busted my pride
She said she'd never fall for any other guy
I know it's wrong to seek revenge
That ain't no way to treat your friends
If wishes were horses, ride you out of town
To the prairie dog oasis, back to the holy ground
If wishes were horses, ride you out of town
Little Billy I'd ride you'til you break a leg
So I could put you down
There goes my angel, my buttercup
She left me for some cowboys, said he had a little more giddyup
She broke my spirit, and busted my stride
So I want eight more seconds, I want one last ride
I know it's wrong to seek revenge
That ain't no way to treat your friends
If wishes were horses, ride you out of town
Take the prairie dog away, he's sis, back to the holy ground
If wishes were horses, ride you out of town
Little filly, I'd ride you'til you break a leg
So I could put you down
Pick it up
If wishes were horses, I'd ride you out of town
For the baby dog oasis, back to the holy ground
If wishes were horses, I'd ride you out town
Little filly, I'd ride you'til you break a leg
So I could put you down
If wishes were horses, wishes were horses
We she's were horses
If we go riding out of town
And you break your leg
I will put you down
If we go riding out of town
And you break your leg
