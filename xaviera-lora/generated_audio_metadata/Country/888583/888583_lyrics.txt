When you left you took my heart
There's something you ot
You left it on the floor
I hung it by the door
Sometimes I must admit
Even though it doesn't fit
I wear it in a sleep
So I can hold you in my dreams
You left
Left your jacket lying on the floor of my rusted ruby red topboard
It's so pathetic, I can't get away from this memory
There is no escape, it's my straight jacket
Straight jacket
The suede is real smooth, not a bit like you
Pocket has cigarettes, menthol I thought you quit
Guess you had better luck, better luck quitting us
Maybe in a month or two, I'll get around to quitting you
You left your jacket lying on the floor
On my rusted ruby red topboard
It's so pathetic
I can't get away from this memory
There is no escape
It's my straight jacket
If you want it
Better get it
I might give it away
It cut me so deep when you left me
At least I know, not like you, the scar will stay
You left your jagged line on the floor of my rusted roof
Ruby rag top board, it's so pathetic
I can't get away from this memory
There is no escape
You left your jacket lying on the floor
I'm arrested
Ruby rag top board, it's so pathetic
I can't get away from this memory
There is no escape
It's my straight jacket
Straight jackets
Rusted ruby red topboard
