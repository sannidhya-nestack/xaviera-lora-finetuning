Wore down a hundred pencils
Broke a thousand guitar strings
I thought I wrote the world's best song
At least two times a week
If I could hear them playing
In my car on the radio
Well I'd be signing autographs everywhere I go
I want the next big hit
A video on CMT
A high count starter game
And my Grammy on national TV
I wouldn't mind a mansion
Or a luxury jet
All I really want is the next big hit
All I really want is the next big hit
I walk the streets of Nashville, New York, and L .A.
I've been in every studio recording the songs I play
If I could have one meeting with Sony or BMG
Well, I'd be leading the revival of the country music industry
I want the next big hit, a video on CMT
A hot young star to give me my Grammy on national TV
I wouldn't mind a mansion or a luxury jet
All I really want is the next big hit
All I really want is the next big hit
Sitting on my back porch hanging with my friends
Playing all the songs I love
Dreaming dreams that never end
I want the next big hit
A video on CMT
A hot young star to give me my Grammy on national TV
I wouldn't mind a mansion
Or a luxury jet
All I really want
Is the next big hit
All I really want is the next big hit
