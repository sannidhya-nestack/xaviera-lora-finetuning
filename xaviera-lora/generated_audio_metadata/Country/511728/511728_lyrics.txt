The clock is on, it's race for time
She's running barrels in the show tonight, she's all cinched up
To win that buckle in the case tonight
This girl is gonna take first place
Cowgirl up and cowgirl down
She's gonna ride this circuit, ride it out of town
She'll let loose on them brakes, away those who's will go
Freedom in the wind
Cowgirl up takes it home
She made her first pass
Two more barrels to go
She's counting them down
Kicking them spurs, you know
She's gonna score sixteen
Coming round that bend
Hanging on for the ride
Oh, it ain't over yet
Cowgirl up
And the cowgirl down
She's gonna ride this circuit
Ride it out town
She'll let loose on them reins
Away those tools will go
Freedom
I'm in the wind
Yeah girl love takes it home
The clock is on, it's a race for time
She's running barrels in the show tonight
She's all cinched up
To win that buckle in the case tonight
This girl is gonna take first place
Cowgirl up and cowgirl down
She's gonna ride this circuit, ride it out of town
She'll let loose all them reins, away those shoes will go
Freedom in the wind
Cowgirl love takes it home
Cowgirl love takes it home
Cowgirl love takes it home
