Streaking through the black night
Slipping through the towns
Click clacking in a rhythm
With a bayonet and hounds
Over in the diner
Sits a headless chap
And tries to scratch his forehead
And tries to find his hat
He's riding on a ghost train
Yeah, a ghost train
Through the night
He's riding on a ghost train, yeah, ghost train through the night
The cars are full of riders, none of them alive
Not knowing where they're going or what time they'll arrive
It's a real collection of the darkest souls
Thieves, killers and mad men
From the blackest holes they're riding on a ghost train
Yeah, a ghost train through the night
They're riding on a ghost train
Yeah, a ghost train through the night
These passengers all got their baggage
The kind they'd like to drop
And though there's lots of stations
This train, it'll never stop
My wife's in the sleeper
Hatchet by his side
Jim's playing with fire
Looking kinda fried
Billy the outlaw
He's got his pistol cocked
And wants to shoot his way out
But the exits are blocked
He's riding on a ghost train
Yeah, a ghost train through the night
He's riding on a ghost train, ghost train through the night
He's riding on a ghost train, ghost train through the night
He's riding on a ghost train, ghost train through the night
