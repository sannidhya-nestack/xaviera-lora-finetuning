Can you tell me what it takes
To get escorted from this place
I'll clean out my desk with a smile across my face
Oh yeah
I can't work another day
I need a permanent getaway
I'm on a conference call but my mind is miles away
At the beach
I don't want your company car
I wanna move my office down to the bar
I hope I get fired'cause I ain't a quitter
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
The daily grind has fried my mind
And I've gotta leave this life behind
So I wanna get canned'cause I'm going crazy
I'm not a loser and I'm not lazy
But man this place can be so dull
So I'm gonna burn this cubicle cause
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
Hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
I always come in late
And make my way home early
I hate my boss and I know that he is surely
Tired of me
Tell payroll to mail my check
I'll be sipping a cold one out on the deck
I hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
The daily grind has fried my mind
So I've gotta leave this life behind
And I hope I get canned
Cause I'm going crazy
I'm not a loser and I'm not lazy
But man this place can be so dull
So I'm gonna burn this cubicle cause
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
Hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
Wish they'd hand me a pink slip
Or throw me under the bus
Maybe one day I'll get the axe, I promise
I won't make a fuss
I hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
The daily grind has fried my mind
So I've gotta leave this life behind and
I hope I get canned cause I'm going crazy
I'm not a loser and I'm not lazy
But man this place can be so dull
So I'm gonna burn my cubicle cows
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
Hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
I'm getting old and I'm getting bitter
Hope I get fired cause I ain't a quitter
