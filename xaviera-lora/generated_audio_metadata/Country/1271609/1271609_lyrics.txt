Standing on the platform, got a ticket in my hand
Another small town girl, with big city plans
I need a fast train, to carry me away
Yeah, fast train, I'm gonna make it someday
Don't have much money, just a ten dollar bill
But if I don't leave this town today
I guess I never will, I need a fast train
To carry me away
Yeah, a fast train
I'm gonna make it someday
I wonder how I healed her life staying out late
Champagne in my glass, seafood on my plate
Dancing'neath the bright lights, kicking off my shoes
Got my head held high, nothing to lose
Rockin' to the country, rollin' down the line
I got my mind made up, and I'm runnin' out of time
I need a fast train to carry me away
Yeah, a fast train, I'm gonna make it from the day
Well, I know that life is short and we're just passing through
Get out of my way, I got things I wanna do
I'm dreaming of a Brad Pitt hanging off my arm
Got a hillbilly barber trying to keep me on the phone
Riding on the fast train rolling down the track
I hear the diesel humming and never coming back on the fast train
It carries me away
Yeah the fast train
I'm gonna make it someday
Yeah the fast train
I'm gonna make it someday
If I'm straight, I'm gonna make it someday
