I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Just can't wait to see you again
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Can't wait to see you and my friends
You can feel it in the air
There's magic everywhere
And everybody's feeling fine
It's that special time of year
To show you really care
So glad it's Christmas time
The lights are shining bright
It lightened up the night
Excitement is in the children's eyes
As they walk around the streets
They smile as they meet
Everyone passing by
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Just can't wait to see you again
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Can't wait to see you and my friends
The sound of Christmas carols ring out in the air
And Santa is looking so fine
Lots of Christmas presents around the tree
So glad it's Christmas time
You can feel it in the air
There's magic everywhere
And everybody's feeling fine
It's that special time of year
To show you really care
So glad it's Christmas time
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Just can't wait to see you again
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Can't wait to see you and my friends
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Just can't wait to see you again
I'll be back in Nashville for Christmas
Can't wait to see you and my friends
Can't wait to see you and my friends
Can't wait to see you and my friends
