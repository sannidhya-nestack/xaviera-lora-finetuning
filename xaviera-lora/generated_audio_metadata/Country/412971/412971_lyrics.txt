You're walking and talking in my sleep again
Just when I thought your memory would end
In dreams you whisper words of love as we stroll hand in hand
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
My daydreams weren't always about you
My sleepless nights had dwindled down to just a few
I was learning to be without you in my life
Till you walked by, now you're running through my mind
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
Just when I thought your memory would end
In dreams you whisper words of love as we stroll hand in hand
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
I barely remember how warm your lips could be
I'd almost otten how you made sweet love to me
Just when I thought your memory would end
You started walking and talking in my sleep again
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
Just when I thought your memory would end
In dreams you whisper words of love as we stroll hand in hand
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
You're walking and talking in my sleep again
