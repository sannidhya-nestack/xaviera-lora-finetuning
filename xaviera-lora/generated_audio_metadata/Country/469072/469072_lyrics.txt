Whole lot
I was driving last summer alone in my car
One night down a bumpy road
It was getting pretty late and I saw up ahead
A truck with a heavy load
Well, the trucker pulled up, a woman ran out
And I nearly died of fright
As she walked in my car
Looked me in the eye and said
Can I hitch a ride?
She was sexy and slim, I said yeah, come on in
She said she was not used to hiking
Come on dear, she said, let's get out of here
I think you're a highway Viking
You're a highway viking
Took to the highway this girl I picked up
She was sure looking alright
Just left her boyfriend
She told me what happened in the truck that night
Oh, I said, where are you headed?
I could take you there
I really don't mind, she said
I think you're my kind, yeah
She was sexy and slim, I said yeah
But come on in, she said
She was not used to hiking, ooh
Come on dear, she said
Let's get out of here
'Cause I think you're a highway biking
You're a highway biking
She was sexy and slim
I said yeah, come on in
She said she was not used to hiking, yeah
She changed my whole life
Now she is my wife, yeah
Yeah, she calls me her highway biking, yeah
Yeah she calls me her highway viking
Yeah she calls me her highway viking
Her highway viking
