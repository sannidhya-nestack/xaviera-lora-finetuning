It was fun pretending happy endings
Once upon a time
I loved fairy tales, wishing wells, and magic carpet rides
The scarecrow, tin man, the lion and me
Followed the yellow brick road
I discovered the real world
Had magic of its own
Somewhere under the rainbow
Two hearts touched
One kiss they couldn't say no
They fell in love
They made a wish upon a star
And it came true I know
I was there and we're still here
Somewhere under the rainbow
Once I had to fly above the sky
To hear bluebirds sing
Now I don't need magic wings
To take me there again
They lived happily ever after
Is how this story goes
This is better than make believe
There's no place like home
Somewhere under the rainbow
Two hearts touched
One kiss they couldn't say no
They fell in love
They made a wish upon a star
And it came true I know
I was there and you're still here
Somewhere under the rainbow
Somewhere under the rainbow
Somewhere under the rainbow
Somewhere under the rainbow
