Long haul, gotta hit the road, up against a fast clock
Carrying a heavy load, eighteen wheels that sure can rock
So many places to go, with an angel by my side
Tuned into the radio, cross the country we will glide
Trust ECB by my side
Roads can be full of surprises
Sometimes my sail up and dies
But I'm there before the moon rises
The country always relies
On me and other grunt guys
Drivers like no others
Hats off to the truckers
Hats off to the truckers
I'm not so quick to find fault
We deliver goods each day
Without us the country halts
We're icons on the highway
My rig's like a carpet ride
Day or night, in rain or shine
I do my job with great pride
Truckin' to the finish line
Trust ECB by my side
Roads can be full of surprises
Sometimes my sail up and dies
But I'm there before the moon rises
The country always relies
On me and other grunt guys
Drivers like no others
Hats off to the truckers
Truckers help the country survive, short and long haul drivers
So let's hear it for'em
Hats off to the truckers
Over and out
