I ordered one more drink just to watch her walk away
When she came back she accidentally dropped her tray
When she bent over I stared till I went blind
She slapped my face and I said wait I could tell you why
You got a great ass
There ain't no doubt about it
You got a great ass
Well here's looking at it
I wiped the grin from my face
Shook the beer off my jeans
I asked her if she'd turn around and shed some light on me
Somewhere back in your past
There must be a clue
Who would dare to give that derriere to you
You got a great ass
There ain't no doubt about it
You got a great ass
Well here's looking at it
And all I want to do is take a look at you
And earn more admiration for your natural beauty
And take the opportunity to tell you what you're doing to me
When it was time to leave, well I left her a big tip
I wrote across a C note, I want you to know this
I hope you're not offended by the way I look at you
I'm just showing my appreciation for the eous view
He got a great ass
There ain't no doubt about it
You got a great ass
Well here's looking at it
Well I'm looking at it
You know I'm looking at it
