I bought a red Corvette to drive you out of my mind
I couldn't put enough miles between you and goodbye
The further I go the closer you are
You're long gone but not from my heart
Enjoy the ride honey I can't leave you behind
I would if I could but I can't so I won't
et about you I almost do but I don't
So far baby I haven't come close
I would if I could but I can't so won't
Two stepping through Texas I couldn't swing away from you
Amarillo, Dallas, Houston might as well be the moon
If a lone star gal could pass through your twin
It was like seeing you again and again
I can't get over things getting over your blues
I would if I could but I can't so I won't
et about you I almost do but I don't
So far baby I haven't come close
I would if I could but I can't so i won't
I wish you were here
I wish you were gone
It's out of my hands to let go or hold on
I would if I could but I can't so I won't
et about you I almost do but I don't
So far baby I haven't come close
I would if I could but I can't so I won't
I would if I could but I can't so I won't
et about you I almost do but I don't
So far baby I haven't come close
I would if I could but I can't so won't
I would if I could but I can't so won't
