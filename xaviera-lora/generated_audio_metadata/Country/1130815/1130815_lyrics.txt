I read seven self-help books front to back
They said, "Girl, move on, you gotta be strong, get your life back on track"
Well they made it sound easy as one, two, three
But they don't know the hold that you got on me
I tried everything to get over you
But letting go of love is a hard thing to do
If your name keeps coming up on my phone
And your Facebook page still says you're alone
And the radio keeps playing our favorite song
Tell me how, tell me how, tell me how do I move on
Well they finally took down the old Ferris wheel
Remember the day you made me stay
Right until you could say how you feel
It's these kind of memories I gotta let go
But it's easier said than done you know
Cause I tried everything
To get over you
But letting go of love
Is impossible to do
If your name keeps coming up on my phone
And your Facebook page still says you're alone
And the radio keeps playing our favorite song
Tell me how, tell me how, tell me how do I move on?
I tried making a list of anything you ever did wrong
I tried drawing devil's horns on every picture of you
And just when I'm feeling okay and think I'm getting on
I see you walking and talking, laughing and holding someone new
What's a girl to do when your name ain't comin' up on my phone
And your Facebook no longer says you're alone
And you've probably got a new favorite song
So tell me how, tell me how, tell me, how do I move?
Tell me how, tell me how, tell me, how do I move?
Tell me how, tell me how, tell me how do I move on?
