Well it's raining and you kicked me out the door
Well it ain't enough to drown my love
But it's sure to leave me sore
And now it's raining
It's raining
It's raining and you invite me around
And then you thank me for the laughs
Stab me in the back
I know my sense of humour is off
But yours is black and now it's raining
It's raining
Well you got another man
But you can't stand him
But it still weighs heavy in my head
These traces in my bed
They said you might feel guilty
If your conscience wasn't dead
And now it's raining
It's raining
Did I tell you why your love was such a strain
Did I tell you why I washed it down the drain
Don't use me as a blanket trying to keep out the rain
I'm dripping while you're dry
You're laughing while I cry
Like the wind to the west
We're the water poopers
You ain't never gonna melt away
It's raining
It's raining
When you throw me out when the rain is through
Yeah, you talk me off when the rain is through
You're going out to find another man
That don't care what you do
It's raining, it's raining
In Brighton
In Brighton
