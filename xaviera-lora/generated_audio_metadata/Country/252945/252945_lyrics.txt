Point blank, yeah, looked into your eyes
I saw the devil and the angels switching sides
No thanks, I could live without the pain
So when our dance is done, please don't et
My blindfold and our cigarette
Who's he so afraid to fall?
And I'll say, you're not the only one who's hit the wall
So I got brave and stood my ground
And point blank you shot me down
Point blank, you let your heart beat next to mine
I never fell so hard
I never flew so high
Some things are maybe better left unsaid
But since you chewed me up and spit me out
You're everything I think about
You say you're so afraid to fall
And I say you're not the only one who's hit the wall
So I got brave and stood my ground
Point blank you shot me down
But I got brave and stood my ground
Shots rang out
I went down
We were lost, I was found
And we were together to the end
Until the shots rang out and then point blank
Like a bullet to the brain
If the lights go down
Then I will live to fight another day
They say you're so afraid to fall
And I say you're not the only one who's hit the wall
So I got brave and stood my ground
Point blank you shot me down
When I got ready and stood my ground
I stood my ground
And point blank you shot me down
