A windy cold November sky
Came along and passed me by
What's new? Still dreaming of you
Hanging round a jukebox joint
Has it made me change my point of view?
Still dreaming of you
In another life, you and I will ride the waves
Of a crystal bay, far away from here
But that dream don't seem to help me bide my time
it's still a crime, you're not here
Tomorrow will be yesterday
Like a distant ricochet it's true
Still dreaming of you
I don't mean to make a fuss
But I could have sworn I was all through
Still dreaming of you
Sometimes I wish I was in a different skin
I can't seem to win you in the one I've got
Though I know somehow I should by now be over you
The bitter truth is I'm not
I know we both said adios
But you and I aren't even close to through
Still dreaming of you
The feeling in my shattered soul
Only you can make me whole like glue
Still dreaming of you
Kind of blue
Still dreaming of you
Still dreaming of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, still dreaming of you
