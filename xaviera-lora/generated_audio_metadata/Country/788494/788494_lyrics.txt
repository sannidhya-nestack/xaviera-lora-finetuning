Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe, babe
It's the third time this week that we've been holding hands
Strolling down the beach writing letters in the sand
You say I'm ready but I'm new to this
Wanna go steady and you're hard to resist
Try to understand and I'll try to explain
You're driving me insane
Yes I love you, no I don't want to
Maybe I can't help myself
Yes, no maybe
I know that isn't a lot
Well, yes, I need you, and no, I don't need to
Maybe I'll leave you on the shelf
Yes, no, maybe, maybe that's all I've got
Now you're starting to turn your pressure high
And you're making me burn like it's do or die
I'm surprised no one ever asked you before
Aren't some things worth waiting for
If you think I'm someone you can use
Baby, you're confused
Yes, I love you, no, I don't want to
Maybe I can't help myself
Yes, no, maybe
I know that isn't a lot
Well, yes, I need you
No, I don't need to
Then maybe I'll leave you on the shelf
Yes, no, maybe
Maybe that's all I've got
I know sometimes you think I'm being a tease
But like I said, this is all so new to me
Yes, I love you, no, I don't want to
Baby, I can't help myself
Yes, no, maybe, I know that isn't a lot
Well, yes I need you and oh I don't need to
Maybe I'll leave you on the shelf
Yes, no, maybe
I know that isn't a lot
Yes, no, maybe
Baby that's all I've got
Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe babe
