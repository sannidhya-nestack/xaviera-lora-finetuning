You must be an angel
You must be heaven sent
You must be from paradise
Holy and innocent
You must be a river
Overflowing with grace
I can see eternity written all over your face
You must be the miracle, blessing from above
You must be a gift from God
That we might know His love
You must be a river Overflowing with grapes
I can see eternity written all over your face
You must be an angel
You must be heaven sent
You must be from paradise
Holy and innocent
