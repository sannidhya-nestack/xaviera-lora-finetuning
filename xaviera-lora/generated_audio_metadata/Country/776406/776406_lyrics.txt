Well the bill collector just called me
Seems my debts are piling high
And the gas pump raised ten cents today
But I ain't even got a dime
And I gotta drive ten miles to work but my truck got stuck in snow
Well that's just my luck there goes fifty more bucks to get that darn thing towed
And I said Lord, oh Lord will I ever catch a break
That's when I remembered he's the one I have to thank
Cause I got my summer I know it'll always be
Coming round this winter misery
And I love my country
Cause I know she'll never leave
Reminds me Lord don't sweat the little things
Don't sweat the little things
Well I made the fourth of shelf stop on this graveyard shelf tonight
When this stranger asked for a pack of marbles and he pulled out a forty five
Well as the people started to scramble I saw a child in the front
Without thought I dove to shield him as a stranger fired his gun
And I thought, Lord, I thank you for giving me this day
Yeah, I'm so grateful for every breath I take
I got my summer, I know it'll always be
Coming round this winter misery
And I love my country
I know she'll never leave
Reminds me, Lord, don't sweat the little things
You love me and you touch me
Every day I know you're by my side
I see you, I feel you
Every day I'm filled with pride
So proud to be alive
'Cause I got my summer, I know it'll always be
Coming round this winter misery
And I love my country'cause I know she'll never leave
Reminds me Lord don't sweat the little things
I got my summer I know it'll always be
Coming round this winter misery
And I love my country'cause I know she'll never leave
Reminds me Lord don't sweat the little things
Don't sweat the little things
