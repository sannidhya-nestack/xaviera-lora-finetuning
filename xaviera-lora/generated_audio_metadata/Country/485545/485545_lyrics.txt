The city is quiet
The moon's gone asleep
The bars are closed down
On Elizabeth Street
A cab at the light
He's looking around
To see if anyone's waiting
On the outskirts of town
The autumn wind
Is turning the leaves
I'm walking home
This night's just a memory
The morning light
Is coming soon
I'm still thinking about the time I spent with you
Tell me why
I'll spend this night alone if this is right
It's taking us too long, tell me why
My heart spins like a wheel, take this love
I can't keep it concealed
I cross the river
Walk up the hill
I'm almost home
And the air is still
I turn the key to my front door
The sun is rising and my bed is cold
I get so restless I turn on the TV
I wonder where you are
Are you thinking of me?
I go over and over
All the things we said
I've got a million questions
Swimming in my head
Tell me why
Let's spend this night of love if this is right
It's taking us too long, tell me why
My heart spins like a wheel, take this love
I can't keep it concealed, don't tell me why
I'll spend this night alone if this is right
It's dangerous
Tell me why (holding on, holding on)
My heart spins like a wheel
Take this love (holding on, holding on)
I can't keep it concealed
