I found the denim jacket that you gave me long ago
Years have passed but it still gives me comfort just to hold
Like an old love letter it has so many words to say
As if those summer nights would never ever fade away
Only the colors remain
Of blue denim blue
Warm summer nights
You're holding me
By the dashboard's pale light
First love at seventeen
In our hearts so true
I still keep the memory of you
In blue denim blue
That old denim jacket made a place for us to lay
I can almost smell the perfume I wore for you that day
Thinking'bout those blue eyes
I can see your smile as you handed me that jacket
Or the long chilling nights saying you'd be back by summertime
For that blue denim blue
Warm summer night
You're holding me
By the dashboard's pale light
First love at seventeen
In our hearts so true
I still keep the memory of you
In blue denim blue
We didn't need a reason for moving on (moving on)
For love can change with the seasons'til the summer's gone
From blue denim blue, warm summer nights
You're holding me
By the dashboard's pale light
First love of seventeen
In our hearts so true
I still keep the memory of you
In blue denim blue
Blue
