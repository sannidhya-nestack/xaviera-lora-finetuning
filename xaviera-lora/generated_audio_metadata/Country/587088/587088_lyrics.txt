She's standing in the ocean
Flowers in her hair
Sand sprinkled on her skin that's sun-kissed, naked bare
Close your eyes, can you see me
Reaching through your memory
Close your eyes, can you feel me
I've dreamed you for so long
She's standing on the mountain
Walked up a trail of grass
She sparkled and she shimmered
And this spell for him she cast
Handful of silver weaves
Lavender and shepherd's purse
A touch of Balma, Gilead and passion flower dropped in the dirt
Close your eyes, can you see me?
Reaching through your memory
Close your eyes, can you feel me?
I've dreamed you for so long
She sang a rhyme from nursery school and
Spun she round and round
And slept upon that moonlit hill, it was there she was found
Close your eyes, can you feel me reaching through your memory?
Close your eyes, can you see me? I've dreamed you for so long
I can't see the road signs
I've gone so far away
Close your eyes and be with me today
I can't see the roadside
I've gone so far away
Close your eyes and be with me today
Close your eyes and be with me today
Close your eyes and let me see
Close your eyes
