Where the beer's always cold and the music's always high
Where working men can make it to the top
From the highest mountains to the lowest plains
From the fields of hay to the San Francisco bay
Where the rubber meets the road and a nail meets a hammer
Where the sound of traffic spreads far and wide
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
The brakes were late in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
Where there's a place to escape they call Neverland
Where a man can speak his mind so others understand
From Cape Canaveral rockets splash into space
From coast to coast a place we all embrace
Where a man with a load can find a helping hand
Where we all tell the truth on the witness stand
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
We took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
Where the trains never stop they run night and day
Where you can fly to Hawaii if you wanna play
From a soup kitchen mania man is a
From a platform you can run as a candidate
Where a man with a talent is allowed to create
Where we all sit and cheer waitin' at home plate
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
The bricks were laid in the USA
The bricks were laid in the USA
It took a whole lot of sweat and a whole lot of pain
