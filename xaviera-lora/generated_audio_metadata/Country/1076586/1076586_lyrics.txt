Ooh, oh yeah
Hey, sky so blue, getting blue about the minute
It's a beautiful world and I'm blessed to be in it sometimes
Burning bright, time to share the light with everyone I see
It's a good day, good day to make somebody smile
Soaking in the sunshine, let those troubles unwind
Don't think I'll burn this close to heaven in a while
It's a good day, a good day to make somebody smile, ooh, oh yeah, ooh, yeah
Life's a journey, what a wonderful ride
You can't see the lows if you're focused on the highs
So I'm lifting up
Reaching down to bed, a time to spread love around
It's a good day, good day to make somebody smile
Soaking in the sunshine, let those troubles unwind
Don't think I've been this close to heaven in a while
It's a good day, good day, make somebody smile
What's it gonna cost?
What you gonna lose?
For helping someone melt away their blues
It's a good day, good day to make somebody smile
Soaking in the sunshine, let those troubles unwind
Don't think of being this close to heaven in a while
It's a good day, good day to make somebody smile
It's a good day, good day to make somebody smile
Soaking in the sunshine, let those troubles unwind
Don't think of being this close to heaven in a while
It's a good day (good day) good day to make somebody smile
Ooh, oh yeah, ooh hey
