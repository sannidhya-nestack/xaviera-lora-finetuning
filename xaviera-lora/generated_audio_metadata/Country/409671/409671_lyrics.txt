Oh yeah
I'm headed to a party
Gonna light a dance all night long
I feel just like a princess
With some pink glass slippers on
I expected my Prince Charming in a big white limousine
But he showed up in his pickup truck
But that's alright with me
We're gonna have a good time, I can feel it in the air
When we walk in, I hope there's something to share
At the stroke of midnight, I'll be dancing with my fella
I'm just a country girl, but I feel like Cinderella
Oh yeah
He pinned a pink horse to us
On my formal satin dress
His silk tie looks GQ
Under his tuxedo vest
He's looking like Keith Urban
Yeah I think he's kinda cute
And even though he's dressed up
That boy is wearing cowboy boots
We're gonna have a good time, I can feel it in the air
When we walk in, I hope there's time for cheer
At the stroke of midnight, I'll be dancing with my fellow
I'm just a country girl but I feel like Cinderella
Just like Cinderella
In my favorite Disney story
This country girl is going
To the ball in all her glory
I'm just a country girl but I feel like Cinderella
Feel like Cinderella
That's what I'm talking about
Feel like Cinderella (I'm just a country girl but I feel like Cinderella)
Feel like Cinderella
