My mama tried to clean me up in a new dress and clean white socks
So I did what I shouldn't do and I got a little mud on my Sunday shoes
I was raised to be strong, I stand up for where I come from
So one thing I know to be true, you gotta get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
life's too short to follow rules
Sometimes we're meant to break a few
You'll never know if you never choose
Get a little mud, get a little mud
Get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud
Get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
I've been told to hold my tongue on more than one occasion
I speak my truth and got this guy's approval
I like to get a little mud on my Sunday shoes
Get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Life's too short to follow rules
Sometimes we're meant to break a few
You'll never know if you never choose
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
I'm not afraid to stand my ground'cause I own this road I'm travelin' down
I've made my bed and I sleep peacefully
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud, Get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud, Get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Life's too short to follow rules sometimes we're meant
Break a few, you'll never know if you never choose
Never know if you never choose
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
Get a little mud, get a little mud, get a little, get a little mud on your Sunday shoes
