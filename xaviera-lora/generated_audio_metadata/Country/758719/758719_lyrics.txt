I'll never et the day I left
Little Violet cried and her mother said
As long as I live
I'll never ive you
I made rose red
Little violet blue
Rose is red
And violet is blue
Sugar you're sweet, I left them both for you
I know I'll pay for the pain I put them through
Rose is red and violet is blue
Our romance at home turned withered and brown
Your grass looked much greener so I laid down
I gave up the garden when I picked you
I made rose red and violet blue
Roses red
And violet is blue
Sugar you're sweet
I left them both for you
I know I'll pay for
The pain I put them through
Rose is red (rose is red) and violet is blue
Rose is red (rose is red) and violet is blue
