The Barstool prophets, they didn't know his name
But they'd tell, they'd tell all who came, who came
About the last great cowboy whose legend only grew
With every glass of brew and with each new round
They'd stand up and sing this tune
And the last great cowboy rides alone
Oh, the last great cowboy rides alone
He rides alone
Rides alone
The bar stool prophets
Said the town felt the fear
As the Richie Gang
The Richie Gang got near
They got near
And a call went out for anyone to send
Help before it was the end
With each new round they continued to tell the tale without fail
The last great cowboy rides along
And the last Greg Cowboy rides alone
He rides alone, rides alone, rides alone
And the Richie Gang showed up with four men strong
But the last great cowboy met them in the street
In the noon's searing heat as all guns were drawn
The cowboy fired four rounds, the Ritchie gang went down
And as he left, you can hear the sound of
The last great cowboy rides alone
Yeah, the last great cowboy rides alone
And those bar stool prophets
Now drunk and fast asleep
But tomorrow they'll be here
To tell the tale that they keep
And this is how it sounds
The last cowboy rides alone
Yeah, the last cowboy rides alone
And the last
Cowboy rides alone
The last cowboy rides alone
The last great cowboy rides alone
The last great cowboy
