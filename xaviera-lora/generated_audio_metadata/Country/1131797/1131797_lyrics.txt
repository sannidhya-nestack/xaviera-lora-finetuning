I sent you flowers by the dozen
Pretty roses, every one
I sent you texts by the thousands
You never read a single one
I've done tried it all
What's there left to do?
I've done everything I can
To show how much I love you
But if there's something else I can do
Another way to say I love you
Won't you tell me
If there's something else I can do
Another way to show I love you
Please tell me
I'll do anything you say
But take love away
There has to be just one more way
To say I love you
Oh
I sent you jewelry by the store for
Pretty trinkets everyone
I've sent you heartbeats by the minute
You never heard a single one
I've done tried it all
What's there left to do?
I've done everything I can
To show how much I love you
But if there's something else I can do
Another way to say I love you, won't you tell me?
If there's something else I can do
Another way to show I love you, please tell me
I'll do anything you say
But take love away
There has to be just one more way
To say I love you
Is there a mountain I can climb
A river I can swim
I'll do anything I can
To keep you away from him
Is there a bridge I can burn?
Something I can learn?
I'll do anything I can
To keep you away from him
No, no, no
If there's something else I can do
Another way to say I love you, won't you tell me?
If there's something else I can do
Another way to show I love you, please tell me
I'll do anything you say
But take love away
There has to be
Just one more way
To say I love you
