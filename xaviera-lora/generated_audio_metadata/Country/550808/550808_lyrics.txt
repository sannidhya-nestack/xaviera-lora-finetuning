When I was young I told my mom how I would be a man
That I would have a family just like her and dad
Now here I am thirty years later I'm afraid I failed my plan
And as we sit on my front porch
My darling hold my hand
Please stay with me darling
Like those times when we were kids
Please stay with me darling
Like oh wow for a little while
That night upon my porch was sad
The night you took my hand
And we began a family
Just like mom and dad
Now here we are
Thirty years later
Together lived our plan
And as we sit on our front porch
My darling hold my hand
Please stay with me darling
Like those times when we were kids
Please stay with me darling
Like oh wow for a little while
Please stay with me darling like those times when we were kids
Please stay with me darling like oh wow
For a little while
Please stay with me darling like oh wow
For a little while
