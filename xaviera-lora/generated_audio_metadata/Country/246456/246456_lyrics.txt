And I'm looking for that big paycheck
For all the money you're supposed to make
Suppose you're spending in the bar like having both the icing and the cake
It's me who loves you when you're feeling down, but
But someday soon I won't be around
Don't care right now if you live or die
Just be as happy to see you in the ground, and
I keep smelling for that awful scent
Of her all over you
You told me last time in your usual state
That it was all over and you would never be late
But your words are like ice cold and hot to the very core
She'll melt you with her girly entice
God knows she's no better than a whore
If I asked, have you been with her?
If I said, have you committed another sin?
If I asked, what would you say?
Are you gonna tell a poor face a lie
Will you sputter, stutter and start to cry
Are you gonna say it won't happen again
Will you ask me for one more try
If I ask you
Tired of loving you when you're down
Obviously there's a lot of you to go around
Hard to teach any old dog new tricks
You're way beyond any quick fix
But some days are already come
I got the kids packed in our old rusted truck
When you get here in your usual state
Don't bother looking
We won't be around
If I ask, ask you
If I ask, if I ask you
If I asked, have you been with her?
If I said, have you committed another sin?
If I asked, what would you say?
Are you gonna tell a bold faced lie?
Will you sputter, stutter and start to cry?
Are you gonna say it won't happen again?
Will you ask me for one more try?
If I ask you, ooh
If I ask you
Your words are ice cold and hard to the very core
And if I ask, have you been with her?
If I said, have you committed another sin?
If I asked, what would you say?
Are you gonna tell me your bold faced lie?
Will you sputter, stutter and start to cry?
Are you gonna say it won't happen again?
Will you ask me for one more try?
If I asked you
If I ask you, if I ask you
