Well, I'm living down cover and I'm living down cover and living down cover to love
Well, I'm living down cover and I'm living down cover and living down cover to love
So you roll up in that Cybertruck
All that tech is kinda stuck
Sweet and shiny but I don't care
Give me engines, give me air
I don't need no future ride
Keep it simple, let's go outside
Wanna feel the rumble under me
Big old truck's the key to be free
I don't want your cyber truck
I just want your big truck ride
Feel the power in the dirt
Take me where the wild things hide
Electric dreams, ain't my thing
Gimme diesel, gimme spring
Off the road, we're gonna fly
Just your big truck, you and I
Break it up let's hit the road
No more silent overload
Roaring engines in the night
That's the way it feels so right
I don't want your cyber truck
I just want your big truck ride
Feel the power in the dirt
Take me where the wild things hide
I don't want your cyber truck
I just want your big truck, right?
Feel the power in the dirt
Take me where the wild things hide
And I pump that power and I pump that power and live in that power love
Well, I pump that power and I pump that power and live in that power love
