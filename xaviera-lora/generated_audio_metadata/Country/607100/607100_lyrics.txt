Well, I love those smoky mountains in Tennessee
You can climb old Rocky Top so easily
Kick back, relax, enjoy the scenery
Yeah, anytime you need me, that's where I'll be
You're all invited to my backyard barbecue
We'll sit on the porch and sing old Hank Williams tunes
And talk a slice of life you won't find on the evening news
And if you were here, that's what we'd do
Up on the low side of that Mason-Dixon line
Where the country meets the sky and the sun always shines
All that simple way of living that you can only find
Is up on the low side of that Mason-Dixon Line
Y'all come down and have yourself a look-see
We'll go to the Grand Ole Opry
And the Ernest Tub Midnight Jamboree
Help yourself to a bit of Southern hospitality
And say hello to Miss Dolly
She's the Queen of Tennessee (Queen of Tennessee)
Yeah, she's the one and only Queen of Tennessee
Up on the low side of that Mason-Dixon line
Where the country meets the sky and the sun always shines
Oh that simple way of living that you can only find
Up on the low side of that Mason-Dixon line
Well you can settle down and raise up a family
And pretty soon you'll be seeing a sweet home Tennessee
Up on the low side of that Mason-Dixon line
Where the country meets the sky and the sun always shines on them
It's a growing living, but you can only find
Up on the low side (up on the low side)
Well that Mason-Dixon line is up on the low side (up on the low side
Well that Mason-Dixon line is up on the low side (up on the low side)
Well that Mason-Dixon line, yeah yeah yeah
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Yeah it is
