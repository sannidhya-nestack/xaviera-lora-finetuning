Every time I go out, I go out on a date
Here is how it goes
Everyone's got issues
It's like you need a box of tissues
To get past the low
So is it any wonder that we're going under?
Struggling against the tide, drowning in fear and pride
It's always such a fight, another wasted night
I want a man who will stand by my side
To spend the rest of my life with
I want a man with his heart open wide and a mind I can get with
I want a man who understands
That being in love doesn't mean giving up anything
Come on baby, come on, be a man
I want a man
Love is such a gamble, it's a game of cards
Do you risk it all to fold?
There's always so much drama
Boys who want their mamas
Or to control and run the show
Now I'm not perfect either, but baby I am eager
To leave the past in the past, build a love, build to last
And stand the test of time, this time
I want a man who will stand by my side to spend the rest of my life with
I want a man with his heart open wide
And a mind I can get with
I want a man who understands
That being in love doesn't mean giving up anything
Come on baby, be a man
I want a man
Not a boy, not a toy, not a trifle I can mess with
I want an equal, I want a friend
Too thick and thin until the very end
I want a man who will stand by my side to spend the rest of my life with
I want a man with his heart open wide and a mind I can get with
I want a man who understands that being in love doesn't mean giving up anything
Come on baby, be a man
'Cause I want a man (I want a man) who will stand on my side to spend the rest of my life with (baby, baby, I want a man) I want a man with his heart open wide and a mind like you can't wait (I want a man) I want a man who will stand on my side to spend the rest of my life with (I want a man) I want a man with his heart open wide and a mind like you can't wait
