Playing in the sandbox
Not ever knowing how time passes you by
You're just alive
Looking at you I see
A part of myself that's clearly shining through
Your eyes
Summer and fall will come
Winter and spring
No matter what changes
They will be
I'm always gonna love you and
I'll be there
To keep you warm through the storm and tenderly
As I look at the treetops
You're standing right next to me
You're growing strong
And everyday
You can be anything
No matter how hard life gets
Just remember to live
For today
Summer and fall will come
Winter and spring
No matter what changes they will be
I'm always gonna love you and
I'll be there
To keep you warm through the storm
And tenderly
Play away little child
You're a long, long way from home
You're a long way from home
Like a breeze from the ocean
Blowing across my face
I can feel it but don't know where
It came from
I'm grateful for the times we've had
But there's an empty space inside
You were taken from me
And now you're gone
Summer and fall will come
Winter and spring
No matter what changes they will be
I'm always gonna love you and
I'll be there
To keep you warm through the storm
And tenderly
Play away little child
You're a long, long way from home
Play away little child
You're a long, long way from home
Long way from home
You're a long way from home
You're a long way from home
Long way from home
