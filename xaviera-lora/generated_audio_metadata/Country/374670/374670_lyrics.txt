Chickens up in the old pine tree
Chickens up in the old pine tree
Chickens up in the old pine tree
Trying to get away from that water
Water bound and I can't get home
Water bound and I can't get home
Water bound and I can't get home
Down in North Carolina
The old man's mad and I don't care
The old man's mad and I don't care
The old man's mad and I don't care
As long as I get his daughter
If he don't give her up we're gonna run away
If he don't give her up we're gonna run away
If he don't give her up we're gonna run away
Down to North Carolina
Waterbound and I can't get home
Waterbound and I can't get home
Waterbound and I can't get home
Down in North Carolina
Me and Tom and Dave gone home
Me and Tom and Dave gone home
Me and Tom and Dave gone home
Before the water rises
Water bound and I can't get home
Water bound and I can't get home
Water bound and I can't get home
Down in North Carolina
I'm going back to the one I love
I'm going back to the one I love
I'm going back to the one I love
Down in North Carolina
Waterbound and I can't get home
Waterbound and I can't get home
Waterbound and I can't get home
Down in North Carolina
