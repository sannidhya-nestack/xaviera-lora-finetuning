Halfway up the ladder was as far as I could go
No matter how I tried I couldn't make it all the way down the road
Since we met in the middle we've gone twice as far
Dreams that once were out of reach are near as your heart
I have the will, you have the way
Together there's nothing we can't face
No stopping us, we've got what it takes
I have the will, you have the way
When I hold you in my arms, I'm the strongest man alive
And when I lean on you, there's no mountain I can't climb
Baby, you're my better half, now my life's complete
Since the day we met, you've been the best part of me
I have the will, you have the way
Together there's nothing we can't face
No stopping us, we've got what it takes
I have the will, you have the way
Where would I be without you in the middle of nowhere
To get to where we are I needed you to take me
I have the will, you have the way
Together there's nothing we can't face
No stopping us, we've got what it takes
I have the will, you have the way
We've got what it takes
I have the will, you have the way
I have the will, you have the way
Girl, I have the will, you have the way
I have the will, you have the way
I have the will, you have the way
