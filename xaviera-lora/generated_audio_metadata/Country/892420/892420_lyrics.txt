The needle on my Chevy's pegged at sixty-five
I'm driving home from work and it's a real nice ride
Don't care about having dinner or what's on TV
I grab a button, sign in to eHarmony
Because we fell in love on the internet
But baby I ain't seen you yet
Is this something that I might regret?
Finding love on the internet
I'll be wearing my new five stars
We'll be meeting at my favorite bar
This is something that I want to get
Finding love on the internet
I was feeling kinda lonely so I took the test
I answered all the questions and I did my best
They tell me, baby, a perfect match you'd be
But I ain't seen your picture and it's scaring me
Because we fell in love on the internet
But baby I ain't seen you yet
Is this something that I might regret
Finding love on the internet
You're gonna love my personality
Cause they picked us scientifically
This is something that I won't et
Finding love on the internet
I know you must be lonely
And dying to meet me
Cause I got a nice house and a real good job
And a new wide screen TV
But still we fell in love on the internet
But baby I ain't seen you yet
Is this something that I might regret
Finding love on the internet
Is this something that I might regret
Finding love on the internet
Wait a minute baby
Come back you're hot
Don't you see me in your rear view mirror
Okay I want my forty dollars back
