Ooh yeah
I like to watch people walk by when I'm in a crowd
Everybody's trying to be somebody, I start laughing out loud
Gucci shoes, a belly ring, designer clothes that show everything
A little skin, a little grin, a tummy tuck so they can stay thin
It's such a crazy thing
It's like they're living in a magazine
Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wants to be somebody
If they could only be just who they are
I see him cruise by everyday
Mr. GQ man
Everybody's trying to be somebody
Got a tie and a tan
The top down, what a view
Wind blows through his hundred dollar due
Got the chrome, got the phone
Pump some iron on his way home
It's such a crazy thing
It's like they're living in a magazine
Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wants to be somebody
If they could only be just who they are
It's such a crazy thing
It's like they're living in a magazine
Everybody wants to be somebody
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wants to be somebody
If they could only be just who they are
Everybody wants to be somebody (be somebody)
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wants to be somebody
If they could only be just who they are
(Wants to be somebody)
Everybody (everybody)
(Wants to be somebody)
Everybody (everybody)
(Wants to be somebody)
