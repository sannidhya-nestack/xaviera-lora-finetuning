One of these days I'm gonna be a big boy
One of these days I'm gonna be a man
One of these days I'll ask the Lord
To take me to the promised land
And I'll ride my tractor round and round
John Deere would be so proud
I'll fill my cup and lift it up
I'll add a buck in the back of my pickup truck
Oh, let me go
Mississippi mud on a country road
Oh, please let me be
Mississippi mud gonna set me free
Take me out, take me home
Take me up in a cloud of dust and strain me to the bone
Mississippi mud, Mississippi mud
Mississippi mud runs in my blood
Mississippi mud on a country road
One of these days I'm gonna drink whiskey
One of these days I'll drink a little gin
One of these days I'll ask for the Lord to save my soul
So I can drink again
And I learned to tell my rhyme from Rome
From an old school Hank Williams song
Wheel drive is a friend of mine
country boys can't survive, oh, oh
Let me go, Mississippi mud on a country road
Oh, please let me be
Mississippi mud gonna set me free
Take me out, take me home
You stained my jeans and you stained my soul
Mississippi mud, Mississippi mud
Mississippi mud runs in my blood
Mississippi mud on a country road
Cowboy boots and old blue jeans
Mississippi mud and gasoline
Wash my hands, can't keep'em clean
Mississippi mud gonna stick to me
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little gin
Rise and shine on the fields again
Drink a little moonshine, drink a little
I wash my hands when the day is done
And I'm proud to say I was born and raised
Custom made in the USA
Jackson City, Mississippi, oh, that's where I'll stay
Oh, oh, let me go
Mississippi mud on a country road
Oh, please, let me be
Mississippi mud gonna set me free
Take me home, stain my jeans and you stain my soul
Mississippi mud, Mississippi mud
Mississippi mud runs in my blood
Mississippi mud, yeah
On a country road, oh yeah
Mississippi mud, yeah, yeah
Gonna set me free
Mississippi mud, Mississippi mud
Wash my hands, can't keep'em clean
