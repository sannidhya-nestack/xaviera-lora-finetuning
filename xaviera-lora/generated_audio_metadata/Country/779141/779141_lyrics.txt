Her hair was sundown, shadowed long
I lost all track of right or wrong
I tried so hard but could not speak
My tongue was tied, my mouth was dry
The truth was shining in her eyes
When I heard her say these words to me
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You've been riding great on them old bulls tonight
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You could make the next ride the best ride of your life
I pride myself on being tough
But I know when I've had enough
And I knew I'd be giving in to her
I knew I didn't stand a chance
So I asked her for one slow dance
And once again she whispered these words
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You've been riding great on them old bulls tonight
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You can make the next ride the best ride of your life
Now I get plenty lucky almost every night
Ever since I made that crazy girl my wife
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You've been riding great on them old bulls tonight
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
You could make the next ride the best ride of your life
You could make the next ride the best ride of your life
Hey cowboy, wanna get lucky
