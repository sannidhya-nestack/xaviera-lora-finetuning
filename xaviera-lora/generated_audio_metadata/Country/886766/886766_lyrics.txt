Can't concentrate when I'm at work
There's one thing on my mind
I got a case of jukebox fever
A crazy craving for 45's
At quitting time I'm out of here
My half ton knows the way
I make a beeline down to Bubba's Pub
With my pocket full of change
I'm jukin' just jukin'
A roll of quarters and I'm headed for
My favorite honky-tonk juke disorder
The last call means one more tune
I save the quarter in my lip boot
For emergency use when I'm jukin'
At Bubba's there's a bar stool
With my name and flashing lights
It's my piece of neon heaven
For two bits I'm in paradise
I like my country rowdy
I can't ever get enough
I'm gonna keep that jukebox rocking
Till Bubba pulls the plug
'Cause I'm jukin', just jukin'
A roll of quarters and I'm headed for
My favorite honky-tonk juke, Dijon
The last call means one more tune
I saved a quarter in my left boot
For emergency use
When I'm jukin'
Last call means one more tune
I saved a quarter in my lift boot
For emergency use
When I'm jukin'
