Leaving town at three AM on a forty foot sleeper
Drifting through the rainy night feet up on the heater
This band's a rowdy gang our ears are ringing
We're instagramming all our fans say hi
And singing
I love life on the road
Late nights anything goes
Roll down all the windows
Country on the radio
I love playing my songs
Wild fans grooving along
Oh, oh, oh
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
Sunrise, bleary eyes, diesel engine humming
Some fan is texting me, says she has our drummer
Sometimes there are lonely nights, but nothing else can beat it
Selfie at the T-Bell exit 9, don't tweet it
I love life on the road, late nights anything goes
Roll down all the windows
Country on the radio
I love playing my songs
Wild fans grooving along
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
You won't be impatient to reach your destination
If you love how you roll
And I love life on the road
Late nights anything goes
Roll down all the windows
Country on the radio
I love playing my songs
Wild fans grooving along
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
I love life on the road
