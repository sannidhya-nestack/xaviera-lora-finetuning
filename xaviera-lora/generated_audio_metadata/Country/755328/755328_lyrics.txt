I put a lot of miles on my heart rolling down love's highway
And if there's any wisdom I've gained it's in what I'm about to say
Holding love is like holding a dove in your hands
You gotta hold it tight enough
So it won't fly away
But be careful you don't hold it too tight
Or you just might kill it
My favorite recipe for love doesn't cost one single buck
It's one part slow dancing
Two parts romancing
And a heaping spoon of luck
Holding love is like holding a dove in your hands
You gotta hold it tight enough
So it won't fly away
But be careful you don't hold it too tight
Or you just might kill it
So if you've got somebody to love
Hold on tight but loose enough
Because holding love is like holding a dove in your hands
You gotta hold it tight enough
So it won't fly away
But be careful you don't hold it too tight
Or you just might kill it
I put a lot of miles on my heart rolling down love's highway
