At sixty-eight years of age
Chips Kane had done ten million miles
He drove a Louisville concrete truck
And gave his service with a smile
But Chips knows only too well
What concrete drivers dread
Is when the motor turn on the bowl stops dead
When the sun is burning
Keep that boiler turning
A lesson to be learning
Keep that cement churning
In the middle of the summer when it's thinking hot
If the bowl stops turning gonna cost you a lot
You get ten ton of solid crete and a useless bowl
It was a hundred degrees in the shade fifty miles from town
No mechanic and no garage anywhere around
The sweat was spillin' in his eyes
But it came as an awful surprise
When the motor roundin' the bowl broke down
When the summer's burning
Keep that bowl returning
A lesson to be learning
Keep that cement churning
In the middle of the summer when it's thinking hot
If the bowl stops turning gonna cost you a lot
You get ten ton of solid crete and a useless bowl
I really can't repeat the words he probably said
But he got back in that truck and made that engine rev
You'd think he was being chased by the hounds from hell
he got back into town to bid that load farewell
When the summer's burning
Keep that bowl returning
A lesson to be learning
Keep that cement churning
In the middle of the summer when it's thinking hot
If the bowl stops turning gonna cost you a lot
You get ten ton of solid crete and a useless bowl
In the middle of the summer when it's thinking hot
If the bowl stops turning gonna cost you a lot
You get a tent and a solid crete and a useless bowl
