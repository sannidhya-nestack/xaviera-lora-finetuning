If you've ever wondered since high school what became of me
I've got it well documented for the whole world to read
You will see I'm not lonely, I've got 39 ,000 friends
Since you and I go way back
I'll put you in the top twenty of them
Taking up space on MySpace
Surfing for a friend
People don't socialize like they did before it began
We looked for love in honky-tonks
Went on dates in movie drive-ins
Taking up space on MySpace
Surfing for a friend
Taking up space on MySpace
Surfing for a friend
Now this could be a good day
It looks like I've got some mail
Kind comments'bout my music
That I've been trying to sell
So far I've made no money
I'm just trying to keep a dream alive
If you ever want to say hello I log in every day at five
Taking up space on my space
Surfing for a friend
People don't socialize like they did before it began
We looked for love in honky-tonks
Went on dates to movie drive-ins
Takin' up space on MySpace
Surfin' for a friend
Takin' up space on MySpace
Surfin' for a friend
Taking up space on my space
Surfing for a friend
