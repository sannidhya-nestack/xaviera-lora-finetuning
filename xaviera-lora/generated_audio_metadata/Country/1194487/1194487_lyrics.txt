Mm-hmm, uh-huh
I wasn't weed drunk or desperate
Didn't think about love or affection, no
Wasn't out for romance
I wasn't hurt, sad, or lonely
Wasn't looking for someone to hold me tonight
It was all by chance
Stronger than a shot of Tennessee whiskey
First kiss and the feeling hit me
I just knew you were the one
We were all eyes, all arms, all night, all hearts
How did we fall so deep in love
Maybe it's fate or just blind luck
Years passed still together
Looking back on the memory we made that night
Making love by the fireside, yeah
Stronger than a shot of Tennessee whiskey
First kiss and the feeling hit me
I just knew you were the one
We were all eyes, all arms, all night, all ours
How did we fall so deep in love?
Maybe it's fate or just blind luck, whoa
Maybe it's just blind luck, whoa
What if we never slow danced, never hooked up
Never took a chance on real love
Everything happens for a reason
Stronger than a shot of Tennessee whiskey
First kiss and the feeling hit me
I just knew you were the one
We were all eyes, all arms, all neck, all heart
How did we fall so deep in love? Maybe it's fate or just blind love
Whoa, maybe it's just blind luck (blind luck)
Whoa, how did we fall so hard? (how did we fall so deep?)
How did we fall in love? Maybe it's fate or just blind luck
Maybe it's fate or just blind love (just blind love)
