Old Frog sitting on a cypress lawn
Singing to his pretty little Polly Wong
Swamps are swimming with gators and snakes
Wishing they could take my place
The moon's shining down on you and me
There's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than walking in the bayou, bayou
Knowing you feel the way that I do
Louisiana magic and Cajun spice
You and me in paradise
Couldn't feel any better if I tried to
Walking in the bayou, bayou
Walking in the bayou, bayou
Met the queen of a gypsy band
She had six fingers on each hand
Her eyes gave off a blinding light
Her crystal ball lit up the night
She told us love was in the stars
She must have gazed into our hearts
Walking in the bayou, bayou
Knowing you feel the way that I do
Louisiana magic and Cajun spice
You and me in paradise
Couldn't feel any better if I tried to
Walking in the bayou, bayou
Walking in the bayou, bayou
Yay!
Yeah, walkin' in the bayou, bayou
Know when you feel the way that I do
Louisiana magic and Cajun spice, you and me in paradise
Couldn't feel any better if I tried to
Walkin' in the bayou, bayou
Walkin' in the bayou, bayou
Walkin' in the bayou, bayou
