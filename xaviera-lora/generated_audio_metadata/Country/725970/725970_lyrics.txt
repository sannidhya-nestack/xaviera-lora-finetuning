I walked into the gold rush on the darker side of town
I found an empty bar stool and set my troubles down
I said, "Give me a double of whatever she is drinking"
I started pouring out my heart to her before I started thinking
I talked about the love I'd lost and the pain that pulled me here
While that broken down old jukebox brought us both to tears
We moved around the dance floor in a night owl neon blue
I said don't my broken heart look good on you
Don't my broken heart look good on you
Although it's torn and tattered and a little used
With a little patching up it could be just like new
Don't my broken heart look good on you
When the lights came on and the last song died
I kept my arms around her
With every beat of my beating heart
I thank God that I found her
I held her close and whispered, "Baby, it's sad but it's true
Don't my broken heart look good on you?"
Don't my broken heart look good on you
Although it's torn and tattered and a little used
With a little patching up it could be just like new
Don't my broken heart
Don't my broken heart
Oh, my broken heart
Look good on you
