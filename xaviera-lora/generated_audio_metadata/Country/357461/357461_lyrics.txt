After we were over, I went to see my shrink
She said, "Listen, honey darling, I'm gonna tell you what I think
You need some getting over him and here's what you can do
Go out and buy yourself a toy and it'll take good care of you"
So I don't need you anymore, my dear
I bought myself a toy
Well, it keeps me company all night long
And it brings me so much joy
Well, I laugh and I smile and I cry out loud
And there's just nothing it won't do, oh boy
I don't need you anymore, my dear
I bought myself a toy
When I'm feeling lonely
And when I'm missing you
I just snap that baby right out of the case
And it gets rid of my blues
Well it's all the man that I need right now
And it don't fight with me
I'm unliberated
Want me now,'cause I control the speed
I don't need you anymore, my dear,'cause I bought myself a toy
Well, it keeps me company all night long, and it brings me so much joy
Well, I laugh and I smile and I cry out loud, and there's just nothing it won't do
Oh boy, I don't need you anymore, my dear, because I bought myself a toy
A little battery operated wonder
My twelve inch bundle of joy
Keeps me on the straight and narrow
I sure do love my joy
I don't need you anymore, my dear
I bought myself a toy
Well, it keeps me company all night long
And it brings me so much joy
Well, I laugh and I smile and I cry out loud
And there's just nothing it won't do, oh boy
I don't need you anymore, my dear
I bought myself a toy
I don't need you anymore, my dear
I bought myself a toy
Woo! Woo! Woo!
