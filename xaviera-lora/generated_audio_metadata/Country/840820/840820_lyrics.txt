I can't stop thinking about you
I'm never lonely without you
I stare at your picture all day at work
When I try to sleep I toss and turn
Looking ahead in time
Dreamin' about our life
I see you and me, a family
Two kids, a dog and a cat
I see down the road us growin' old
Our grandson on your left
I see us together, in love forever
And though it's only a dream
I like what I see
I've only known you a short time
But I don't need any more time
My hands are shaking, I'm down on my knees
I've fallen in love, will you marry me?
I promise with all of my heart
Say yes and forever we'll start
I see you and me, a family
Two kids, a dog and a cat
I see down the road us growing old
Our grandson on your lap
I see us together in love forever
And though it's only a dream
I like what I see
Nobody knows what the future holds
But as long as I'm holding you
I have a clue
Ooh, I see you and me, a family
Two kids, a dog and a cat
I see down the road us growing old
Our grandson on your lap
I see us together, in love forever
And though it's only a dream
I like what I see
I like what I see
I like what I see
