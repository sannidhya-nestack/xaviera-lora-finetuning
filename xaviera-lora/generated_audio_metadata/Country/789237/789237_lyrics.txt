I've known autumn evenings softer than a prayer
Chapters from my childhood when I didn't have a care
But if someone asked me what's the best thing I knew
I'd have to tell them knowing you
I've chased purple twilight and danced in velvet rain
I've seen a lot of things I still can't explain
But of everything I've witnessed nothing comes close to
The thrill I've had just knowing you
But knowing you, you'd give the credit to somebody else
Knowing you, you'd leave your pride up high on the shelf
Knowing you, you'd grin and give that aw shucks attitude
Maybe that's why I like knowing you
If I had a genie at my beck and call
And he had to give me everything at all
If every prayer was answered and every wish came true
The best would still be knowing you
There's nothing quite like knowing you
You know I've been around the block a time or two
And nothing's good as knowing you
But knowing you, you drug and say it's nothing at all
Knowing you explains why it's so easy to fall
So I guess it's no surprise why more than a few
People wouldn't mind knowing you
But it hurts when I see it with somebody else
Though I know I've got no one to blame but myself
It may be a shame but I am grateful just the same
I had the chance of knowing you
The best part of my life is knowing you
Knowing you
