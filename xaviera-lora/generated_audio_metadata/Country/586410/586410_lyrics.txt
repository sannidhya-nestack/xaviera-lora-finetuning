She waits for his call
Knowing it may not come at all
She longs to hear his voice on the line
She knows it's not right
But her conscience is too weak to fight
She's torn between the truth and her lies
She's caught between a rock and a heartache
So took a vow that now she can't keep
She wanted love that wasn't hers to give or to take
She's caught between a rock and a hard egg
She turns out the light
Staring into the starless night
She wishes on his love to change her life
A voice in her heart
Whispers until death do us part
A promise disappears in the dark
Caught between a rock and a heartache
She took a vow that now she can't keep
She wanted love that wasn't hers to give or to take
She's caught between a rock and a heartache
She was caught between a rock and a heartache
She took a vow that now she can't keep
She wanted love that wasn't hers to give or to take
She's caught between a rock and a Harley
She's caught between a rock and a Harley
She's caught between a rock and a Harley
