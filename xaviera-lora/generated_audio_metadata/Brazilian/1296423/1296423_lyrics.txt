The sea whispers secrets
Palm trees sway with grace
In the heart of Rio's dreams
We dance our own things
Starlight on the ocean sprays glow
Whispers in the night we sway (hearts a-toe)
Underneath the mystic moon (stunning)
Lost in dreams that end too soon (sweet cascade)
Feel the rhythm of the waves (soft embrace)
Echoes through the endless cave (searing glaze)
Every note a lover's sigh is filled
With the moonlighting skies as well
Gypsy winds weave melodies so sweet
Dancers in the midnight breeze
(Equipped feet)
In the air a silence soon will become
Evoking love's gentle swoon we become
Feel the rhythm of the waves (soft embrace)
Echoes through the endless caves (secret place)
Every note a lover's sigh (her spell)
With the moonlighting skies (its swell)
Beneath the stars we find our way
Guide light, feeling every beat convey
