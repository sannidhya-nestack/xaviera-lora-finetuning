Oh, like on the waves, this way slow and slow
Love stories in the breeze where lovers go
Walking close beside down the sandy shore
And the stars do gleam softly like a dream
Your hand in mine, such a gentle feel
Whispers in the night of our love so pure
With a heart-string beat
Dancing to the tide, voices in encore
Like a secret tune
Underneath the moon shadows play in time
(The shadows often do)
Echoes of our laugh blending with the night
(Melodies entwine)
Eyes that speak so much share the silent rhyme
(With a knowing glance)
In this evening hush hearts begin to climb
(A quiet gate)
Every single step leads to love profound
(Where the heart's at ease)
Every gentle touch wraps us in delight
(Like a tender breeze)
Songs of whispered love floating all around
(In the summer air)
Moments we create shining ever bright
Like a silver stream
Gazing at the stars, feeling so complete
Under skies so vast
Holding on to dreams, not a bit too late
As the moments pass
Painting memories where our shadows meet
On a canvas pure
In this endless dance, sealing our shared fate
With graceful twirl
Listen to your voice like a soothing chord
So serene and warm
Finding in your smile all I ever need
In a glowing form
Hearts that beat in sync with a silent word
In a deep concord
Living the serene out upon the sea
Where love will transform
