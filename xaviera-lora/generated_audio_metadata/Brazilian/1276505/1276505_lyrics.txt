In the morning light we dance so slow
On a gentle breeze where the warm winds blow
Coffee cups and lazy smiles moving to the rhythm
Life's a sweet big isle
Whispered secrets in the palms embrace
Time just pauses in the sunlit space
In your eyes, the ocean's endless blue
Hold me close, the world's a dream, just me and you
Every wave that kisses golden sand
Writes a love song only we understand
Laughter echoes through this lazy day
Wrapped around each other as the moments sway
Whispered secrets in the palms embrace
Time just pauses in this sunlit space
In your eyes the ocean's endless blue
Hold me close, the world's a dream, just me and you
Colors blend as twilight starts to fall
In this twilight we et it all
