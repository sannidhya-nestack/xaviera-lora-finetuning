Let's find a little sunshine in the rhythm of the waves
We'll dance to the melody of a golden coastal breeze
Morning light whispers softly
Ocean's call is like a symphony
Driftwood stories in the sand
Dreamers gather on the stress
In the sunlight we feel free
Hearts are swaying like the trees
Laughing echoes through the air
Love is painted everywhere
Waves are secrets shared with shores
Palms are reaching out to more
Every step imprints a beat
Beach romance just can't be beat
In the sunlight we feel free
Hearts are swaying like the trees
Laughing echoes through the air
Love is painted everywhere
Together here the world seems bright
Underneath the starry night
Every kiss is a promise sealed
In this rhythm we're revealed
