Under the gentle sway of the palm trees
We find our hidden rhythm
In the night where melodies glided frequently
Waves whisper secrets hidden treasures found
Stars paint the sky bright guiding my way home
Soft breeze plays a tune dancing in the dark moon
Cast a silver glow
Dreams upon the shore
Footsteps trace our love
Etching in the sand
Hearts be in sync
Echoes through the night
Eyes locked
In pure enchantment
Silent symphony
Smile of timeless grace
Passion's gentle light
Wrapped in this bossa bliss
Heartbeat of a soul
Time takes a soft pause
Serene whispers sway
Laughter twirls like leaves
Caught in a warm breeze
Every touch a spark
