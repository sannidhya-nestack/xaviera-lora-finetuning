In the heart of Rio where dreams dance with the sea
We find ourselves moved by the rhythms of life, love
And longing let the melodies caress your soul
And the whispers linger in your mind
Warming waves
Kiss the shore
Gentle whispers
Sunlight paints on every door
Sweeping tall
Breeze embracing
Asking silence
Life's a dance we all adore
Hear the stories in the air
Soft murmur, feel the rhythm everywhere
Beating heart, steps that lead without a care
Golden thread, miracles without repair
Endless sparks
On the street, glowing trails
Shadows play hide and seek, midnight dream
Echoes of the past we meet whispered till
Love in every glance we greet, silent schemes
Hear the stories in the air, soft murmur, feel the rhythm
Everywhere, beating hearts, steps that lead without a care
Golden thread, miracles without repair, endless sparks
Moonlight sprinkles on the street
Glowing trails, shadows play
Hide and seek, midnight dream
Echoes of the past we meet
Whispered tales, love in every glance we greet
Stars above with secret gleaming wishes
Lovers float as if they dream, silent dance
Life is more than it may seem, mystic bliss
Every note a vivid theme, lucky chance
