Underneath the moonlit canopy of stars above
We dance through endless moments, timeless whispers of love
Your eyes hold ancient secrets more than words can say
In this dance of hearts I'm feeling love that never fades away
By the ocean's gentle breath where the waves softly kiss
Every heartbeat serenades a symphony of bliss
Timeless love flows with the tide never bound by years
In your arms I find a haven far from doubts and fears
Forever isn't long enough when I'm here with you
Every glance and every touch feels like something new
In this world of fleeting time, our love remains so true
Endlessly we'll wander through a timeless hue
Beneath the shadows of the palms tracing memories
