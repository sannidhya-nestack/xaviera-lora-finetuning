Under the night the skies tender glow
Drift on waves of soft whispers
Where dreams and melodies intertwine
The gentle dance for hearts to know
Stars glimmer soft in twilight's eye
Whispers of leaves rustle in tune
Our shadows waltz beneath the moon
Love's quiet hymn
Our hearts reply
Sand between toes
The ocean song
Palm trees sway with a loving grace (a loving grace)
In these moments we find our place
Rhythms of night where, where we belong (where we belong)
Where we belong (where we belong)
Songs will serenade our melody (our melody)
A symphony of whispered dreams
In each other's arms
The night redeems
A love that sings so tenderly
Eyes meet in starlights, gently (gentlely, gently)
Words unspoken yet so clear (in this embrace)
In this embrace there's no fear (there's no fear)
We float together in this dream (in this dream)
The dawn will come as it always does
But morning won't take this away
For in our hearts this night will stay
In every sigh and love buzz
Sand between toes, the ocean song
