Underneath the moonlit sky
Where the samba unravels softly
We find the whispers of Rio
Playing in the air
The rhythm of the night dances within
Until the morning light
Café lights flicker bright
City song
Gentle breeze in the night
Feathers long
Echoes of a distant tune (timeless home)
Whispers in the velvet room (guitar strum)
Streets that hum a lullaby (soft embrace)
Waves that kiss the shore goodnight (mermaid's grace)
Stars are glittering above (silent glint)
Love that slides without a fight (heart's hint)
Real breath and harmony on the call.
Dreams wrapped up in melodies (our needs grow)
Every moment feels entwined (that of peace)
With the rhythm of the night, endlessly
Laughter floats on gentle air (subtle breeze)
Footsteps dance without a care (hearts of peace)
River flows in gentle curling tide
Stories of this wonderful guy
Colors paint the evening glow, artist's brush
In the moon's enchanting show, lights a peach
Eyes that needn't melt away, lover's glimpse
Music that will always stay, passion's chant
