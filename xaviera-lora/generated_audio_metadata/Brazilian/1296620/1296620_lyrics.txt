Whispers by the beach where the sand meets the sea
Life's a gentle wave dancing to a timeless melody
Sunset paints the sky, waves gently kiss the shore
Palm trees sway in tune
The rhythm of the night stars begin their dance
Laid back on the sand (trees)
Listening to the tide (songs)
Footprints in the dust
Echoes of our past loves a fleeting touch
As moonlight on the wave
Flickers of the heartbeat synch with time
Resumes the circles of a laugh
Dissolve into the night
Whispers of the name
Vanish out of sight
City lights far off (ring, ring, five, five)
Mysteries unfold (in your life)
Breathing in the night (scent of ocean air)
Holding every sign
Drifting through the dreams (falling with the wind)
Tangled in a wish (helping last)
The day will break too soon
Ringing in the dawn
Moments fade away
But the feeling lingers on
