In the warmth of the night
Under moonlight's gentle glow
Let's dance to whispers that only we can know
Gently we sway like the trees
Fingers entwined with a breeze (small little kiss)
Lost in the rhythm we find (waves)
Dreams that the ocean unwinds (sounds break)
Stars sprinkle thoughts in our minds
Sure sing the old lullabies (nose)
Every step a love knows (nose call)
Each heartbeat a secret we told (silver beams)
Your voice a melody sweet (browns your face)
Eyes like a tranquil retreat (shoes, gaze)
Moments that melt into space (sense)
Forever entwined in this place (tides)
Echoes of laughter entwined (silence)
Dancing on whispers we spin (winds)
Seers that tangle our hints (gentle ties)
Waves that remind us to kiss (seas to skies)
Heartbeats that mirror the waves (mirrors of song)
Mystery in the way that we sway (the magic lore)
Songs that the night always sings (never this cold)
Steps that we trace in the bed (never more)
Heartbeats that mirror the way the soul
