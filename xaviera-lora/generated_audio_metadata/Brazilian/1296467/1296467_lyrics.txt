When the sun dips low and the waves kiss the shore
Kiss the swaying rhythm that's slow and show hardness
With whispers of the breeze gently guiding our steps
Hit your melody
Moonlight dances soft on our skin (the river's touch)
We float through the night as shadows spin (timeless tales)
Each step a story and every glance a season (poetry)
Love in motion where we've both been (memories interlace)
Stars blink, secrets in the sky above
Cosmic riddles, our laughter flows just like a dove
Feather free, hold me close in this endless groove
Eternal dream, lost in the night like a hand in a glove
Feel the rhythm of the ocean song
Your heartbeat matches mine all along
We beat in our dance, we find where we belong
Together we'll waltz'til the break of dawn
Guillotine breeze
Gentle chords strung the notes of our soul
Harmonic tie, unspoken words in the rhythm control
Silent duet, with every movement
The evening unfolds, night's tapestry
Two hearts bound with calm seroles
Echoes whisper through the salty air
Ancient lullabies
Fingers trace dreams without a care
Dreamers time
Drift like ships on the twilight tide
And as voyage
Wrapped in each other, unaware
Sailors embrace
Feel the rhythm of the ocean song
Your heartbeat matches mine all along
The beats in our dance, we find where we belong
Together we'll waltz'til the break of dawn
Delight and grace
Feel the rhythm of the ocean song
Your heartbeat matches mine all along
You could be
In our dance we fight where we belong
Circles
Together we'll waltz
Till the break of dawn
Daylight's embrace
Together we'll be
Gentle chords strum the notes of our souls
Harmonic time, unspoken words in the rhythm control
Silent duet with every movement
The evening unfolds, night's tapestry to end
