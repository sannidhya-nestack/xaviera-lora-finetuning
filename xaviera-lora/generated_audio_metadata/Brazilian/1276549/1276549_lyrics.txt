By the seaside where the gentle breezes play in the evening
As the sun begins to sway we are dancing
To the whispers of the tide in the moonlight
With the world set aside hold me closer
Let the rhythm draw us near in this moment
Everything is crystal clear and the stars above
They twinkle in our eyes, lost in laughter
As the night begins to rise, feel the sand beneath
As we glide and sway, soft guitars serenade, guiding our way
Every heartbeat echoes, mirroring the sea
In this melody, together we are free
Hold me closer, let the rhythm draw us near
In this moment, everything is crystal clear
And the stars above, they twinkle in our eyes
Lost in laughter, as the night begins to rise
Time is slipping gently while we sway to and fro
In the dance of shadows where only lovers know
Softly whispered secrets carried by the breeze
