Under moonlit skies, we whisper truths
Our hearts like waves in ocean blues
Stars above in silence sing
We dance eternal, in love's unique lane
Your touch is gentle as morning dew
In your arms, a world so new
Timeless heartbeat
In the night, love's soft glow
A guiding light, forever's song
We softly sing with every breath of air
The love we bring through passing time
Our souls embrace in endless love
We find our place
Whispers of the past do fade
In the present we have made
Each moment shared like falling leaves
In love's shelter our hearts beat
