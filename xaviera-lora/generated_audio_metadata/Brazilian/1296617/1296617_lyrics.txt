Sway palm trees gentle in the breeze (Gentle in the breeze)
Whispering secrets carried overseas (Carried overseas)
Footsteps on the sand making memories (Making memories)
Take my hand we'll live in L .D.
Coffee in the morning fresh and warm
We sit and talk while the days bore
Smiling at the sun breaking through the morning (breaking through the morning)
Life is like this happiness reborn (happiness reborn)
Dancing in the kitchen while we cook (while we cook)
Sharing stories in every little nook (every little nook)
Laughter fills the air like a storybook
Together is the place where we took
Moments in the breeze where we belong
Each note of life flows like a song
In your eyes I see all the reasons strong
Holding me tight right where we belong
