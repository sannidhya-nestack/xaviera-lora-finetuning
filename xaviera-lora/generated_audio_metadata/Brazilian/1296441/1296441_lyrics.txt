The sun peeks through the blinds
A warm breeze dances in
The aroma fills the air
Welcome to our moment
Sip our morning coffee (a gentle start)
Watch the world awake (a brand new part)
Hear the whispering leaves (tatures all night)
Feel the soft sunrise (in our hearts)
Lazy clouds drift by (slow parade)
Birds sing melodies (sing in their place)
Your laughter like a bell
Never faced
Each moment we embraced
Hand in hand
In our little corner
Dreams unfold
Every sip a story
A folding bowl
Together in the silence
Truth be told
Love in every breath
A secret goal
Pages of a book on the windowsill
Memories we write by gentle thrill
The rhythm of our lives soft and still
Hand in hand we hold, time to fear
Underneath the sky, stretching wide
In this quiet dance, side by side
Moments are a treasure, little guide
We just close our eyes, open wide
