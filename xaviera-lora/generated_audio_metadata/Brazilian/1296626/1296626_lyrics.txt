Gentle waves, quiet nights under the moon
Whispers of love in the warm, salty breeze
Let's sway to the rhythm of the sea
Dancing on the shoreline's edge (soft kisses)
With every step feels like a pledge (endless wishes)
Your heartbeat sings with mine (your joy)
Beneath the stars that align (sweet time)
Whisper sweet nothings through the air (tell a phrase)
Moments like these are rare (juries)
Our souls entwined tonight, free flight
Bathed in the moon soft light, pure delight
Strings of the guitar softly play (early as hall)
We sway gently'til the break of day (rhythmic drum)
Your laughter's music to my ears (sweet sound)
Eases the unspoken fears (love profound)
Whisper sweet nothing
