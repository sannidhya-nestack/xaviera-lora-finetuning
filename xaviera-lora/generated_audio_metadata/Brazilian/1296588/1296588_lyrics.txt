When the sun dips low and shadows glow lower
Melodies dance by the ocean's gentle song
Feel the rhythm sway with evening's embrace
In this moment we find our place
Gentle waves upon the shore
Soft, somber steps on the sand
Stars above begin to glow
Hand in hand we understand
Moonlight paints our silhouettes
As we twirl beneath the trees
Every beat a soft caress
Lost in the sweet reverie
Tide rolls in and out again
Palms sway with an easy grace
With each breath the night begins
Steps we take in this warm place
Feel the warmth of somber breeze
Music flowing through our veins
Moments like these we freeze
Savoring our love's refrain
Moonlight paints our silhouettes
Zilzig flowing through our veins
Every beat of soft caress
Savoring our love's refrain
