As the moonlight sways in the sky
Let us drift into whispered melodies
Let the rhythm carry you away
And lose yourself in the night
'Neath the stars we find our way (we find peace)
In the shadows dreams take flight (sun and rays)
Whisper secrets as we sway (as we sway)
Hold me close through the night (in this dance)
Gentle breezes brush our skin (the line)
Echoes of the distant times (endless waves)
Soft notes play on a window (silent song)
Together here we'll buy (eternities)
Let the music fill the air (tiny silence)
Feel the passion in the sound (gentle silence)
Every moment we can share (to give you love)
Move into the magic found (and the tide pools)
And the light flickers in your eyes (to my face)
Move the buff begins to fade (starving veil)
Lost in moments that arise (sweets and bits of rice)
Within this serenade (ice-cold day)
Step by step in the night (soft and warm)
Guiding us beneath the skies (this cold)
Closer in the quiet light (wide and short and short)
