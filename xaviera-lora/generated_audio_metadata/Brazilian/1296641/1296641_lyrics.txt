The sun dips low and the waves hum softly
Let the tide bring you closer to the rhythm of the sea
Swing with the breeze (gentle days)
Let's present the trees (secret gems)
And all the oceans teeth (summer trends)
And the rules as we plead (for stroness)
Stars begin to shine (bright to me)
Moonlight draws a line (silver eyes)
Nights in perfect time (hidden dream)
Dreams forever mine (timeless space)
Hold me by the shore (warm coil)
And all the music pour (pure familiar)
Waves that we adore (no disgrace)
Dragging us for more (nothing less)
Listen to the night
Quiet sound
Everything feels right
Girl we belong
Holding on so tight
All so strong
That shining bright
All night long
Ooh
All night long
Ooh
Swaying with the breeze
Gentle dance
Whispers in the trees
Secret charm
Chilling the ocean's teeth
Solid channels
As we play
Pastoral nights
Stars begin to shine
Nights and waves
Like jaws aligned
Silver hearts
In perfect time
Hidden names
Forever mine
Timeless
Only by the shore
Wrong chorus
Feel the music pour
Cure the maze
Waves that we adore
Distracting us for more, not for less
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Who am I though?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
