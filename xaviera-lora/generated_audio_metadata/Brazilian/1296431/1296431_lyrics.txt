On a moonlit night, we dance in the shadows
With moments that whisper like the gentle waves
Let the rhythm take you where dreams lie
In this timeless serenade
Midnight whispers calling (soft secrets)
The stars are gently falling (heaven's kiss)
In the breeze we're floating
Weightless grey
Hearts in sync and hoping
Endless chase
Underneath the palm trees
Whispered song
Loves the language we speak
Linger long
Waste the twilight hour
Hidden dreams
In sink and hoping endless chase
Underneath the palm trees whispered song
Loves the language we speak lingering long
Embrace the twilight hours hidden dreams
Capture fleeting flowers silent streams
Dance with me'til morning
Hopes we're free
In the moon's adorning
Silver chain
Every step we're weaving
Lifetimes thrown on us
Says we're keeping
Words unsaid
Shadows softly sway (night's caress)
In the night air playing (no regrets)
Crystal skies are gleaming (tears shape)
Lost in endless dreaming (world's unfurled)
Hand in hand we're gliding (seamless flight)
Seas of time we're riding (day to night)
Stars our secret witness (sitter no vow)
Hearts our whispery promises (stop)
