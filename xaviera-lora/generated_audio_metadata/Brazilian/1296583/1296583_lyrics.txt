Beneath the soft glow of the real moon
We sway to the rhythm of a timeless tune
Whispered secrets of the night (dancing shadow)
Gentle breezes left and right (whisper slow)
Stars reflect in your eyes (timeless skies)
Weaving dreams in silken ties (hearts aglow)
Footsteps echo on the sand (warm and kind)
Hand in hand we understand (you and I)
Notes of love surround us (heavenly kiss)
Moments we cannot discuss (in pure bliss)
The old moonlight in your gaze (soft and deep)
All our troubles it relayed (let them see)
Lapping waves, hush their sound, cool and sweet
In this love that we find, thoughts repeat
Smiles exchange with every glance, endless time
Making memories that dance, so divine
And magic blend (shining bright)
Under skies that never end (star-filled night)
Soft is the rhythm of the heart (night and day)
Together and never apart (come what may)
Notes float in the evening air (gentle breeze)
Lost in worlds without a care, ease and peace
