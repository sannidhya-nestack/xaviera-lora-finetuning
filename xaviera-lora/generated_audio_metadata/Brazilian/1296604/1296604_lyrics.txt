Gentle rhythms take us to a place where hearts can dance
Close your eyes, feel the magic
Let the music take its chance
The midnight ocean waves are calling
Feel the night
Soft whispers from the moonlight falling
Soft and bright, dead by day
Feet moving on the sand so lightly
Dance on air
Every step feels just so right without a care
Stars above are winking slowly
Shine so clear, though
Love's melody embraced us closely
Hold you near, dear
Hands intertwined with silent laughter
Touch so true, oh
Moments that last forever after
And you sway with the breeze
Let me hold you never stray
Our hearts beat in this serene view night to day
Lost in our own world of wonder time won't mind
Sway with the breeze and let's wander love so kind
Dawn approaches, bright and tender
Night to light, every kiss a sweet surrender
Hold me tight, in your arms I find my solace
Peaceful glow, every second feels so flawless
Love will grow
We'll grow, sway with the breeze
Let me hold you, never stray
Our hearts beat in this serene view, night to day
Lost in our own world of wonder, time won't mind
Sway with the breeze and let's wander, love so kind
