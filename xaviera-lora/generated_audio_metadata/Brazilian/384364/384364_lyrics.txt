From blue to black may turn the sky
Cool may the rivers run until running dry
Think not tomorrow, hold secure
But if nothing else, know that love will endure
Bright burns, the sun
'Til it grows cold
Then tell me the worth of wisdom and gold
Think not, the road shines clean and pure
But if nothing else, know that love
We'll endure
Star by star
The light will fade
But evening is quiet
I am not afraid
I stand at the river
And know it will dry
But we will go on for you and I
Our love
Know that love will endure
