As the sun fades away and night whispers grow louder
Beneath a blanket of stars we find our lost thoughts
Underneath the lazy moon (soft and low)
Where guitars begin to croon (sweetly true)
We find solace in the night (only now)
Everything will be alright (comforting, soothing)
Shadows dance upon the sand
Holding dreams within our hands
Every step a lovers glance
In this rhythmic moonlight, tribes are burning
Shadows dance upon the sand
Holding dreams within our hands
Every step a lovers glance
In this rhythmic moonlight, tribes are burning
Stars are painted in the sky
Countless hundreds
Realized spirits fly
Drooling
I'm just waiting
Perfect tone is
Casting waves of endless rhyme
Nuts are derringer
Listen to the oceans hither
Whistling softly on a wind
Quiet homing
Echoes of a laughter never end
And the salty evening again
Joy is casting
Catch a whisper from the brinsel plant
There's a tune that aims to plead in trance
She murmurs of the night
We uncover pure daylight, hearts are yearning
Shadows dance upon the sand (fire)
Holding dreams within our hands (true deep)
Every step a lover's glance (slowly)
this rhythmic moonlight tracks (hearts are burning)
Stars are painted in the sky (endless wonder)
As we feel hearts fly (fooling)
Bodies sway in perfect time (moments)
Casting waves of energy
