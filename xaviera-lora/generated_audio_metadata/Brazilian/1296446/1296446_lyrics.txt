As the evening breeze whispers through the trees
Your heart finds rhythm in the calm of a tease
Underneath the stars I sing my tune
Glistening high
Softly swaying to a distant chrome
Hearts in flight
Feel the gentle warmth of moonlit beams
Dreams take flight
Whisper secrets of our twilight dream
Love's delight
Hear the ocean waves with their sweet cries
Eternal dance
Every note, story in disguise
(Take a chance)
Footsteps in the sand, they guide our way
(The last romance)
In the serenade, we find our sway
(They're still in hand)
Embers of the night, they softly glow
(Shadows play)
In our bossa rhythms, feelings flow
(Come what may)
Let the music carry us afar
Lost in moments under every star
When the morning sun begins to rise
Silent promises and tired eyes
Start anew
In the whisper of a tender breeze (Gently blew)
We'll recall these nights with ease (Always true)
Candles flicker softly in the wind (Trails they cast)
Every fleeting shadow turns to grim (Moves so far)
Wrapped within the closeness of our sway (Hold me tight)
Wind ringing in melodies they play (Through them)
Hear the ocean waves with their sweet cry
Eternal dance
Every note a story in disguise
(Take a chance)
Footsteps in the sand they guide our way
(The last romance)
In this serenade we find our sway
(Still in hand)
Embers of the night they softly glow
(Shadows play)
In our boss the rhythms feelings flow
(Come what may)
Let the music carry us afar
(Trolls we pay)
Lost in moments under every star
When the morning sun begins to rise (golden hue)
Silent promises and feelings flow (come what may)
Let the music carry us afar (trails we had)
Lost in moments under every star (hearts behave)
When the morning sun begins to rise (golden hue)
Silent promises and tired eyes
