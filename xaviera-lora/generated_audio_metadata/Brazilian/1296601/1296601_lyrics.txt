Close your eyes, sway to the rhythm of the night
Feel the whispers of the breeze, any troubles drift away
By the sea, under moonlit skies
Catch the stars in your lover's eyes
Every touch makes the moment right
Dancing waves sing their lullaby
Step by step with a quiet beat
Laughter blends with the summer heat (joyful spring)
Parties sink with the distant streets (silent parade)
Whispered words make the night complete (you and me)
Feel the sand cool beneath your feet (time in the sky)
Every glance turns the night so sweet (heavens cry)
Moonlight waltzes with shadows fleet (dance so much)
Moments blown and our hearts complete (you and me)
Let the night gently carry you (softly)
Dreams awaken in colors new (all alone)
Every heartbeat a promise true
Love like this seems so overdue
Feel the sand cool beneath your feet
Every glance turns the night so sweet
Moonlight waltzes with shadows flee
Moments bloom and our hearts complete
Step by step with the quiet beat (night ceremony)
Laughter blends with the summer heat (joyful spring)
Heart beats sync with the distant street (violent parade)
Whispered words make the night complete
Feel the sand cold beneath your feet (as you rest)
Every glance turns the night so sweet (the night falls quiet)
Moonlight waltzes with shadows fleek (so quiet)
Moments bloom and our hearts complete (the bleach)
