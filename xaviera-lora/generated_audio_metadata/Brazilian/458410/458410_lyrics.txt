A stranger on a train
Just a face looking out at the rain
There's no way to be sure
Yet somehow you know how this journey was meant to go
Headlights on the rails light the way into the dark
Asking if you dare to become aware of an upcoming love affair
The conversation starts on a bridge between two lonely hearts
And as the night moves on
You're thinking of how every moment has led to now
When the whistle blows
He just smiles because he knows
You've begun to care
As you climb the stair
To an upcoming love affair
A stranger on a train
Just a face, looking out at the rain
The passing hills and towns
Blow by in a blur as the feelings inside you stir
Rivers rage below wooden trestles as they sway
Danger fills the air with every kiss you share
In this uncertain love affair
