Under the sway of palm trees
Hearts beat to the rhythm of the sea
Let's get lost in whispers of good times
Drifting through golden rays, endless dreams
Soft samba, serenade, moonlight gleams
Under skies where love stays pure and free
Chasing waves of joy, hear them sing
Gentle breezes kiss us as divine
Moments painted in death's colour shies
Whispers in the twilight echoes fade
Lost in each other's light, a soft parade
Feel the sun upon our skin, moldless black
Hold the night where it begins, stars that dwell
Every step a new spin, melody
Endlessly we're swaying, time will tell
Through the night we wander, boundless trail
In this dance together, lost detail
Every whisper softer, secret sail
In the realm of wonder, hearts prevail
Drifting through golden rays, endless dreams
Soft samba, serenade, moonlight gleams
Under skies where love stays, pure and free
Chasing waves of joy, hear them sing
Gentle blue golden rain the streets
Soft summer serenade moonlight gleams
Moonlight gleams
Under skies where love's fair and free
Chasing waves of joy hear them sing
