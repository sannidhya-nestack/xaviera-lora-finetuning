Beneath the sway of palm trees
The rhythm whispers quietly
Let's paint the sky with melodies
Feel the rhythm in the breeze
Walking by the ocean (and so)
Candles in the motion (like us)
Flowers are like a potion (cosmic)
Feeling our devotion (loving none)
Moonlight in the distance (molded dreams)
Whispering persistence (and mystery)
Your touch with insistence (soft and clear)
Promises existence (heartbeats)
Dancing to the blend of (indexes)
Lyrics we append of (you and)
Moments we could send of (ecstasy)
Echoes we attend of (wild and free)
The warmth of twilight's calling (silence and)
Gentle rain is falling (soft and)
Memories are sprawling (lost and found)
Future dreams enthralling (love profound)
Every step in silence (room and shore)
Ripe with world's compliance (heart and crystal)
Find the pure alliance (forevermore)
Diving into science (love we swore)
More light in the distance (golden dreams)
Whispering persistence (endless dreams)
Your touch with insistence (soft and crude)
Promises existence (heartbeats)
Dancing to the blend of (midnight scenes)
Lyrics we have penned of (UN)
Moments we could send of (ecstasy)
Echoes we attend of (wild and free)
On the toilets calling in less
Who and these?
Who and this?
The warmth that we could send oh
Ecstasy
Echoes we attend oh
Wild and free
All those we attend oh
Wild and free
