Wake on the songs of the ocean's tide
These melodies will ride
In the evening's warm embrace
We'll find our sweet place
Walking down the shore of sandy tombs
Where the twilight closes in and exposes
Underneath the sky of stars, fireflies
Our hearts begin to spin, dance in the sky
Whistlers in the air, gentle breeze
Sip the wine, we care for night
Softly strumming chords, serenade
In love's embrace we sway in the light shades
Summer rain falls I, kisses from above
In the twilight's glow, wrapped in warm loves
Every drop a tear on our skin
As our story unfolds, if dreams begin
We sit by the tide, we fall apart
Lost in each other's eyes, forever just us
No words need be spoken, love's true guide
Our spirits intertwined in this night
Summer rain falls like kisses from above
In the twilight's glow, wrapped in warm love
As we drop a tail on our skin
As our story unfolds, it just begins
