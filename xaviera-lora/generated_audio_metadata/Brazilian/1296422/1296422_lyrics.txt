As the sun dips into the sea
Our hearts sway like the breeze
Caught in the gentle rhythm
Let's lose ourselves in this serenity
Strolling down this moonlit avenue
Sweet tranquility
Every wave a whisper just for you
Silent melody
Stars are painting dreams across the sky (soft lullaby)
In your eyes the night is magnified (eternal gaze)
We dance to the sound of the surf
Endless embrace
Footprints marking stories on the earth
Footprints
With every step our souls align
Secret symphony
Time dissolves we've left it behind
Eternal love
Feel the magic in the air (soft, soft line)
Moments we capture so rare
Timeless dream (your hand in mine)
