Golden sand is beneath our toes
Ocean whispers secret prose
Hand in hand the world glow
Timeless love begins to grow
Moonlight dances on your face
In your arms
I find my place
Stars above, they seem to know
Our love's forever, not for show
Eternal kiss, soft and slow
In your eyes, a gentle flow
Hearts entwined, a single vow
Timeless love from then to now
Gentle breeze through palm tree leaves
Every touch my soul believes
Moments drift like falling leaves
Timeless love from then to now
Endless night
We breathe the dawn
Every heartbeat love reborn
Silent promises are drawn
Timeless love were never torn
Eternal kiss soft and slow
In your eyes a gentle flow
Hearts entwined, a single flow
Timeless love from then to now
