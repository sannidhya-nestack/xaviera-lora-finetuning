Summer love, no sooner here than over
Summer love, came to me from nowhere
What a love, sand and sea and laughter came
Mmm, cozy nights, holding hands together
Summer breezes, blowing over Heather
Oh that moon, it was over far too soon
We fell in love, that is too dear, I lost my head holding you near
There was no one could say that it was wrong
Autumn, I find too cold
Winter, no one to hold
Spring comes, much too late
Summer breezes bring good fate
Summer love, I just can't wait
Summer love, no sooner here than over
Summer love, came to me from nowhere
What a love, sand and sea and laughter came
Oh my love, life and its attractions
Summer love, how we took the actions
No regrets, neither of us were to blame
Oh summer love, kisses were so easy, stars above
I remember how you teased me, what a love
When you always called my name
We fell in love
That is too dear, I lost my head
Old and new near
Such is life in summer sun
A summer song
Autumn, I find too cold
Winter, no one to hold
Spring comes much too late
Summer breezes bring good faith
Summer love, I just can't wait
Summer love, no sooner, hill and over
Summer love, came to me from nowhere
Stand and see, our summer song, our song of love
Our song of love
