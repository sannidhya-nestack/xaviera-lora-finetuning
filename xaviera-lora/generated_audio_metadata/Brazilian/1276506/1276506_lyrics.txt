In the deep in the sun we find our way
Where the ocean whispers to the bay
Gentle breezes play a soft refrain
Dancing shadows waltz upon the lane
Let's sway beneath the silver moon
Where hearts like tides are drawn so soon
With every step a tender sigh
We'll chase the stars across the sky
In the quiet hum of twilight's glow
Dreams unfold like petals soft and slow
Hold my hand as time just slips away
In this moment's warmth we choose to stay
Let's sway beneath the silver moon
Where hearts like tides are drawn so soon
With every step a tender sigh
We'll chase the stars across the sky
Let the night unfold our secret tune
Every note a promise pure and true
As the world speaks and whispers low
We'll keep on dancing nice and slow
As the dawn begins to gently rise
We'll find our way through morning skies
With a sweet song to guide us through
We'll chase the stars across the sky
