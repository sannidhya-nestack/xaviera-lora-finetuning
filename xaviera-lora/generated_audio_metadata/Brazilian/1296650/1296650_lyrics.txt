The sound of whispers shadows under moonlight
Stir the dreams that sway and linger
Stars are dancing on the water shimmer bright
Whispers of the sea breeze echo softly sway
Footsteps weave a tale of wonder, sad and cold
Night blooms open to the dark mystic sight
Candles flicker in the window embrace
Breath of jasmine fills the air (sweet perfume)
Hammock hugs the sleepy dreamer (gentle home)
Guitar tunes a soulful murmur (strings of love)
Rhythms of the night alive (fixing heart)
Moon serenades the tranquil sky (silver song)
Echoes of the night report (whispers of)
Heartbeats play a mellow tune (in the dark)
