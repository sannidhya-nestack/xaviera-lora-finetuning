Let the notes sway with ease
Feel the rhythm in the breeze
Let the melodies please
With a sweet and gentle tease
Walking by the morning sea
Sunlight's feeling calm and feeling free
Ocean's dancing shadows on the beach
Gentle whispers only we can hear
Ballet
Swaying softly in the town
With footsteps echo up and down
Jaspy laughter lingers in the air
Nights and moments fleeting but we share
Coffee cups and quiet chat morning
Chasing dreams we're aiming at darling
Breeze that sings through open doors
Sick homes, syncopated hearts in scores
Teen drum
Swaying softly in the town
With footsteps echo up and down
As the laughter lingers in the air
Nights and moments fleeting
But we share a timeless space
Underneath the starry sky (whispered tale)
May you let the night go drifting by (sail on waves)
Waves of wonder in our eyes (oh so soft)
Sun kissed days and moonlit nights (this light)
