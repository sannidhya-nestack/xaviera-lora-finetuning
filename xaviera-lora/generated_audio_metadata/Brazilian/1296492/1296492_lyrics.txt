Like the soft waves carry us
When the sun kisses the sea
In a place where dreams gently sway
Let's lose ourselves in melodies
In the moonlight by the shore, bouncing shadows
We find secrets we adore, hidden smiles
Gentle whispers evermore, softly spoken
Leave us craving and on cold wrinkles we play
The stars are weaving in the sky
Cosmic tapestries
Like a lover's advice
Truthful lies
You and I will never die (eternal heartbeat)
When our spirits unify (endless flight)
In the rhythm of our hearts (syncopated)
