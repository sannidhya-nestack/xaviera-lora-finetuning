It's beautiful at night
When the sun receives from sight
We stroll along the shore
Till we find a cafe door
The mood is magic
We can view the harbor lights
It's like a postcard
And our eyes filled with delight
Having cocktails with Christine
So peacefully serene
The mood is like a dream
The reflections on the bay
Keep on urging us to stay
The mood is magic
We can view the harbor lights
It's like a postcard
And her eyes filled with delight
Having cocktails with Christine
The mood is magic
We can view the harbor lights
It's like a postcard
And our eyes filled with delight
Having cocktails with Christine
Here in St. Augustine
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee deee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
