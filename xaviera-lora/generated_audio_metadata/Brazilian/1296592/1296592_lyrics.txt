Let the rhythm take your soul, feel it deep
Life's a dance we can't control, so swift
Close your eyes and breathe the gold, find peace
In this warmth we'll break the mold, just drift
Under stars, whispers play, moonlight sway
Seabreeze sings its lullaby, so sad
Footprints fade as if to say
Endless way
Dip your toes and kiss the sky
Why not try
Cafe light shadows blend in
Nighttime friend
Words of love on lips so sweet
Heartbeat
Candles flicker thoughts transcend
Timeless trend
In your arms the world retreats
Can't be beat
Gentle waves upon our shore
Evermore
Melodies that make us whole
Your soul
Listen close there's always more
Open door
Flowing with the tide's control
Take the stroll
