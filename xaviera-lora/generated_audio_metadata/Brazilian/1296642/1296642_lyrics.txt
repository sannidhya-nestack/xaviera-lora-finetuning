Under the gentle sway of the Brazilian sun
Where dreams dance and stories whisper
Let me take you on a journey of rhythm, passion and love
Walking on the edge of time
Like a feather
Silhouettes in moonlight wine
Come together
In the breeze hearts align
Soft surrender
You and I forever rhyme
Love's defender
Hold me close beneath the trees
In the twilight
Whispers carried by the seas
Through the night sky
Every touch a new release
Endless high tide
Moments captured memories
Never tongue-tied
We drift on waves of warm delight
Gentle motion
Stars above so pure and bright
Silent devotion
In this city hearts take flight
Boundless ocean
Love's a never-ending song
Emotion
Hands that trace the freedom line
Orbits turn it
Eyes that meet a fate divine
Candles burning
In the night the world unwinds
Mystic yearning
All that's yours is truly mine
A lesson learning
Hold me close beneath the trees
In the twilight
Whispers carried by the sea through the night sky
Every touch a new relief endless high tide
The moments captured memories never tongue tied
