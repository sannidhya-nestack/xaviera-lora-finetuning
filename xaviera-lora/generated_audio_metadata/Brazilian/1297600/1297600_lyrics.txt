In the quiet of the moon's embrace
Whispers linger in the night's soft glaze
Timeless moments carried on the breeze
Hearts entwined like ancient trees
By the sea where dreams gently tread
Love's eternal gift is swift
Stars above light candles in the sky
Soaring high our spirits fly
Timeless love in every heartbeat
In your eyes I find my retreat
Endless echoes in the night
Together we burn so bright
Hand in hand on pathways old
Stories of our love unfold
With every step through golden sands
We write our tale through distant lands
Oceans part and time may wane
But our bond will still remain
In the rhythm of our song
