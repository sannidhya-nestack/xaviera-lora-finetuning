Oh my darling I adore you
You're my one true love
In your gaze you adore me
My heart will stop and start
The darkness turns to daylight
Because you are there
In your presence, suns are melting across the Milky Way
Venus and Mars, oh
Summer of love, oh
Summer of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Summer of love
Zen or it's a art
I love you sure or as you stand
Moon hides its face from your beautiful glance
When you dance the rainbow smiles at your every step
Summer of love is your heart's greatest gift Venus and mine
Summer of love
Oh my darling I adore you, you're my one true love
In your gaze, you're adorning
My heart will stop and start
When you dance, the rainbow smiles
At your every step
Samba of love is your heart's greatest gift
