Sway a bit, the rhythm of a gentle breeze in twilight
Whispers of the heart, dancing with ease under moonlight
By the shore, we walk in silence
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Softly humming nature's guidance
In the sand, in the sand
Echoes of a love so tender
With a sigh in each breath
A sweet surrender as we try
Moonlight paints the sea with silver glowing bright
Stars above our secret river, endless night
In your eyes I see a story deep and vast
Every moment pure and holy, seasons cast
Steps we take in sync together
Side by side
Wandering the world forever
Worlds collide, hmm
Laughter rings like chimes on water
Softly play, hmm
Time stands still, no moment shorter
In the day
Moonlight paints the sea with silver glowing
Bright stars above
Our secret river, endless night
In your eyes I see a story deep and vast
Every moment pure and holy seasons cast
Whispers float from lips so tender
In the dark
Hearts aflame
A love to render
Leave its mark
We embrace the gentle whispers
Forever true
In the breeze
We find our answers
