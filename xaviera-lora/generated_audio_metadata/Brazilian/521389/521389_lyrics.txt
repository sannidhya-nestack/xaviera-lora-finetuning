So what you say, about today
I bet you set my heart on fire
And where you go, I wanna know
Can you feel this burning desire
You bring my heart up to my throat in this pasta serenade
I've got to tell you I'm in love with you
So what you say about the day
I live and dream in all our desires
Our eyes are dancing with the music playing
It's a Boston serenade
I've got to tell you I'm in love with you
And did you know that you would blow my heart wide open like this
I know a charm so take my arm
Our hearts pounding harder with each kiss
I know you know that we must go run away alone at last
Your body's swaying and your eyes are saying
Leave that bastard, serenade
I've got to tell you, I'm in love with you
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
So what you say about the day
