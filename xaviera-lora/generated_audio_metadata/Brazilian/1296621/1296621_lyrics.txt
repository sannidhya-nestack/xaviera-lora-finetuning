Feel the rhythm warm and tender
Like a whisper in the breeze
Dancing softly through the sunlight
Swaying with the palm trees
Sip a morning coffee, a gentle start
Hear the ocean whisper, lovers are
Watch the seagulls gliding, graceful flight
Feel the sand beneath you, a pure delight
Sunset paints the canvas, golden hue
Stars begin to twinkle, a dream come true
Moonlight casts its magic, a soft embrace
Nighttime, silent melody, a timeless space
In the warmth of twilight, soothing grace
Heartbeats sing together, a perfect place
Harmony and laughter, a sweet repose
Capture every moment, a love that grows
Listen to the waves sing calming tunes
Stroll along the shoreline, a walk in June
Breathing in the salt air, fresh recall
Holding hands and smiling, a love enthrall
A gentle snare
A lover's heart
Hit the morning coffee, a gentle start
Hear the ocean whisper, hear the ocean whisper
A lover's heart, a lover's heart
Watch the seagulls glide in a graceful flight, a graceful flight
Feel the sand beneath you, a pure delight, a pure delight
Sunset paints the canvas, a golden hue
Golden hue, stars begin to twinkle
Dream come true, a dream come true
Moonlight casts its magic
Soft embrace, a soft embrace
Nighttime silent melody
Timeless space, a love that's
