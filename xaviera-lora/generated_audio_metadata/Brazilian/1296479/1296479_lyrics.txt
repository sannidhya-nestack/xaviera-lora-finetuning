Under the moon we sway
In the soft night's embrace
A dance of hearts that play
Where love finds its space
Whispering breezes blow (night's glow)
Beneath the stars we know where dreams flow
Guitar strings softly strum birds will hum
We're lost but still at home in love's dawn
Candles flicker and fade like a ray
All worries start to weigh as we fall
We smile under the canopy (just you and me)
In this tranquil harmony (serenity)
Moonlight serenade (nice cascade)
Gentle hands that hold (hearts unfold)
In the rhythm of the sea (you and me)
We find our melody (eternally)
Eyes lock in a game (the world's made)
Silence softly speaks (one heart sings)
In the hush of the night (so right)
We find our guiding light (your beauty)
