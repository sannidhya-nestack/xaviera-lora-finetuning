In the warmth of mellow evenings
We find a gentle breeze
Whispering sweet secrets
In the sway of rustling trees
Underneath the moonlit sky
Let the rhythm glide us by
Soft and subtle wave of time
Dancing hearts in perfect rhyme
Stars are weaving golden blankets
Over shimmering sand
As we trace the lines of footsteps
Where the ocean kissed the land
In beneath the moonlit sky
Let the rhythm glide us by
Soft and subtle wave of time
Dancing hearts in perfect rhyme
Stars are weaving golden blankets
Over shimmering sand
As we trace the lines of footsteps
Where the ocean kissed the land
Laughter floats upon the water
Echoes in the night
Moments caught in a silken light
Fleeting yet so bright
Underneath the moonlit sky
Let the rhythm glide us by
Soft and subtle wave of time
Dancing hearts in perfect rhyme
In the calm of gentle whispers
Dreams and hearts entwine
With each note a tender promise
In this bustle beat of mine
