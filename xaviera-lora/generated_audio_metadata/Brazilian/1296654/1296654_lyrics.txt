Imagine the way gentle and wild as I sing to you
This tune smooth and mild let us sway together just for a while
In the rhythm of bossa nova we find our style
Sea breeze whispers your name softly through
Moonlight dancing by the water
Reflecting pure laughter like a symphony
Holds my hand this moment
I feel truly free in the maze
Footprints left upon the sandy shoreway
Every note a story to explore
In the bed, stars above seem to understand
Twinkle bright when I hold your tender hand
In the maze, oh the sway of all our love divine
Gentle glow, hearts entwined in perfect time
Feel it flow underneath the twilight sky
Endless view, just forever you and I, me and you
Moments linger like a sweet caress (on the breeze)
Soft as kisses, pure finesse (a need to deep)
Your eyes sparkle with a thousand dreams still clear
In every breath your essence gleams, hold you near
Oh, the sway of all our love divine
Gentle glow, hearts entwined in perfect time
Feel it flow underneath the twilight sky
Endless view, just forever you and I
Me and you
