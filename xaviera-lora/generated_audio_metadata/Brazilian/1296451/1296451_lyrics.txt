Dancing waves upon the shore, glimmering bright
Sunsets painting skies with gold, evening delight
Whispers of the ocean song, singing so free
Moments that we can't ignore, eternally
Footprints in the sands of time, fading too fast
Memories with each new rhyme
Forever lasts
Sea ghosts calling in the breeze
Soaring up high
Sweating palm trees with such ease
Reaching the sky
Underneath the moonlit glow
Glowing so soft
Every heartbeat starts to slow
Feeling a loss
Stars align to tell our tale, twinkling at night
Love is more than words can spell, shining so bright
In the rhythm of our hearts, dancing and sing
Life becomes a work of art, paints with each blink
Every molding sparks a smile, glimmering eyes
Captured in this gentle style, never goodbye
Soft embrace of midnight air, whispering sweet
Every breath a lover's prayer, making hearts beat
Tender touch and silent vows, signing so true
Promises that time allows, we always knew
Underneath the moonlit glow, glows our song
Every heartbeat starts to slow, feeling our love
Stars align to tell our tale
