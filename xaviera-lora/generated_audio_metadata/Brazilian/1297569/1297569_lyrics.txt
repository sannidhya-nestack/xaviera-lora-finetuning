Beneath the canopy of stars
We whisper tales no time can mark
Your eyes reflect the moonlit sea
In every glance, serenity
The waves that kiss the golden shore
Our love, it sways forevermore
Through every breeze and whispered word
Your voice, the sweetest song I've heard
Timeless heart, ever true
In your arms, skies stay blue
Held by love, in times old with you
My heart is bold
The sun may rise and seasons change
But in our hearts love will remain main
A gently strung guitar's refrain
With you I'm home through joy and pain
In echoes of a faint past light
Our souls entwine in endless flight
No time or tide can alter fate
With you I'll dream it's never late
Timeless heart, ever true
In your arms, skies stay blue
Held by love, in times old with you
My heart is bold
The canopy of stars we whisper
Tales no time can mar your
