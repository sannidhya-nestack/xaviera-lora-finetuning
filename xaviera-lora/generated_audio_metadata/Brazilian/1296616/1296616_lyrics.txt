The darkness, my secrets, softly spoken
Moonlight dance full of wakes
With every note we sway
Under the twinkling stars
Our footsteps on the sand
Hearts beating in time
Your eyes steal the night
Dreaming of tomorrow
Each breath a melody
We're lost in the rhythm
Love flows like a river
Caught in the harmony
Of endless skies
A breeze that carries tales
Fingers intertwined
Life's endless pleasures
A waltz that never ends
In twilight hues
Laughter echoes softly
Whispers of forever
We cherish these moments
Writing our own ballad
Each breath a melody
We're lost in a rhythm
Love flows like a river
Caught in the harmony
Of endless skies
