In a cafe by the sea
Mellow tunes dance with the waves
Underneath the moonlit sky
We find our rhythm in the night
Sway with me under starlit skies (gentle twirl)
Feel the warmth in our hearts arise
Listen close to a song of tides (whispering)
Every step feels like paradise (magic tricks)
Hold my hand as we take it slow (with my bow)
In the breeze where the palm trees grow (soft and low)
Lost in moments we can't let go (ever so)
Hear the ocean's eternal flow (steady show)
Let the music weave us tight
(Opening dreams)
In the quiet of the night
(Silver peaks)
With a rhythm pure and light
(Clover deeps)
We'll dream until the morning bright
(Silence)
Sunset hues in your eyes I see (lazy day)
Catch our breath with each melody
