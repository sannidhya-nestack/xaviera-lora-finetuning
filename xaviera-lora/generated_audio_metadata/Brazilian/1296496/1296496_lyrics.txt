The scares of a palm tree sway like a lover's fire rhythm of the ocean on the gentle lullaby
Waves and tides you've heard and under moons and bright
Sands slip through my fingertips like a lover's tray
Stars twinkle in the sky, the secrets they confess
Softly singing in the breeze, nature's sweet caress
Sunset paints the sky in healed and glowed arrives
Birds call out in twilight sea where the magic flies
Heartbeats lump into the tune in this rhythmic ride
Feel breeze caressing our cheek on this wild tide
Gentle melodies we weave in nights of kiss
Endless dreams we turn to chains of pure bliss
Together in a dance we stride in tenderness
Underneath the moonlit sky nothing to confess
Footsteps lead us down the shore (whispered steps in sand)
Hand in hand we face the world (guided by the land)
Soft guitars strum our hearts (full and straight, so tight)
Melodies that drift away on our side
Echoes in the cold, we fight in the mist
Songs of love and hope imploding in our midst
Moonlight casts its silver glow on the shores of tonight
Together in the night we know everything feels right
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Gentle melodies we weave (tonight)
Soft kiss in the streams we dare to chase (fulness of your bliss)
Together in a dance we sway (tenderness)
Underneath the moonlit sky, nothing to contest
