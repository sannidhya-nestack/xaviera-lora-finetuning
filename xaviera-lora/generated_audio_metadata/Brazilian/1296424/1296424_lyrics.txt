Pictures of what a quiet beach, the sun setting low
The waves whispering secrets let the rhythm carry you away
Under starry skies, silky shining
Gentle whispers call, oceans whisper
Moonlight guides our way, silver beams
Feel the night embrace, warm and tender
Footsteps in the sand, ever fading
Hearts begin to sway, timeless waltz
Eyes that hold a dream, deep reflections
Lost in endless night, moments capture
Hold me close tonight, sweet surrender
Let our shadows dance, endless echoes
Breathing in the calm, pure serenity
Lost within the song, eternal moment
Hands entwined in love, a silent promise
Words we never spoke, whispering breeze
Moments left behind, gentle traces
Time can never read, hidden places
Every breath we take, soft confession
Every step we find, gentle rhythm
In this world we've made, our creation
Let the music play, endless motion
