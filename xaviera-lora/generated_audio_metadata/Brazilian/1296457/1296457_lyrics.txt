As the sun dips low and the night begins to rise
Let the rhythms of Rio carry us to new heights
Breeze whispers sweetly (under the moon)
Ocean sings softly (porno just two)
Stars start their tango (lighting our way)
Lost in the moment
No words to say
Flowers caress you
Petals of hope
Hearts intertwining
Learning to cope
Dreams float like feathers
Caught in a sigh
Eyes dance together
Lost in the sky
Under the starlight
Gentle and free
Feel the embrace now, just you and me
Melodies weaving, taking us far
Love finds its rhythm, wherever we are
Whispers of laughter, echo the breeze
Night paints a picture, simple and neat
Twilight's a canvas, dreams on display
Hold on to this moment, don't let it stray
Moonbeams are casting shadows so bright
Songs of the evening holding us tight
Feet in the sand now, steps in the night
Memories forming, pure and light
Whispers of laughter
Night paints a picture (simple and easy)
