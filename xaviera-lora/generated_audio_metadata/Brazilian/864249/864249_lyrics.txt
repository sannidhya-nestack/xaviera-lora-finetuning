When I think of you
A fragrance fills my heart
Every time when I whisper your name
The aroma wafts out from my heart
Speaking of you, my words seem to glow
Like fireflies, like fireflies
Dreaming of you, my mind seems to flow
Like flutterbys, like flutterbys
Come hear the butterfly song
Carried on through waves of air
Come hear the butterfly song
Carried on through waves of my touch
When I need you, I touch the rainbow colors in my heart
Then I touch you, the sun bursts into a bouquet of sunshine
Speaking of you, my words seem to glow
Like fireflies, like fireflies
Dreaming of you, my mind seems to flow
Like butterflies, like butterflies
Come hear the butterflies song
Carried on through waves of air
Come hear the butterflies song
Carried on through waves of my touch
Come hear the butterflies song
And carried on the waves of air
Come here to a butterfly song
Carry down the waves of my thoughts
