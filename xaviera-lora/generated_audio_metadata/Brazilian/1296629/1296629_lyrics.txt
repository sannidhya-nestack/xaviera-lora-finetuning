Hear the rhythm of the gentle breeze
Whispering secrets through the trees
Let your worries drift away
In this dance we sway
Waves are calling me
I can't resist, so serene
Underneath the moon in this tryst (tonight's sleep)
Stars above us whisper sweet (twinkling bright)
As we move to our own deep (soft light)
City lights fade in the mist (face hurts)
Hearts that flutter never miss (suggest)
Walking by the shore tonight
Guided by the pale moonlight
In your arms I feel the calm and free
Life's a smooth and simple song of deep
Every step in graceful twilight flow
You and I in perfect time (love show)
Echoes of a distant song (voice hums)
Whispered through the wind so strong (as if from)
Holding on to moments past (in your arms)
In your arms they'll surely last (you'll feel)
Dreams will carry us afar
Underneath the sky's vast stars (so high)
Hand in hand we'll journey on (never part)
Dancing to this endless song (from the heart)
