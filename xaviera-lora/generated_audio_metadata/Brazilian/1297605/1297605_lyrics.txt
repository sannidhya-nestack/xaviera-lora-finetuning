Underneath the silver moon, the night is ours to keep
Your whispers like a gentle breeze, lull me off to sleep
Stars above in silent awe
They watch our love unfold
Timeless feelings in their glow
Stories yet untold
Walking by the endless sea
The waves kiss at our feet
In the sand we trace our lives
Where time and love both meet
Every heartbeat whispers true
A melody so sweet
In your eyes a distant past
A future we repeat
Timeless love, our hearts entwined in dances oh so slow
Everlasting moments there in whispers soft and low
In your arms the world stands still, eternity we hold
In the silence of your kiss, forever's truth is told
Beneath the canopy of dreams where shadows softly play
With each breath we share a soul in twilight's gentle sway
Time may fade, the colors bright, but not the love we weave
In our hearts a fire burns that no one can deceive
Timeless love, our hearts entwined in dances oh so slow
Everlasting moments there in whispers soft and low
In your arms the world stands still, eternity we hold
In the silence of your kiss, forever's truth is told
Beyond the bounds of passing years our story will make
Through the echoes of the past like an enduring chain
Hand in hand we'll face the tide unbroken and serene
In the garden of our love forever evergreen
Beyond the bounds of passing years our story will remain
Through the echoes of the past like an enduring chain
Hand in hand we'll face the tide, unbroken and serene
In the garden of our love forever evergreen
