In the silk light of the moon
We dance under the stars
Every moment feels like June
In your arms I go so far
Beneath the whispering palms
Our love forever grows
With every gentle touch so calm
Like petals from a rose
Timeless is our boundless love
In each breath I find your soul
With the sky and stars above
You make my spirit whole
Your eyes are hailing deep and bright
Where my heart seeks rest
In the morning's tender light
In your love I am blessed
Seasons change yet we remain
Steadfast in the breeze
Through the sunshine and the rain
I love this poetry
True
Timeless is our boundless love
In each breath I find your soul
Like the sky and stars above
You make my spirit whole
