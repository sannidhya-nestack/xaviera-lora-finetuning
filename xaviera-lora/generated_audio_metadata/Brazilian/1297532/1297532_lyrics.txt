We dance beneath the moonlight's gentle glow
Your eyes are seaware and those dreams do flow
The timeless tale that only we can know
In your embrace my heart begins to grow
Whispers soft like feathers on the breeze
Your touch, a lullaby that puts me at ease
Forever bound by love's sweet tender tease
In you I find my heart's eternal peace
Through the sands of time our love will flare
In every sunset I see you there
A love that ages like the finest wine
Forever and always you'll be mine
Stars align above our sacred ground
Love's melody, a softly spoken sound
In your arms, a sanctuary found
With every heartbeat, love's profound
Each morning brings a brand new song for two
A symphony composed of me and you
Timeless ages ever strong and true
Our love is stars in sky and morning dew
Through the sands of time our love will fare
In every sunset I see you there
A love that ages like the finest wine
