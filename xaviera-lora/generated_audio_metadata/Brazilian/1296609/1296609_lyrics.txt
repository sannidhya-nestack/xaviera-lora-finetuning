In the gentle flow of the tides, where whispers of love blend with the sound of the leaves, a melody of hearts floats across the ocean
Under moonlit skies, softly singing
We dance to midnight's glow
Hearts are ringing in the rhythm of our souls
Love is swinging, whispers fly on breeze
Timelessly clinging, stars above us gleam
Lightly blinking, your eyes light the sea
Deeply leaking
In the glow of twilight
Love's unblinking
Hearts in harmony
And softly ticking
Feel the gentle waves
Soothing motion
Like lovers
Tender care
Devotion
In this flow of time
Soothing motion
Our love will always shine
Motion's potion
Sunrise paints the night, dreams unfolding
Your hand in mine so tight, warmly holding
In the echoes of dawn, story told in
We find our love reborn, hearts emboldened
The tides may rise up tall, uncharted
But all our love will stay tightly guarded
In the whispers of the ocean, hearts uncharted
With each wave we sway, never parting
