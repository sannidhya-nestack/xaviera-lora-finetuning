Under mullet skies, we're whispers sing
Gentle chords and tales that swing
Rich with stories old and new
Let's dance tonight under this view
Walking slow through the city's gleam
Golden street
Lost in shadows of a dream
Silent beat
Footsteps echo in the air
Secret flame
Each step taken with care
Love's repair
Heart to heart we sway and bend
Timeless train, in this dance'til night's end
Shadows play, softly whisper all our thoughts
Gentle love, find true love in tiny knots
Never lost
Stars above like diamonds shine in their heart
Leaving tails through every line
Sweets of life
Breathing softly, feeling light
Magic's mine
In your arms through the night
Perfect hiding
In the rhythm we can fight, endless strife
Go run make it, worlds collide, dreams get wild
Eyes that glimmer with the sound, lost and found
Two souls floating off the ground, magic's bound
Heart to heart, we sway and bend
Timeless train in this dance'til night's end
Shadows blend, softly whisper all our thoughts
Gentle thoughts, find true love in tiny knots never lost
