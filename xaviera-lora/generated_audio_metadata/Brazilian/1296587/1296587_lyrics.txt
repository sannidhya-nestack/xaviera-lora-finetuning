Ladies and gentlemen, close your eyes
Feel the gentle waves of twilight
Let the rhythm take you away
To a place where dreams softly sway
Underneath the silver moon (glancing skies)
Whispers float across the dunes (soft goodbyes)
Stars are winking in the night (secret dreams)
Hearts are sharing quiet light (golden beams)
We're adrift on ocean song (gentle breeze)
Time is slow but night is long (memories)
Tides are drawing us within (timeless tides)
Lost between the now and then (masked in line)
In your eyes I find a place (clouded seas)
Shelter from the storms embrace (calm and peace)
Every word you softly speak (lightened sighs)
Echoes through my heart's mystique (midnight drives)
Magic lingers in the air (silent tunes)
Love's a whisper we both share (holly moon)
Moments flow like gentle streams (missful hazes)
Through the canvas of our dreams (warm embraces)
In your eyes I find a place (velvet seas)
Shelter from the storms and rains (love and peace)
Every word you softly speak (uttered sighs)
Echoes through my heart's mystique (midnight dries)
