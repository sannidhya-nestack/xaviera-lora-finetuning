In the glow of dusk and dawn
Whispered kisses linger on
Your touch like waves upon the shore
A love that time cannot ignore
Beneath the shade of ancient trees
Our laughter dances with the breeze
Eyes that speak in silent tongues
A love as old as songs unsung
Timeless hearts, a rhythm pure
In your embrace I find my cure
A melody that spans the years
A symphony that calms my fears
Stars above have watched us grow
Through every high and every low
In their light our stories told
A love that will not fade or fold
With every heartbeat we confess
This love that words cannot express
Our souls entwined forevermore
A love that time cannot ignore
Timeless hearts, a rhythm pure in your name
