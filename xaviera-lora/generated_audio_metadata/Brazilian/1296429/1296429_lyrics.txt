Let your heart sway to the whisper of the moonlight
Feel the rhythm of the night embracing your soul
Let the waves of melody carry you away
In this dance of love and dreams
Underneath the stars we wander (in twilight)
Holding hands we drift asunder (in twilight)
Whispers of our love grow fonder (so dream on)
Hearts entwined in secret wonder (together)
Mystic night with whispers softly (so tender)
Every step our souls are lofty (ascending)
Glimmering eyes and moon shine croftily (forever)
With each touch our love is lofty (bender)
Dance with me through midnight's grave (its shadowing)
Feel the heartbeat of this place (as it follows)
In our footsteps find embrace (no sorrow)
Tangle with me face to face (till dawn)
With the dawn we'll leave the night
Trading stars for morning light (slow glisten)
But in dreams we'll reunite (with kisses)
In this dance of endless flight (true vision)
In the moonlit tango sway (together)
Melodies our hearts are playing
