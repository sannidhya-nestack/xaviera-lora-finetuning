Busted a slope, named the man for jazz
In beaches where waves dance and dreams float
Whispered secrets in the breeze, it calls me
Golden sands beneath our feet, silver balls
Moonlight spools of silken thread, over the trees
Gentle murmurs from the sea (nature's song)
Stars align in cosmic walls (in this world)
Shadows sway in twilight songs (like in races)
Lovers' whispers fill the air (sweet confessions)
Palms are swaying side by side (nature's rhythm)
In your eyes a world unfolds (hidden treasures)
Touch that lingers like a breeze (soft caress)
Every heartbeat, every sigh
Endless, timeless with you
I have found my home
Endless journey
Footprints left upon the shore
Trace our story
Waves erased but we remain
Everlasting
Promises in every tug
Stoking vows and castles of liquid gold
Built together
In your eyes a world unfolds
Hidden treasures
Touch that lingers like a breeze
Soft caress
Every heartbeat, every sigh (echoes timeless)
With you I have found my home (endless journey)
