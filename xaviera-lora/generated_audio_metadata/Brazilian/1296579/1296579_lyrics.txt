Under the amber sky, as the last light fades
We gather here, in the dance of the waves
Let the rhythm flow, like whispers in the air
Feel the magic in every moment we share
By the shore we sit
Watching seagulls fly
Gentle breezes kiss
Salty tears goodbye
In the evening glow
Time slows to a crawl
Whispers of the night
As the shadows fall
Stars begin to shine
Like diamonds above
Chords of life entwine
Scripted in our love
Footprints in the sand, waves erase their trace (it's just gray)
Holding to your hand, tenderness embraced (science)
In the twilight haze, melodies entwine (it's lost)
Lost in this amaze, where the hearts combine (every chance)
