Under twilight skies we sway
Whispers dance in evening's play
Every heartbeat seems to say
Time with you just melts away
Gentle waves on moonlit shore
Silent promises we swore
You and I forevermore
Love's an open, endless door
Timeless love in every glance
In your eyes, a wistful dress
Eternal as the stars' romance
In your arms my heart finds rest
Sunrise glow upon your face
Morning dew in our embrace
With you life's a sweet slow pace
Bound by love's tender grace
