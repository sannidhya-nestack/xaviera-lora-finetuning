Eyes like twilight (in the night)
Soft kisses on my cheeks (gentle touch)
Whispers like the breeze (soft and sweet)
In the arms of dreams (where we meet)
Dancing through the dark (so we run, smell me climb)
Melodies in the air (steer us tight)
Footsteps in the sand (fading path, path in path)
Lost in loves embrace (where we stand)
Stars above us hum (silent song)
Waves caress the shore
Underneath the pond (secret shade)
Lifted by our hearts, unprepared
Candles flicker bright (shadows play)
Laughter in the dark (a beautiful sway)
