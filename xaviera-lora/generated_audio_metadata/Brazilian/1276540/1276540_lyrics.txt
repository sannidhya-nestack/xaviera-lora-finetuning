At the gentle sway of evening tides
Whispers call where the breeze resides
Golden shadows in the fading light
Paint a dance on the edge of night
Softly, softly we glide along
Where the sea sings a lullaby song
Under moons embrace, hearts entwined
We leave the world behind
In the cooling air of whispered dreams
Footsteps melt like flowing streams
Stars like kisses on the ocean's crest
With every sigh we're the last
Softly softly we glide along
Where the sea sings a lullaby song
Under moon's embrace
Hearts entwined, we leave the world behind
Look at the world with gentle eyes
Feel how the moments harmonize
In the silence that the night bestows
Love melody grows
And in this magic of the night
We'll hold on'til the morning light
Softly drifting in the dawn's caress
In waves of tenderness
