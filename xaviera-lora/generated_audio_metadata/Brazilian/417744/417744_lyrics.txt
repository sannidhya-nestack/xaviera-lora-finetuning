I don't feel like talking
I don't wanna see you
I just feel like dancing alone, alone
I don't want nobody
No arms around you
No words to convince me I'm wrong
Leave me alone, all right alone
I don't want no one around me
Leave me alone, I feel so strong
Wanna dance alone without you
I do it like a token
I don't want to shake you
I just feel like dancing alone
I don't want nobody
No arms around me
No words to convince me
I'm wrong
Leave me alone
All right alone, I don't want no one around me
Leave me alone, I feel so strong
I wanna dance alone without you
Oh yeah, mmm
Oh no, yeah
Leave me alone, all right alone
I don't want no one around me
Leave me alone, I feel so strong
I wanna dance alone without you
I don't feel like talking
I don't want to see you
I just feel like dancing alone
I don't want nobody
No arms around me
No words to convince me
That I'm wrong
I'm wrong, leave me alone
All right alone
I don't want no one around me
Leave me alone
I feel so strong
I wanna dance alone without
Without you
Shut up again
I wanna
I wanna live without you
Oh no no no
Without you
Oh oh oh
Without you
Without you
Live for me
No no no no
No no no
Without you
I don't wanna dance alone
I wanna dance alone without you
Shoot it up, shoot it up, yeah
Leave me, leave me alone without you
I wanna live it, I wanna live it, I wanna live it
I wanna live without you
I wanna live without you
I wanna live without you
