Are you thinking what I'm thinking
That would be so nice
Let's et about
Stepping out on this rainy afternoon
We could sit by the fire
Or make some fire of our own
And listen to the rain
Tap against that window pane
We don't care
We don't care if it never ends
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
On this rainy afternoon
Let the world outside rain till it's satisfied
Cause we're not going anywhere
We're not going anywhere
We're not going anywhere on this rainy afternoon
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
On this rainy afternoon
Let the world outside rain'til it's satisfied
we're not going anywhere
We're not going anywhere
We're not going anywhere on this rainy afternoon
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
