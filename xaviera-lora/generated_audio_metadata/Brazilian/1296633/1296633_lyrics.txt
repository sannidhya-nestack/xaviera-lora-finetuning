Hunger of the mellow, moonlight we drift
Soaking in the charm of a sun over lies
That set our hearts free
In the soft summer night (this version)
We find peace in our hearts (gentle stream)
Dancing under the stars (this is for you)
Love flows like the breeze (see set me free)
Your gaze is a poem
Silent wind, lost in timber moving
Its night skin laughter fills the air
Purest glitter, our souls intertwine
Lovely twill, we'll swim in the night
Ocean deep, moonlit night
Waves will guide (hearts to kiss)
Serenade of life (sweetest we)
Together we'll ride (a love so steep)
Listen to the waves (timeless dream)
Rhythm of our love (heaven's sea)
Every beat's a promise (so discreet)
In each other's arms (so complete)
Morning brings a sigh (future breath of magic remake)
(Your delight will hold me for a while)
(In the light)
Whisper sweet nothings (day and night)
Morning brings a sigh, future but the magic remains, purity will hold me for a while
