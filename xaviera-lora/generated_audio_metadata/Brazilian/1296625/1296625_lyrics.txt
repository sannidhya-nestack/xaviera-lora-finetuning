Silparu, such a short and tingle
Centipede, dancing in the sand
Rifty coast, soft guitar
Strings play the air, mellow tunes
Lovers meet in twilight glow, hidden smiles
Lay your heart into my hand
Trust the feel, the warmth between our skins
Close and dry, stars above us, softly shine
Silent grey, voice like velvet wraps my mind
Say the lullaby, moonlight weaves through tangled winds
Golden thread, whispers fill the gentle breeze
Jersey coast, come stand still as worlds collide
Frozen winds, we are lost within this night
Chanted by
Beneath this canopy of dreams (grand and fair)
Every moment stings and floats (dressed to the lips)
In your eyes, eternal gleams, bell-less views
Together in this dance, we grow hair that spews
Lay your heart into my hand
Trust the flow
Feel the warmth between our skin
Close embrace
Stars above us, softly shine
Silent grace
A voice like velvet wraps my mind
Sweet lullaby
Moonlight weaves through tangled limbs
Golden thread
Whispers fill the gentle breeze
Jersey clouds
Stand still as worlds collide
Frozen wind
We are lost within this night
Enchanted by
In me, this canopy of dreams
Glimpse and view every moment spins and flows
Churns to bliss
In your eyes, eternal glints
Frownless feels
We are lost within this dance
We grow, hold me closer with each beat
Hidden part, every breath a symphony
Purest art, in this song
We are complete
Melody in harmony, play your part
