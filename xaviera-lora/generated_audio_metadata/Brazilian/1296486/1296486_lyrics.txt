As the moonlight drips like honey on the sea
Let the whispers carry dreams to you and me
Beneath the stars we dance slow (well of the dawn)
Feel the night embrace our glow (sweetly sung)
Waves kiss the shore so softly (whispers close)
In your eyes the night unfolds (gently goes)
Tides play the strings of our fate (magic beat)
Sand beneath our feet feels like memories keep
Soft lullabies in the breeze, dreams we own
Hand in hand our hearts at ease, never alone
Moonlight paints our love in gold (feel me dance)
Whispers through the air untold (night's romance)
Nature's symphony so true (ocean song)
Lost in rhythm, me and you (all night long)
Stars twinkle, secrets in the sky
Moments pass but love won't die
Eternal night
Hold me close'til the dawn
Sunlight kiss
Every second love reborn
Endless bliss
Midnight sails on gentle waves
Silent face
Hearts beat in this moonlit case
