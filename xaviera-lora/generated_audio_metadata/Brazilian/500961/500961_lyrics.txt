What if you fall into a warm bath of love soup?
And as you lie there sated, the soup cools
Conch shells catches you in its clummy vegetable grasp
What if you fall into a warm bath of love soup
And as you lie there sated the soup cools, congeals
Catches you in its clammy vegetable grasp
What if you fall (what if you fall) into a warm bath (into a warm bath) of love soup?
And as you love it, say it'til the soup cools, congeals
Catches you in its calming vegetable grasp
Vegetable grass
Vegetable grass
