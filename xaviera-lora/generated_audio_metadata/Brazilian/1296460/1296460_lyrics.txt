Under the Brazilian moonlight
A melody whispers through the night
Let the rhythm guide your soul
Waves kiss the shore (so gentle)
Stars light the sky (so brilliant)
Hearts beat as one (so true)
Love's sweet embrace (so timeless)
Dreams float on air (so free)
Laughing with you (so pure)
Lips meet in bliss (so tender)
Eyes locked in love (so deep)
Dance to the breeze (so cool)
Sway with the trees (so calm)
Feel every note (so smooth)
Sing with the night, so bright
Whispers of stars, so near
Echoes of sea, so wide
Footsteps in sand, so soft
Nights never end, so sweet
Hearts paint a song (so vivid)
Souls find their tune (so full)
Under the moon (so cold)
