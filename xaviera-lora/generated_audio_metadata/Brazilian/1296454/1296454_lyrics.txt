Step into the moonlight where whispers dance with waves
Let the rhythm cradle you soft as Saturn's embrace
A gentle breeze plays notes off the sea's quiet stage
And everything you long for lies within this place
Moonlight kissing gold shimmering
Footsteps in the sand, a lover's strand
Taste of solvent, sweet memories be
Heartbeats write the song, where you belong
Where you belong, stars become our guide
The oceans tide, waves that softly hum
Where dreams come from, eyes that speak in code
The night is faint
Hand in hand we sway, shadows play
Time slows down for us, beyond the thoughts
Quiet pauses say, a whispered tale
In this tender light, in this tide
Whispers of the sea, you and me
Every breath a beach, within our reach
Laughter on the breeze, our hearts at ease
In the night we found a sacred ground
Souls that intertwine in rhythms line, in rhythms line
Sway with the palm, our favorite song
Whispering winds of change, never strange
Moment after moment, love's own comments
In blue overnight, blue and bright
Where you belong
Stars become our guide
And oceans tide
Waves that softly hum
Where dreams come from
Eyes that speak in code
The night is stage
Hand in hand we swear where shadows play (where shadows play)
Time slows down for a leon, the fuss, ah it pauses, sail, a whispered tale
In this tender light (in this tender light) whispers of the sea, you and me
