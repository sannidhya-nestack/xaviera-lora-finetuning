I, I, I gotta get close to you
I, I, I gotta get close to you
You're looking so fine, so damn relaxed, boy, you got me laid out
You're so laid back, better get my things together
I'm back'cause you got me tripping
I can't feel my feet anymore
I don't know what my body's for
If it's not being close to you, you're all I wanna do
Oh, you're looking so fine
You're so damn relaxed, boy
You got me laid out'cause
You're so laid back and
Better get my things together and
Start to pack'cause, boy, you got me trippin'
I, I, I
I gotta get close to you
I
Eyes, oh I gotta get close to you
I
I, I, I gotta get close to you
I, I, I, oh I gotta get close to you
(I'm, I'm, I'm dead, dead)
