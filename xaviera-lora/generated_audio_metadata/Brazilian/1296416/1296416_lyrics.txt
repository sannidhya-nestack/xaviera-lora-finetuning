Gentle waves of a love-ish breeze
Soft notes dancing through the trees
Catch the scent of sweet leaves
In this summer's timeless ease
Morning light on sandy shores (cold)
Footsteps trace what love explores (hears them)
Seagulls laugh as we adore the sky
Found by dreams forevermore
Gentle whispers in the warm night air
Softly
Love's embrace beyond compare
The stars align without a care
Hearts suck
Summers kiss a perfect pair
More than we got
Oceans edge our story signs
Fingers touch as hearts intertwine (Whispers the)
Every look a poet's line (Crystal deep)
Mapped in stars our paths align (Romorphine)
Cooling breeze our skin it grays (Lover's black)
Moon's reflection hearts encase (Senses)
Joined in moments lovers trace in the back
Endless love our time embraced in dawn's first sight
Whispers in the warm night air
