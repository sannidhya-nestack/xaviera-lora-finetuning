Sun sets off, he paints the sky (brilliant hue)
Gentle waves whisper secrets (oceans new)
Palm trees sway in time's embrace (gentle dance)
Whispered dreams in twilight's glow (chance romance)
Golden sand beneath our feet (warm and fine)
Melodies of distant shores (our souls collide)
Soft caress of evening breeze (love's first kiss)
In the shadows hearts collide (tranquil bliss)
Moonlight serenades the night (silk and peace)
Stars ignite the velvet sky (red)
Every note a tender touch (soft and brave)
In this moment we are found (time has moved)
Jazz guitar sweet melody (taste)
Wine's perfume on lovers lips (hit)
City lights, a soft caress (purple glow)
In the air, the magic lips (turn those)
Eyes that speak without a word (silent song)
Hands that hold the world within (right or wrong)
Promises of whispered nights (endless flame)
In our hearts the rhythm beats (all around us)
Moonlight serenades the night (silken beam)
Stars ignite the velvet sky
Every note, the tender touch (soft and brave)
In this moment we are found (time flies fast)
