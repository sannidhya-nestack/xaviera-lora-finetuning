Saw your shadow in the fading light
Your eyes like flames, igniting the night
A single glance set my soul on fire
Whispered dreams and fueled desire
Dance with me beneath the moon so rare
Feel the rhythm in the heated air
Every heartbeat a soft serenade
A melody of love that we secretly made
Your laughter curls like smoke in the breeze
The sombre of life, a moment to seize
We speak in touches, no words to define
The language is ours, body and mind
Palm trees sway to our shared devotion
The tide that rises with every emotion
Echoes of waves that soft and bore
In this paradise I yearn for more
Palm trees sway to our shared devotion
A tide that rises with every emotion
Echoes of waves that soft and bore
In this paradise I yearn for more
In this paradise I yearn for more
