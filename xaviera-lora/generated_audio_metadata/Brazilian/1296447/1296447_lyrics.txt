Under solid skies where shadows sleep
Melodies whisper through the night
Dancing with the night in secret
Moonlight guides our flight so tender
Whispers in the air, softly spoken
Hearts without a care, forever broken
Eyes that never lie, mystic glance
Reasons go awry, one last chance
Hands in gentle hold
Stories left untold
In our minds unloved
A fleeting dream
Beyond the broad and silver gleam
Moonlit moments that we chase
Keep fastened in this timeless space
Where we wait
Breathing in the sound
Harmonize
Lost and then we're found
No disguise
Notes in perfect time
Then calling
Rhythm so divine
Serenade
Footsteps in the sand
Whisker low echoes of the band
Softly flowing
