Feel the warm breeze in the Gulf of Copacabana
Whispers of Rio float on the salty air
Together let's dance to the rhythm of love
Feel the heartbeat of the city merge with ours
Golden sand beneath our toes
Surf serenade
Moonlight paints a silver glow
Night's soft cascade
Laughter mingles with the tide
Waves gently sway
Whisper secrets on the breeze
Rio suite way
In the twinkle of the stars
Heaven's align
Every kiss a shooting star
Yours and mine
Underneath the palm tree shade (the dreams intertwine)
Love as endless as the sea (hearts combine)
Sip the wine by candlelight (time's tender kiss)
Hold you close under the sky (it's full of bliss)
Somber rhythms in our heart (kindness and pure)
Every moment feels like art (love's perfect cure)
Hear the city come alive (night soft)
Parade
Shadows dance along the deal of serenade
Footsteps echo in the dark
Mystical song
In this magic we're a spark
Forever strong
In the twinkle of the stars
Heaven's align
Every kiss a shooting star
Yours and mine
Underneath the palm tree shade (dreams intertwine)
Love as endless as the sea
Heed the wand by candlelight (fling this tender kiss)
Hold you close under the sky (this full abyss)
Somber rhythms in my heart (timeless and pure)
Every moment feels like art (four pump vibes)
