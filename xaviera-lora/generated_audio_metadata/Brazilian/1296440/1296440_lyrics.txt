The moon kisses the sea in twilight dreams
Rio whispers softly in the night breeze
Listen closely to the rhythm so sweet
Feel the heartbeat of this city complete
Underneath the silver sky, dancing glow
Softly hums a lullaby, gentle flow
Steps that go on cobblestone, whisper low
In the night I'm not alone, magic show
Stars are blinking with delight, sparkling gems
Gentle waves in moon soft bite, night time hands
Every breath a peaceful sight
In this city life feels right, soft diadems
Cafe lights and laughter bright, warm embrace
Twinkling eyes and starry night, timeless space
Guitar sings a lover's plight, sweetest grace
Love and music intertwined, lost in chase
Stars are blinking with delight, flickering flames
