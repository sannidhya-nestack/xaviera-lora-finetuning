It's a garden of delight
Filled with exquisite sights
Sunny days and balmy nights
And the ocean breeze keep me feeling alright
In this tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
No one here is watching the clock
They are living outside the box
Music flows, rhythm rocks
They don't wear no shoes'cause they don't own no socks
In this tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
So swing on down for the winter time
You can sleep in a hammock, it's all on my dime
Living is easy and the water's fine
And we'll be giants here in our own mind
And it feels so nice, tropical paradise
And it feels so nice, tropical paradise (Here in tropical paradise)
And it feels so nice, feels just right (It feels so nice, feels just right)
Platano beans and rice (And it feels so nice to know)
Tropical paradise (Today you'll be with me in paradise)
It's a tropical paradise (paradise)
It's a tropical paradise (paradise)
Montaña de arizo
Somehow we just gotta go
It's a tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
Hay mango, el coco y guayaba
Hay mango, el coco y guayaba
Tan rico el sabor
It's a tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
You can't beat the price
Hay mango, el coco y guayaba
Hay mango, el coco y la guayaba
El tambidu se tumelao, tumelao
Tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
Tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
Tropical paradise, it's a tropical paradise (Have another slice and don't think twice)
Tropical paradise, I'm on it so ('Cause today we'll be together in paradise)
Tropical paradise, I'm on it so (It's a tropical paradise)
Tropical paradise, montagne de chat (It's a tropical paradise)
Tropical paradise, I'm on it so (Tropical paradise, I'm on it so)
It's a tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
Tropical paradise
It's a tropical paradise
