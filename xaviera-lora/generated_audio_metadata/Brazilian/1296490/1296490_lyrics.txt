Gentle waves on sandy shores
Soft breezes whisper secrets
Underneath the stars we dream
Lost in rhythms of the night
Moonlit nights with silver charms
Dancing shadows play along (fell in deep)
Feel the warmth it wraps around (into cocoons)
In the sleepy, sultry aches (spurs)
Watch the palm trees sway and bend (face far)
To the music of the wind (soft embrace)
Every note a secret shared like a friend
In the quiet we are free for time
Tell me dreams you wouldn't dare swallow
In the calm we find our place
Every star a silent weight
In the night our hearts entwined
