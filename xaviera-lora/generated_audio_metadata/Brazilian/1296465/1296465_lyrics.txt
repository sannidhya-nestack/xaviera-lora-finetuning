In the heart of Rio where the sun gently glances the ocean
The rhythm of life dances in a timeless motion
Feel the breeze, let it whisper our sweet devotion
Come along and sway to this magical potion
Morning light shines softly (golden beam)
As the waves kiss the shore (silent dream)
Gentle rhythms waking (where we've been)
Love song forevermore we (both dream)
Footsteps on the sand (echo there)
Holding hands so tight
Beyond compare
Whispers of the sea
Midnight prayer
Our hearts in unity
With both care
Rio's tides are calling
Come with me
Underneath the moon
By the sea
Dancing with the stars
Wandering free
Lost in our embrace
You and me, palm trees sway above
Endless skies in the warmth we pass
Paradise, every note we hum
Sweet surprise in the moonlight's glow
Love's reprise, our song forever is perfect
With every gentle wave, afternoon
Fingers intertwined, not too soon
In this bossa nova groove, gentle swoons
Footsteps on the sand, echo there
Holding hands so tight
Beyond compare
Whispers of the sea
Midway prayer
Our hearts in unity
With both care
Rio's tides are calling
Come with me
Underneath the moon in my eyes
See, dancing with the stars
Walk loud and free
Lost in our embrace, you and me
