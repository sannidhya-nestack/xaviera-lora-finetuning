Under the moonlight, gentle sway
Whispers in the breeze carry the echoes of bossa nova's rhythm
Poetry in motion, let the words dance
Soft nights and city lights, just magic
A gentle rhythm flows, melody divine
Oceans whisper close, seas promise
In every wave that shows, nice rhyme
Silver stars above, endless dreams
Embrace your tender glow, lovers charm
In the twilight's friendly haunt, sweet tunes
A serenade of old timeless songs
Let your spirit fly, wings of hope
To the sunless charm, forever free
Through the night we'll ride, moonlit paths
In the starry sea beyond the dark
Gentle hands touch softly
Fingers play with the dancer's grace
Hearts in tune, music in the air, breath
Of life, love in quiet pace
Deeply swoon, whisper silken dreams
Silent wish, moments pure as gold
Time stands still, in your eyes I see
Worlds unknown, stories yet untold
Hearts reveal
Silver stars above, endless dreams
Embrace your tender glow, lover's charms
In the twilight's friendly haunt, sweet tunes
A serenade of old, timeless songs
Let your spirit fly, wings of hope
To the sunless charm, forever free
Through the night
We'll ride, moonlit path in the starry sea
Beyond the dark
Beyond the dark
Beyond the dark
Beyond the dark
Gentle hands touch softly
Thither dancers grace
Hearts in tune, music in the air
Breath of life, love in quiet pace
Deeply swoon
