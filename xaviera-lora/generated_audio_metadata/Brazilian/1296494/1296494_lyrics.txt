As the sun dips low
And the waves kiss the shore
Let the melodies of the evening carry you away
In the twilight now (and stars in the night)
I see your eyes glow (reflecting gleam)
Your laughter echoes softly (in the breeze)
On a dance under moonlight (a secret song)
Whisper through the palm trees (sweet and slow)
Our footsteps on the sand (leaving a trace)
Hearts beating to the rhythm (of the night)
Love wrapped in soft youth (of twilight gold)
We sway to ocean's lullaby (soft embrace)
As night blooms around us (cool and calm)
The city's lights twinkle (far and near)
Your hand in mine steady (electric touch)
Silent promises (in shared glances)
Future tales we weave (unspoken words)
Omens gently draped (in serene warmth)
The world fades away (just you and I)
Whisper through the palm trees (sweet and slow)
Our footsteps on the sand (leaving a trace)
Hearts beating to the rhythm (of the night)
Love wrapped in soft heat (of twilight gold)
Whispered through the palm trees, sweet and slow
Our footsteps on the sand, leaving a trace
Hearts beating to the rhythm of the night
Love wrapped in soft hue of twilight gold
