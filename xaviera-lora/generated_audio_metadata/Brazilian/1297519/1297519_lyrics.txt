In your eyes I see forever's light
Whispered secrets in the cool twilight
Sunsets paint all memories gold
Hand in hand their stories unfold
Moonlight dances on an endless sea
Love's soft lullaby just you and me
Time moves gently with the lover's grace
Moments linger in our warm embrace
Timeless love forever true
In your arms I've come to view
Eternal whispers gentle as rain
Heartbeats echo love's sweet refrain
Silent stars weave tales of yore
Promises sealed on a distant shore
Waves of laughter ripple through the night
Love's pure essence, a guiding light
Seasons change but we remain
