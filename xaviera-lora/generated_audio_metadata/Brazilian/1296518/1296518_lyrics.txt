Under the stars, by the shore
We find a fading light
With whispers in the night
The rhythm takes its flight
The moonlight dances (the sun)
Upon the waves it glances (as holes)
In the air we breathe
(My dreams are such)
Life's a dream beneath
(My dreams are such)
In the heart of Rio
(In the heart of Seoul)
Echoes softly flow
(They're all around)
With every step we take
(Our lovers leave)
In the land of waves
(No room for sleep)
The streets are filled with laughter (a timeless cheer)
Moments that we capture (we hold them dear)
In the twilight hour (a whispered fade)
Every blooming flower (rolls my eyes)
Echoes softly flow (We're all around) with every step we take (A lover's leave) in the land of waves (A room for sleep)
Hand in hand we wander (in vain times)
Every sight we ponder (in crafted rhymes)
With eyes that tell the story (in silent hues)
Of fleeting mornings
