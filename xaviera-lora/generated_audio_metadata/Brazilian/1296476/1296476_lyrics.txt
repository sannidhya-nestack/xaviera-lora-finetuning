Angels, the people dancing with the night
Moonlight creeping, whispers in the breeze
Soft and subtle, magic fills the air
Let the rhythm take you somewhere new
Stars are winking, paint into the blue
Hearts are singing, feeling so true
Feet are moving, under the sky
All is grooving, no need to try
Gentle shadow, play on the wall
Moments gather, hear the night call
Timeless echo, cheer through the night
Softly swaying, all feels so right
Breathe the rhythm, let it unfold
Feel the magic, let it take hold
Life is fleeting, like grains of sand
Cherish moments, hold someone's hand
Breathe the rhythm, let it unfold
Feel the magic, let it take hold
Life is fleeting like grains of sand
Cherish moments, hold someone's hand
Morning whispers laugh at the sun
Dreams are calling, next work is done
Beating hearts now find their own way
Love now lingers day after day
Steps sinking, our cobblestone
Eyes glinting, never alone
Heart's dancing, syncopated time
Love is fancy, getting both so right
