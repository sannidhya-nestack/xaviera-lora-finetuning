This is not a song
This is the meaning of your life
It's the way your days feel
In 4 /4 time
It's not just entertainment
Or candy for your ears
It's everything you live for
It's the reason you are here
It's the first love that you can't et
The child you used to be
The mother you don't call enough
The summers you were free
It's the nights of shameless passion
And you'll wonder at the stars
This is not a song
This is your heart
It's that lonely ache that wakes you
In the middle of the night
It's what drives you out the door each day
The strength that makes you fight
It's a tiny hand in yours
A couple kissing in the rain
It's what you hope is in that letter
It's that tear you can't explain
It's the breathless mystery you feel
An hour before a storm
It's the reason that you still salute your grandpa's uniform
It's what they all will talk about the day that you depart
This is not a song, this is your heart
You can't go on pretending
You don't care about these things
That you came in for an hour
Killing time to hear me sing
You came here to remember
Why you live and who you are
This is not a song, this is your heart
You came here to remember
Why you live and who you are
This is not a song, this is your heart
This is your heart
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
This is not a song, this is your heart
