Chin on those drums, on the guitar
Soft bass, the beat hums from afar
Feel the breeze beneath the stars
Dancing light from Venus and Mars
Whispers float on summer air
Sweet serenade (serenade)
Footsteps light as if they care
Gliding so smooth
City lights glow far away
City so bright
Love will find us if we stay
Promise tonight
Washington moonlight silver hue
Sparkling is underneath the palm tree
Blue ocean seep soft caress of midnight's hand
Gentle embrace we discover wonderland in this place
Echoes of a distant song
Heartstrings plucked, carried by the night so long
Melodies touch, caresses in the form of sound
A lullaby, memories that don't know bound
Starlit kisses on your cheek, tender moments
Souls bare when words would link
Whisper the truth, lost in rhythms slow and deep
Swirling passion washed in moonlight silver hue
Sparkling mist underneath the palm tree brew
Ocean sea soft caress of midnight's hand
Gentle embrace discover wonderland in this place
Scarlet kisses on your cheek
Tender moments
Souls bear when words will leak
Whisper the truth
Lost in rhythm slow and deep
Good winds, bossy dreams
Scarlet kisses on your cheek
Tender moments
Souls bear when words will leak
Whisper the truth
Lost in rhythm slow and deep
Good winds, bossy dreams
Bossy dream
We sleep close
