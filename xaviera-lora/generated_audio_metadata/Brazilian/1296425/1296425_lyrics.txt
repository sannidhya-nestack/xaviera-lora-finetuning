In the shade of a evil seed
The rhythm sets you free
Lost my way in moonlight waves
(Cold and dream)
City lights like fireflies blaze
(Whispered breeze)
Stars above in endless dance
Silence on, feel the night, take its chance
Cause, whispers float in the balmy air
Secret notes, footsteps echo if you dare
Gentle ghost, hold your breath let shadows play
Soft embrace, find your heart in this ballet
Timeless chase
Melody of life so sweet
Infinity
Every step is a heartbeat
Echo feet
Chasing moments, fleeting fast
Endless paths
Every memory must last
Captured fast
Infinity
(Galapagos chase)
Lost in time yet standing still
(Gentle through)
Every touch a tender through
(Kindred blue)
Eyes that sparkle in the night
(Finite light)
Holding on to what feels right
(Burning bright)
Wind and waves in perfect rhyme
(Ocean shine)
Turning nights into sublime
Ancient line, every breath a tale to spin
Gate with countless stories to begin
Where we've been
Girl
Where are we then?
Melody of life so sweet
Fill it deep
Every every step is a heartbeat
Echo feet chasing moments fleeting fast
Endless past every
