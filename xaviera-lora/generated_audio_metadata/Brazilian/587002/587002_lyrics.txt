I had jettisoned all of my pride
There was nothing left here deep inside
From the start of it I of course knew
That you brought me a fresh point of view
You were the cause of it
There's nothing more to it
All my mind said was you are alive
And I wanted you here by my side
Little did I know your fatal charms
Now you're right, you're tucked into my arms
Can't make much sense of it
There's nothing more to it
I'm longing to say that I love you
I want you to know that it's true
When I'm needing some consolation
Measuring the miracles won't do
That's the way that it goes from one look
To the first things I played by the book
There was no declaration from you
So I automatically knew
There was no recompense for it
Still can't make much sense of it
I'm longing to say that I love you
I want you to know that it's true
When I'm needing some consolation
Measuring the miracles won't do
Oh, it won't do
It just won't do
