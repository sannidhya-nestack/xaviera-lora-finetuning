In the soft moonlight breeze
Reach way to the waves of love
We all let the breeze carry our memories away
Through the night we'll sail (through starlit dreams)
On the ocean paling (where echoes gleam)
With a tender tale (of silent streams)
the dawn prevails (and morning beams)
In the city's heart (where shadows play)
We will find our own (in soft array)
From the very start (like a sweet ballet)
Let our spirits chart this golden day
In the city's harsh shadows play
We will find our soft array
From the very start like a sweet ballet
Let our spirits charm this golden day
Feel the whispers call in gentle tones
Hear the water fall across the stones
In this endless hall, my night can go
We will stand so tall, twilight's home
Underneath the sky, velvet embrace
As the moments fly, a mystic dream
We will never sigh, in this sacred state
Just a simple tie, woven with grace
In the silent steam of Rayo's night
Let our spirits lead in a soothing light
Promises we keep hold each other tight
As our hearts sweep into pure delight
Underneath this cauldron
