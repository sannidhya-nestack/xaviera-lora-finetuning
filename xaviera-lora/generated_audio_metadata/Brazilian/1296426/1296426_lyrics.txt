The waves they dance on silver sands
While guitars strum with gentle hands
A breeze of dreams blows through the trees
And whispers sing these melodies
Under moonlight where secrets shine softly, softly
We find a love that knows no time
Endlessly, endlessly
Stars above they start to align
Twinkling, twinkly
In shadows where the lovers roam
Quietly, quietly
Their whisper echoes finding home deeply, deeply
Each touch like whispers in the gloam, slowly, slowly
Feel the rhythm in the night, gently, gently
Every moment holding tight
Closely, closely
Dancing in the silver light
Hearts a-whispering in flight
In the garden of our embrace
We lose all sense of time and place
Timelessly, timelessly
Every kiss a tender trace
Sparking dreams we can
