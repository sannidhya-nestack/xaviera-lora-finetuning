In the sway of the night, let the rhythm take flight
Gentle whispers by the moonlight, a story unfolds with every step
Every line
Starlight shadows on the sand
Kiss goodnight
Every heart beats a command
The soft moon
Waves caress the silent shore
Whispered dream
In your eyes I see much more
Than it seems
Ocean's tune is in our ears
Love by the sea
Moments hold the weight of years
You and me
Why light paints the
The sky in hue, colors bright
Everything feels so brand new in the night
Vocal in your eyes, so tragic
Hold me close and feel the night, don't let
Whisper secrets in my ear, tell me slow
In this dance there's no more fear, let it flow
Gentle breeze plays with your hair (soft in the wind)
Can we stay forever there? (timeless breeze)
The sweet aroma in the air (blossoms bloom)
In your smile, a world so rare (dreams in bloom)
Local in your eyes, so magical
Me close and feel the night
Don't let whisper secrets in my ear
Tell me slow
In this dance there's no more fear
Let it flow
