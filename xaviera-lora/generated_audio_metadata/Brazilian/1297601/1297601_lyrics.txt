Underneath the ancient trees we stand
Holding hearts within an open hand
In the silence, whispers come free
Timeless love begins
Between just you and me
Moonlight dances softly on your face
Every touch and every warm embrace
Time can fade the way we feel tonight
Eternal glow in every daunting light
Through the ages we will always find
Love that lives beyond the sands of time
In your eyes I see the stars align
Timeless love forever
You are mine
Waves will crash and mountains can decay
But our love it always finds a way
In the garden where the roses bloom
