Whispers of the ocean breeze
Gentle sway of moonlit trees
Soft guitar plays in the night
Stars above are shining bright
Hold me close let's drift away
In this dream where we sway
Life's a dance
A sweet romance
In the rhythm of the waves
Candlelight and shadows play
On your lips the words we say
Every note a tender sigh
Floating in the endless sky
Hold me close, let's drift away
In this dream where we sway
Life's a dance, a sweet romance
In the rhythm of the waves
Candlelight and shadows play
On your lips the words we say
Every note a tender sigh
Floating in the endless sky
Hold me close, let's drift away
In this dream where we sway
Life's a dance, a sweet romance in the rhythm of the waves
Time melts in this embrace
Hearts align in this space
Just a moment, just a glance
Locked within this gentle trance
Find me here at end of day
In this dream where we sway
Life's a dance, a sweet romance
In the rhythm of the waves
