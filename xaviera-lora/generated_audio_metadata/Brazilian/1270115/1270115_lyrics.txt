Here's my bossa serenade
you look so exotic
Let's have a fresh ice lemonade
Let's keep it going
Guess I'll be lost in your eyes
For a few moments more
It's so simple feeling fine
Something otten, ooh
I think I'll dream of you
When I will be back home
Ooh, I'll be thinking of you when this dream will be gone
Here's my buzzer, serenade, stay a little bit more
It was so marvelous today
So, let's keep it going
Ooh, I think I'll dream of you
When I will be back home
Ooh, I'll be thinking of you when this dream will be gone, yeah
Ooh, I think I'll dream of you when I will be back home
Ooh, I'll be thinking of you when this dream will be gone
When this dream will be gone
