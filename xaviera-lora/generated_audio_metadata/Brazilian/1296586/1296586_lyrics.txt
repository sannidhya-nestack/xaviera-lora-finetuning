Sit back, relax, let the waves of sound in
Feel the breeze in your soul where the dreams begin
Swaying gently to the tune
The night is young and full of moon
Whispers float like balmy air
In each moment we will share
Stars are winking up above
Softly swaying with our love
Let's get lost in this warm night
Feel the rhythm hold me tight
Underneath the rhythm's charm
Every worry seems so far
We are floating free and light
Rhythms hold us through the night
Warm embrace and tender kiss
In this moment pure in bliss
Harmony in every note
In this song we are afloat
Sunset fading into dawn
As we dance until the morning
Harmony in every note
In this song we are afloat
Sunset fading into dawn
As we dance until the morning
Timeless echoes softly play (timeless)
In our hearts they'll always stay (fly away)
