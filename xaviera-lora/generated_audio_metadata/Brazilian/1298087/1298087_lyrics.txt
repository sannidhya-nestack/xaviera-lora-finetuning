In moonlight we do dance
Balls to tie the chains
Your hand in mine by the sea
Just you and me eternally
Timeless whisper in the breeze
Love's eternal, heart's at ease
In your eyes I see the years
No more worries, no more fears
Starlit skies, the gentle sway
Night turns softly into day
With every breath we share the air
A boundless love beyond compare
Timeless whisper in the breeze
Love's eternal, heart's at ease
In your eyes I see the years
No more worries, no more fears
Through every trial, we will stand like grains of gold within the sand
Our love, a story never told together
