Feel the sweat upon your skin
Let the waves roll you in
Hearts beat as one in time
On our knee in every rhyme
The sway with the palms (dancing dreams)
Stars in your eyes (nighttime gleams)
Whisper sweet nothings, breathe sweet lies
Love in the tropics, moonlit skies
Barefoot on beaches, sandy toes
Laughing with you, sunshine falls
Water so blue, reflections blend
Two souls in paradise (holid skies)
Barefoot on beaches (sandy tour)
Laughing with you (sunshine rose)
Water so blue (reflections blend)
Two souls in paradise (holid skies)
Hold me close with those times
Never let go, feel so much
Finding the starlight, softly calm
Eternal summer, love unfolds
Stroll down the coastline, hand in hand
Together forever, golden sand
Music in the air, sweet salmon
Moments like these (never please)
Hush now and listen (heart beats sleep)
Ocean symphony (ways that we)
In your embrace (everything's clear)
Nothing else matters (break your gear)
