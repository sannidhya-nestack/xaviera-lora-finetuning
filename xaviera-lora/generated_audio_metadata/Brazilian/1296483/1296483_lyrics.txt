The song takes you to a place where the sun kisses the ocean
And the breeze whispers secrets
We shall make the shore
Whispers of people
Palm trees sway in time
Dancing green
Moonlight paints the sand
Silver touch
Stars wing from above
Night time jewels
We find solace here
Heart beats slow
In a world so warm
Melting fears
With each breath we take
Life anew
Feel the rhythm flow
Soul embrace
Ocean's gentle hum
Timeless tunes
Shards tell ancient tales
History's voice
Footprints in the sand
Moments marked
Dreams float on the air
Endless hope
Ooh, ocean whispers in the breeze
Nature's song, laughter echoes wide
Joyful sound, colors blend and fade
Cues unite, peace is all we need
Simple truth, we find solace here
Heart beats slow
In a world so warm, melting fears
With each breath we take, life anew
Feel the rhythm flow, soul embrace
Soap whispers in the breeze
Nature's song, laughter echoes wide
Joyful sound, colours blend and fade
Hudes unite, peace is all we need
Simple truth
