Softly brings the dead to calm and glow in the heart of the city where whispers grow
A melody sweet as the summer rain
Dancing through the night with no refrain
Walking by the shore
Footprints in the sand
Listening to the waves
Ocean's gentle hands
Stars begin to shine
In a velvet sky
Moonlight touches dreams
Floating by and by
Underneath the palm, swaying with the beat
Laughter fills the air, on this golden street
Eyes that speak of love, silent secret words
Hearts entwined as one, fluttering like birds
Whispers of the single lover by him
The warm embrace of the evening sky
Moments felt so deep, deeper than the tide
In this dance of life, leave it all behind
Songs of yesterday, echo in the wind
Memories that play, where the words begin
Every step we take, etched into our minds
Together we create, rhythms that unwind
Time will never wait
But this night will stay
Captured in our hearts
Like a gentle sway
Endless melodies
Flow within our veins
In the harmony
Of our sweet refrains
Underneath the palms, swaying with the beat
Laughter fills the air on this golden street
Eyes that speak of love, silent secret words
Hearts entwined as one, fluttering like birds
Underneath the palms, swaying with the beat
Laughter fills the air on this golden street
Eyes that speak of love, silent secret words
Hearts entwined as one, fluttering like birds
Whispers of the sea, a lullaby
In the long breath of the evening sky
Moments felt so deeper than the tide
In this dance of mine
Leave it all behind
Whispers of the sea are lullaby
In the warm embrace of the evening sky
