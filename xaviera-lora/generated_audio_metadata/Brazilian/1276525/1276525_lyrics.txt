Strolling through the summer light
Where the ocean meets the sky
Gentle whispers in the breeze
Dancing shadows palm trees sway
Your eyes, a world unfolds
Secret stories softly told
With each step, the moments weave
A tapestry of love to believe
Golden sands beneath our feet
Rhythms play, hearts retreat
In this scene so serene
Time stands still, a sweet reprieve
In your eyes a world unfolds
Secret stories softly told
With each step the moments weave
A tapestry of love to believe
Let the waves embrace the shore
We'll discover evermore
In the moon's tender glow
Every heartbeat echoes slow
Whispers fade as twilight calls
Stars above like crystal halls
Hand in hand, forever bound
In this melody we found
Let the waves embrace the shore
We'll discover evermore
In the moon's tender glow
Every heartbeat echoes slow
Whispers fade
Asked why I called stars above
Like crystal halls hand in hand
Forever bound in this melody we found
