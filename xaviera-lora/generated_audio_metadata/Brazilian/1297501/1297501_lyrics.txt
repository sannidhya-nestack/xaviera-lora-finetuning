In a garden where the moonlight glows
Whispers of love in the breeze that blows
Timeless tales and stars above
Our hearts beat softly to the rhythms of love
Across the ocean where the waves embrace
In your eyes I find my place
Pure and gentle like the morning dew
Forever starts with me and you
In your arms I find my peace
An endless embrace, a soul release
Time stands still when you are near
With you my love there's nothing to fear
Beneath the canopy of ancient trees
Our love flows with such tender ease
Hand in hand through day and night
In this timeless dance our spirits take flight
Even mountains bow to love so true
Every moment feels refreshingly new
Boundless, ageless, eternally free together
