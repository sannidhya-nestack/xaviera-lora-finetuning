Sunset over water
Soft waves whisper jealously
Moonlight's getting closer
Feel the night's warm harmony
We dance beneath the stars (under all the stars)
Your laughter fills the air (embers of surprise)
Whispers in the breeze (send it to me goodbye)
Holding you so near (never let you go)
Eyes that mirror oceans (lips that balance me)
Fingers trace our story (eyes that intertwine)
Moments wrapped in shadows (time just fades away)
Hearts that beat together (syncopated souls)
Dreams will keep us floating (like we're lost at sea)
Love's the tide that carries you and me
Gaze into the distance (which is drawing near)
Every step together (walking hand in hand)
Underneath the moonlight shadows dance so slow
Every touch electric sparks that start to glow
Words we speak in silence language of our hearts
Bound by unseen forces
