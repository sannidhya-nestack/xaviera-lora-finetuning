When the moon gets low and the night slides slow
We dance in rhythms unplanned to whispers in the wind
Underneath the stars (soft and bright)
Feeling what is ours (holds us tight)
Hearts in sync and swaying (in the night)
With the music playing (pure delight)
Dreams are taking flight (soaring high)
In the moons soft light (you'll never say goodbye)
Echoes of the ocean (wave hello)
With pure devotion (hearts aglow)
Whispers in the dark (the ghost may)
Sparks a tiny spark
(Feel the fate)
Magic in the air (In the flow)
Taking us somewhere (Let it flow)
Gentle breezes twirl (Hold us close)
In a silent world (We compose)
Through the shadows dance (Love in tow)
Always taking a chance (don't let go)
Moments slowly pass (cherished time)
Like sand in glass (so divine)
We're forever drawn (hand in hand)
Until the night is gone (where we'll land)
