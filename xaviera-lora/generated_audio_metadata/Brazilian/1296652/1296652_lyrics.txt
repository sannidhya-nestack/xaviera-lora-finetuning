Walking down the beach (catching the breeze)
Stars above they teach (turn a leaf)
Footprints in the sand (turn gentle teeth)
Here's where dreams expand (hearts of peace)
Guitar in my hand (melodies kiss)
Echoes through the land (get bliss)
Moonlight understands (silvery this)
Love in open hands (father's wish)
Softly we sway, through the end of day
Feelings on display, in the moonlit bay
Waves are serenading, oceans hung
Life is never fading, sweet outcome
Moments we are trading, beating drum
Endless love parading, we become
Whispers fill the air, raise the song
Without any care, it belong
In the twilight glare, all night long
Love beyond compare, and strong
Whispers fill the air, raise a song
Without any care, we belong
In the twilight glare, all night long
Love beyond compare and strong
