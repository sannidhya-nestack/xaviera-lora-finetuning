In the quiet corners of Rio
Among the whispers of the waves
A song was born with hidden secrets in each note
Warm breeze carries tales of the past
Guitar strings hum softly in the night
Moonlight casts its glow like a kiss
Hearts entwined in rhythm, lost in time
Golden sand beneath feet so tender
Stars above us dance in the sky
Whispers in my ears sweet nothings
Promises of love never end
Every touch a story left unsaid
Every glance a poem written
Singing through the night just us two
In the murmur of ways we belong
Drifting on a dream softly swayed
Waves keep our secrets guarded close
Laughing in the dark underneath
Hidden by the night we exist
Sailing through memories as they flow
Timeless moments share frozen still
Captured in a glance, held forever
No words needed now, we both know
