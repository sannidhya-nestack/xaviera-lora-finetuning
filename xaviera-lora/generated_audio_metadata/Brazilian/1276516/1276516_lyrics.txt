In the gentle breeze of morning
Whispering dreams softly sway
The sun rays dance through the curtains
Waking the world in a tender way
Oh, sweet melodies play on
Let the rhythm carry me along
Through the streets and by the shore
I find my heart a little more
Underneath the palm trees swaying
Footprints trace our wandering path
The ocean's secrets call us dearly
Sharing stories of the past
The moon casts shadows soft and light
Painting silhouettes in the night
In this moment here with you
Time stands still like morning dew
Oh, sweet melodies play
Don't let the rhythm carry me along
Through the streets and by the shore
I find my heart a little warm
And as the evening fades away
Stars above will guide the way
In this dance of night and day
We'll find our dreams and gently sway
