The waves whisper secrets we've long otten
Underneath the moon's gentle caress
Let's dance with the whispers of love
Feel the ocean breeze in every breath
Sunset paints the sky, as time stands still
Shadows start to fly over distant hills
Whispers of the night, singing soft and sweet
Stars begin to lie, promises to keep
Sway beneath the moon, in a lover's chant
Hearts that need him too, lost in our romance
Ripples on a lake, echoes of a dream
Every move we make, cut the night routine
Hold me close tonight, make it feel forever
In this gentle light, dancing here together
Underneath the stars, we can find our way
Music from afar, chasing blues away
Breeze upon our skin, sailing through the time
Mysteries within
Rhythms so divine
Laughter from the waves
Carry on the wind
Every moment saves
Where our hearts begin
Whispering your name
Soft against my ear
Flicker of a flame
Love is always near
Gazing at the sky
Moonlight in our eyes
Sharing this goodbye
Never saying lies
Sway beneath the moon in a lover's trend
Hearts that beat in tune, lost in our romance
Lipples on a lake, echoes of a dream
Every move we make, let the night redeem
Hold me close tonight
