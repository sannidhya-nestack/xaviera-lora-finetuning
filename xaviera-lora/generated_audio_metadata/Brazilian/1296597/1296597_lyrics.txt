Under the golden sun, gently waves unfold
Time moves slow as secret stories are told
Soft breeze through the cave (summer's touch)
Whispers in the lane (a lover's hush)
Eyes meet in the rain (a silent plea)
Hearts beat the refrain (forever we)
Moonlight paints the street (the silver glow)
Dancing in the heat (the twilight's flow)
Swaying to the beat (embrace the night)
Swept off our feet (with pure delight)
Underneath the stars (a cosmic kiss)
No one else but us (an endless bliss)
Laughing without pause (a moment's crush)
Nowhere else because (we feel the rush)
A city's melody (a whispered song)
Carrying you and me where dreams belong
Each note a memory of times unseen
Floating endlessly in the routine
Footsteps on the shore, a rhythmic sway
Calling us for more as night meets day
Feel the oceans roar (our hearts entwine)
To the core we pour (soft valentine)
