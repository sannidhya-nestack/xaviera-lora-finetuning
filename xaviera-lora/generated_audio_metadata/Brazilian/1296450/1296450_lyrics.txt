Under the city lights I found a rhythm
Whispers of jazz and ocean waves entwine
Together we dance in this night's prison
Melodies and hearts perfectly aligned
We sway beneath the moon, golden moments
Your eyes are sparkling tunes, silent secrets
In this dance we find our room, gloomless echoes
Our hearts in motion, prune endless dreams
With every step we take, warming whispers
Our love's a song we make, gentle breezes
In harmony we blend, soft embraces
A melody without an end, eternal trace
Your laughter like the waves we serenade
A memory that saves hidden treasure
As stars above us shine glowing embers
Our souls forever twine, bound together
With every note we share, dance in shadow
A story without compare
Midnight reverie
In the somber we unite
Ephemeral thrills
Tied by love's guiding light
Magical spills
With every step we take
Warming whispers
Our love's a song we make
Gentle breezes
In harmony we blend
Soft embraces
A melody without an end
A laughter like the way sweet Sarah made
A memory that saves hidden treasure
As stars above us shine glowing embers
Our souls forever twine bound together
