Under the warm golden sun
As the waves kiss the shore
We sway to the rhythm
Whispers echoing more
Dancing shadows at dawn (sweet so near)
Moonlight drapes the lawn (sun that can't stay)
Dreams we keep holding on (while lights go red)
Footsteps we never caught (the one that's displayed)
Soft tunes play in the night (early light spray)
Stars shimmer so bright (so early in space)
Lingering moments inside (sad and sad and sad and sad and sad and sad and sad)
Hearts soaring in flight (in light and light and light and light)
In the calm ocean sun (we drift and we soar)
We'll stay here lifelong (just once more)
This place we belong (through the door)
All of growing strong
For that rock of ours
