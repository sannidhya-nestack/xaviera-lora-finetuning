Land of soft light, of flesh-light,
Mothers leave their son to the realms,
Ranger eyes are stars that gleam
Endless if every step we make
Timeless the gentle waves kiss the shore
Distant poems, this samba of our souls
Rhythmic our hearts beat in harmony
Tangoing stars as melody unfolds
Fate's guitar in the rhythm of the night
So steep, we lose ourselves in time
Endless world, with every beat we fly
Moonlit skies dance so divine
Love's desire, loves like these are rare
Midnight, we hold them close and tight
Cure is flat underneath the starry feathers
Rides enchanting night
Feathers flutter in the rhythm of the night
Souls dim, we lose ourselves in time
Endless, with every beat we fly
Ooh this, girl this dance so divine
Love's design begins to wake
Golden
We whisper soft goodbyes
Sunrise time in our hearts will keep
Midnight's this memory that won't die
Tunnel sky
