In the quiet of the evening light
The gentle whispers take their flight
A soft samba sways through the air
With every breath, the world lies bare
Oh, the ocean's lullaby softly calls
Its rhythm echoes in the hardened walls
Dreamy nights under stars that sway
In the warm embrace of the moonlight bay
Tender murmurs of a sweet guitar
Guide the footsteps of love from afar
Hearts entwined in a blissful trance
Lost in the magic of a midnight dance
Oh, the ocean's lullaby softly calls
Its rhythm echoes in the hardened walls
Dreamy nights under stars that sway
In the warm embrace of a moonlit day
Colors blend in the twilight's haze
Silhouettes move and embrace a gentle gaze
Whispers mix with the ocean song
Floating through the night where dreams belong
