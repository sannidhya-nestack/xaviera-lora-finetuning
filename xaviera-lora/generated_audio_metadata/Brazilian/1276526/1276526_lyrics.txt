In the gentle evening glow
Where the sea breeze whispers low
We'll find a place where time moves slow
Between the sand and the sunset show
Sway with me beneath the stars
In the rhythm of guitars
With the moon as our guiding light
Let's dance away into the night
Feel the ocean's tender sighs
As we lose ourselves in skies
Painted with the songs of dreams
Floating softly like moonbeams
Sway with me beneath the stars
In the rhythm of guitars
With the moon as our guiding light
Let's dance away into the night
Every moment seems to fly
With a sparkle in your eye
A world where nothing's left to miss
Wrapped in the warmth of a secret kiss
