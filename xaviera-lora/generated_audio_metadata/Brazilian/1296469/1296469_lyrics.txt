Under the twilight skies and breeze
Where shadows dance and love takes place
Feel the rhythm soft and warm
This is where all our hearts transform
Whispers of the ocean song, where the night
Steps in sync we glide along, fire line
Embrace the dream where we belong, paradise
Eyes that speak without a word, silent lies
Gentle winds caress your face, soft and slow
Fingers intertwined in grace, hearts aglow
Moments drift like times parade, flowing dreams
In the dance of hues and shades, silver streets
Gentle winds caress your face, thick and slow, howl and soar
In your arms I'm lost, serene, moonlit flow
Echoes of a distant tune, softly play
Wander through the night till noon, never fade
Hold me close till dawn arrives, whisper low
Where the magic never died, chanting gold
Every step a story through, tales unfold
In this dance just me and you, hearts of gold
Fireflies light up the dark, glowing trails
In your smile I find my spark, no veils
Let the world around us sleep, silence fear
As we slice a giganski, draw a knee
