Ever feel like traveling some place far away
Ever get that inner urge to roam
Your imagination is around your fair
Just as long as I'm with you
And as long as you're with me
Just as long as we're together, we're at home
We can close our eyes and take a holiday
Sunny skies on surface and below
Whispering "I love you" in the cold, warm air
Even if it's you and I underneath the cloudy sky
Just as long as we're together we're at home
And in November when it's cold and grey
We'll have all the Sundays reminiscent of May
When the embers start to fade away
We'll look forward to a brand new day
Can't you see I love you in a special way
You and I were meant to write a book
But your arms around me and we're happy there
Just as long as I'm with you
And as long as you're with me
Just as long as we're together we're at home
And in November when it's cold and grey
We'll have all the Sundays reminiscent of May
And when the embers start to fade away
We'll look forward to a brand new day
Can't you see I love you in a special way
You and I were meant to write a book
Put your arms around me and we're halfway there
Just as long as I'm with you, just as long as you're with me
Just as long as we're together we're at home
Just as long as I'm with you, just long as you're with me
Just as long as we're together we're at home
