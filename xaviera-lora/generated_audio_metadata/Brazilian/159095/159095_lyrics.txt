Seeking some answers
Looking around, car chasing them, foot racing them down
Through yesterday's alleys, canyons and valleys
The same old abandoned towns
Running in circles, falling behind
Trapped and imprisoned in time
Awareness lies hidden, far off and forbidden
Somewhere beyond your mind
Take off the mask, remove the dark glasses
Tune into the feeling'til the feeling passes
Reach through the window, grab a handful of sky
Don't be afraid to die
Look into yourself, feel your heartbeat dancing
Break through the walls and continue advancing
Open the window, jump off the edge and fly
Do do do do do do do do do
Taking some chances, learning to be
The original, unabridged me
Eyes that were burning, downcast, downturned
Learning again to see
Finding some feelings, learning to cry
Watching some dead heroes die
But the dead are iven and life is for the living
So you stretch out your wings and fly
Take off the mask, remove the dark glasses
Tune into the feeling'til the feeling passes
Reach through the window, grab a handful of sky
Don't be afraid to die
Look into yourself, feel your heartbeat dancing
Break through the walls and continue advancing
Open the window, jump off the edge and fly
Open the window, jump off the edge, and fly
