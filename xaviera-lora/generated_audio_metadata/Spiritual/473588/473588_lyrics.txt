Oh, it's time to put on your shopping shoes (ha-ha-ha)
What's going down, man? I'm a free man now, hey-hey!
Thanks to Jesus
You see, if you've never been in chains
If you've never been bound before and set free
Then you don't know how it feels for someone to come to your rescue
That's why I'm singing
I'm free at last
Thank God that I'm free, I'm free at last
God has set me free, I can play and sing, free at last
Thank God that I'm free, I'm free at last
Come on with me while I play and I sing along
And down, down down down down
I'm just singin' sing your song if you feel it
Because Jesus has set me free
And it's so wonderful (it's so wonderful) for me to know
That I don't have to walk around
With my head hung down
Because I'm not bound
I just want you to know
Jesus set me free
Uh-huh, and I'm glad
I'm glad about it
Yes I am
Listen here
One day
I was lost, I was blind but could not see (God help me)
But Jesus reached down and took my hand and He rescued me
Let me sing, let me sing this song (Thank God that I'm free)
I'm free at last (I'm free at last)
You may not understand how I feel about it
So I'm gonna play my guitar and lie down
Thank God I'm free
I'm free at last
Yes I am
I'm not bound and changed any longer
Thanks to Jesus, you see
Jesus said we have not a high place
That cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities
But I want you to know He was tempted at all points
Just like you and I
