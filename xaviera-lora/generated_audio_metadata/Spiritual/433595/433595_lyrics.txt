Never needed anyone or anything
If you knocked me down, I'd get back up again
Never used to talk to you, never read your book before
Now I'm standing here knocking at your door
Oh, I need you now
I'm lost in the dark
I can't find my way out
Of this empty space
I need you now
I've swallowed my pride
I'm ready for this ride
To a better place, I need you now
People hang on to your every word
You give them hope
And you take away the hurt
You bring comfort to a world in pain
Now I'm the one standing here crying in the rain
Oh I need you now
I'm lost in the dark
I can't find my way out
All this empty space, I need you now
I've swallowed my pride
I'm ready for this ride
To a better place, I need you now
Never needed anyone or anything
Now I'm the one standing here crying in the rain (crying in the rain)
Oh, I need you now (now)
I'm lost in the dark
I can't find my way out (can't find my way out)
Out of this empty space, I need you now
I've swallowed my pride
I'm ready for this ride
To a better place, I need you now
