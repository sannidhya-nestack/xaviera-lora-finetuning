I was the friend that denied you
Three times I denied you
When the third rooster crowed
And I, I handed you over
Thirty pieces of silver
Was the price of my soul
And there on the road to Damascus
I saw clearly what I was
When your blinding light came
And love called my name
When I was lost
I had no hope
you spoke to me
You took away the shadows
That clouded my heart
I knew I was found
On that day when love called my name
I was the man who was washing his hands to hand over a king
And I said I wouldn't believe it
Unless I could see it
The scarred hands and feet
And I was the thief hung beside you
Deserving to die
But you shouldered the blame
And love called my name
When I was lost
I had no hope'til you spoke to me
You took away the shadows that clouded my heart
I knew I was found on that day when love called my name
I was the friend they had laid in the grave
I heard through their sorrowful cries
The voice that commanded the wind and the waves
Say, "Arise, arise" and love called my name
Ooh, when love called my name
When I was lost, I had no hope
you spoke to me
You took away the shadows, the cloud in my heart
I knew I was found
On that day when love called my name
Would love call my name?
Would love call my name?
