Over a hundred years ago in a small church in Maryland, Elvina Hall poured out her heart on a piece of paper and wrote the lyrics to a hymn that she had no melody for.
Completely unaware of her, the choir director of the same church composed a tune he so appropriately named "All to Christ I Owe."
It was only by sheer chance at the suggestion of the head pastor that the two met, merged their talents, and went on to create a hymn that would continue to inspire people for over a decade.
I hear the Savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Lord, now indeed I find Thy power, and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spot, and melt the heart of stone
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
He washed my sin and shame white as snow
And when before the throne I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
The sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
The sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
He washed me white as snow
He washed me white as snow
