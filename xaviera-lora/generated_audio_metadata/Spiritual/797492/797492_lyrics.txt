Don't be weary, Trevor, come along home to Jesus
My head got wet with the midnight dew
Come along home to Jesus
Angels bear me witness to
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveler
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveler
Come along home to Jesus
Where to go I did not know
Come along home to Jesus
Ever since he freed my soul
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveller
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveller
Come along home to Jesus
I look at the world and the world looks new
Come along home to Jesus
I look at the world and the world looks new
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveller
Come along home to Jesus
Don't be weary, traveller
Come along home to Jesus
Come along home to Jesus
Come along home to Jesus
