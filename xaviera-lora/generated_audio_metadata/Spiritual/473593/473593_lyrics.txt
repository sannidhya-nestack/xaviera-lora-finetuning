We want everybody to lift up their holy hands to God
And thank Him for everything He has done for you throughout your life
You see, we come to praise God because
There's no one else to give the praise to
For delivering mankind from sin
Oh, but Jesus
That's why we're gonna sing this song
Lord, we worship you
Lord, we worship you
Listen here
We want to praise you
We want to praise you
For helping us
To overcome
The things of the world
And
We want to tell the world about you
For what you've done for us (you)
Some two thousand years ago
When you went to the cross (yeah, yeah, yeah)
At Calvary
That's why (we're praising you)
We're gonna praise you (the King of Kings)
Early in the morning
Yes, we will
We'll praise you, we're gonna praise you
The Lord of love, in a new day
Yes we will, I wanna sing this song
We'll praise you, we're gonna praise you
The King of kings, in the midnight
In the midnight hour
Lord have mercy
We'll praise you, we're gonna praise you
Not tomorrow
For right now
Whoa
Lord we thank you
Lord I praise you
Lord I magnify you
For all the things you have done for us
Throughout our lives
You see God I didn't know anything about this salvation
Until you sent down your son Jesus
Oh God, and oh God the love I have received over the years
Has kept me, has encouraged me, has strengthened me
And I don't know of anyone else to give the praise to
That's why
We want to thank you (thank you Jesus)
Lord, we want to thank you (for all that you've done)
For the days you were merciful
And your grace was upon our lives
We wanna dedicate our lives to your service
And bring a message to a dying world
