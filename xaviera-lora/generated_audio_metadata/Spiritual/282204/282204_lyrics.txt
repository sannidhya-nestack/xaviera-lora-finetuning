Well, you may not be looking at the perfect me
You may not be seeing what he sees
You can't judge a book by its delivery
You can never change its history (but that's the name)
You may think this life merely competitive
I would have to say I disagree
Well if you knew the truth your life was meant to live
As an equal through eternity
I wanna be the best that I can be
Now that I've finally been set free
I would encourage you to be
The best that you can be
I wanna live the best life that I can
Giving up everything I am
You and I were meant to understand
We're in God's command
You and I, we have no competition, no
We are in a battle with our past
Natural or spiritual decision
Make or break the future that will last
I want to be the best that I can be
Now that I've finally been set free
I would encourage you to be
The best that you can be
I want to live the best life that I can
Giving up everything I am
You and I were meant to understand
We're in God's command
It will happen when you give your love away
Don't hold back, just give it all you've got
Don't give in or give up on your dreams today
Let them build the future, dream a lot
Break the system, think in terms of freedom
Leave your wants and needs at heaven's door
Don't concern yourself about the kingdom
You and I were meant to live forevermore
It will happen when you give your love away
Don't hold back, just give it all you got every day
Don't give in or give up on your dreams today
Let them build a future dream a lot
