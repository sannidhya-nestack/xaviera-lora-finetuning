Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Be the light within your soul
Illuminate each one you know
Let your inner radiance shine bright
A star to pierce the darkest night
Be the light of God alive
Be the love within your heart
Embrace the lost and torn apart
Teach with tenderness and open mind
For where the flame of love you'll find
The heart of God in all mankind
Light and love are with you now
In all you do and say
We plenish by your conscious vow
To hold God in your thoughts each day
Love and light will lift you up
You hold the master key
To open hearts and open minds
Unlocking your divinity
Be the light within your soul, lead each one you know
And let your inner radiance shine, use the darkest sun
Be the light of God, the light (Be the light, be the light)
Be the love within your heart (Be the light)
Embrace the lost and turn of heart
Teach with tenderness and open mind
For with the flame of love you'll find
The heart of God in all mankind
Be the love, be the love, be the love, be the love
