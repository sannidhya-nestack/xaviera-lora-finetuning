Lord I know you're onto me
I can't hide nothing from you
All of my brilliant schemes
You see right through
Each time I think that I can't wing it by myself
You make it clear to me I'm lost without your help
I wanna see you
In the sweet hereafter
I wanna swing from the highest rafter
Make me your servant, you are the master
Take me with you to the sweet hereafter
Your love's the only thing that matters
Take me with you to the sweet hereafter
Heaven is the only place I ever want to go now
I know it's not too late to save my soul
Cause when you said your son to be a mortal man
You gave us all a chance to live again
I want to see you
In the sweet hereafter
I wanna swing
From the highest rafter
Make me your servant
You are the master
Take me with you
To the sweet hereafter
Your love's the only
Thing that matters
Take me with you
To the sweet new rapture
Each time I turn my back on you I feel so small
It seems I'm always on a hilltop when I fall
I wanna see you
In the sweet hereafter
I wanna swing
From the highest rafter
Make me your servant
You are the master
Take me with you
To the sweet hereafter
Your love's the only
Thing that matters
Take me with you
To the sweet hereafter
When it's my time
To the sweet hereafter
