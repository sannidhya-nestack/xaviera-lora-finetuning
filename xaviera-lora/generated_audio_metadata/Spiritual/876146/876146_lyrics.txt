If I speak with the tongues of men and angels
But do not have love
I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal
If I have a gift of prophecy
And know mysteries and all knowledge
And if I have all faith
So as to remove mountains
But do not have love
Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous
Love does not brag and is not arrogant
Love does not act unbecomingly
It does not seek its own
Is not provoked
Does not take into account a wrong suffered
Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness
But rejoices in the true
Love bears all things
Believes in all things
Hopes all things
Endures all things
Love never fails
Love never fails
Love bears all things
Believes in all things
Hopes, all things, endures, all things
Love never fails, love never fails
Love never fails, love never fails
