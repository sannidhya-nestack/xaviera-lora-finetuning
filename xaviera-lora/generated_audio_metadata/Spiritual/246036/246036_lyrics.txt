I am watching with the eyes of grief
Listening with much concern
Questioning the absence of relief
Still I want you to know
Through every time there is peace
Falling from each whispered breath
There is hope stirring all around this heavy load
You won't be left alone to bear
Love is surrounding you through all of our hearts
Holding you right here where you are
Holding you right here where you are
When it rains it pours they always say
And there's a river at your door
I wish I could make it go away
I don't know how anyone could take anymore
But there is peace falling from each whispered prayer
There is hope stirring all around this heavy load
You won't be left alone to bear
Love is surrounding you
Through all of our hearts
Holding you right here where you are
Holding you right here where you are
Swimming in these tears it's hard to understand
That faith can be a refuge for your soul
So hold on to God's promises
We're here to let you know that there is peace
There is peace falling from each whispered prayer
There is hope stirring all around
This heavy load you won't be left alone to bear
Love is surrounding you through all of our heart
There it is
There is hope stirring all around
This heavy load you won't be left alone to bear
Love is surrounding you (Love is surrounding you)
Holding you right here where you are (Love is surrounding you)
Right
Right here where you are, love is surrounding you
Where you are, where you are
(howling)
