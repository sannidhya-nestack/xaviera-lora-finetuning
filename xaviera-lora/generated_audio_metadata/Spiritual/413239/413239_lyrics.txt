(audience applauding)
I saw the Lord upon a throne, exalted high
His glory shone, the seraphim extolled His ways
His robe made full, the house of praise
All the earth is full of His glory, holy, holy
Holy, holy is the Lord
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
I saw the Lord upon the throne
Exalted high, His glory shone
The seraphim extolled His ways
His robe made full, the house of praise
All the earth is full of His glory
Holy, holy
Holy is the Lord
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
All the earth is full of His glory
All the earth is full of His glory
All the earth is full of His glory
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord, holy, holy, holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord
