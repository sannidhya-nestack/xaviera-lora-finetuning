Oh my love, you are to me
More precious than the morning sun
Now and eternally
Oh my love, hold me near
And whisper to me the words you know I long to hear
I love you more than you'll ever know
I love you
So hold on tight and don't let go
A love that's strong will never end
Because you know
You're my best friend
Oh my love
You've got a tune that's all your own
And no one else can compare
It's you and you alone
Oh my love
Each night I kneel in prayer
And ask the Lord to guide our love
With each of us be there
I love you
More than you'll ever know
I love you
So hold on tight and don't let go
A love that's strong will never end
Because you know
You're my best friend
Who your love
Wipes away the sorrow
Lifting me
So I can face tomorrow
Tomorrow, my love
I'm never insecure with your honesty
And trust in me, my love will endure,'cause I love you
More than you'll ever know
I love you
So hold on tight and don't let go
A love this strong will never end
Because you know
You're my best friend, yeah
Because you know you're my best friend
