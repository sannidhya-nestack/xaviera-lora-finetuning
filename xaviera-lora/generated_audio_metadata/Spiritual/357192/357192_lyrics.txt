But do you feel the same
When all you see is blame for me
And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with you
And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with you
I wanna go deeper
Is this just a stupid whim
I wanna be weaker
And be a help to the strong
And I wanna run faster
But this old leg won't carry me
I wanna be
I wanna be
So maybe I can run
Or maybe I can fly to you
Do you feel the same
All you see is blame and me yeah
And the wonder of it all
That I'm living just to fall
More in love with you
And the wonder of it all
That I'm living just to fall
More in love with you
More in love
And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with you
The wonder of it all
I'm living just to fall, yeah
And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with you every day
And the wonder of it all is that I'm living just to fall more in love with you
