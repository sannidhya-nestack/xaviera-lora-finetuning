If I only had a candle all the times you lied
I'd put a scar in all the dim darkness you left behind
And I would set my eyes before me and I'd never stop in all my days
And I would toss a chance at just one glance in all your twisted ways
Well, I've lived in many mansions, yes, and I've worshipped many things
And I've found myself in bondage when I made myself a king
And I've stumbled over castles when I have built them on my own
And I've stepped on every person on the way to every throne, yeah
You can't shame me, oh
And you can't shame me
Yet I still will run
Far beyond the day
Past the sea of tears
Till I reach the end
Of the war and pain
And rest inside your arms
Such a vicious common thread through the stories you have told
That increasing pools of fiction and the morals that you stole
I've seen much too much iveness in the eyes of a slave
To resurrect the dialect of a man who lost his way, yeah
You can't shame me
And you can't shame me
Yet I still will run far beyond the day
Past the sea of tears
Till I reach the end of the war and pain
And rest inside your arms
He is all I have, he is all I take now
He is all I have
Follow your hand, I am alive, I don't want to go
Follow your hand, I am alive, I don't want to go
Follow your hand, I am alive, I don’t want to go
Follow your hand, I am alive
And I still will run far beyond the day and past the sea of tears
Till I reach the end of the war and pain and rest inside your arms
But nothing's wrong, I'm glad that he is all I claim now
But nothing's wrong, I'm glad that he is all I claim now
The love is all I love, the love is all I need now, the love is all I need now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
