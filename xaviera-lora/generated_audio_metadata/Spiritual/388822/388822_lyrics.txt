Closer than we can fathom
But far beyond what we imagined
Hopeless can find you
Wisdom's confounded
But we're astounded by the mystery
Your ways are higher than ours
Higher is your name above all names as heavens
Higher than earth, higher are your thoughts and ways
Constant yet unexpected
Yelling to death but resurrected
Life giving water consuming fire
None can deny you're such a mystery
Your ways are higher than ours
Higher is your name above all names
As heavens higher than earth
Higher are your thoughts and ways
Holy are your ways
Holy are your ways
Glorious, mysterious
Holy are your ways
Holy are your ways
Holy are your ways
Glorious, mysterious
Holy are your ways
As heavens higher than earth higher are your thoughts and ways
Your ways are higher than ours
Higher is your name above all names
As heavens higher than earth
Higher are your thoughts and ways
Your ways are higher than us
Higher is your name above all names
As heavens are higher than earth
Higher are your thoughts and ways
