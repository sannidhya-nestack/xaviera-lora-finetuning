Anyways, that's enough of that. We do love you guys. Thank you for supporting what we do and thank you for worshiping with us and not just letting us worship for you.
We do want to sing a song and we hope that you guys are, you freak out and sing praises to God. Are you ready for that?
Here we go.
Sing of your mercy, joy of heavenly love, sing of your faithfulness
Grant Your grace to us, we'll sing as loud as we can
(Loud as they can)
We'll sing of Your beauty, of His unfailing deeds
We'll sing of Your righteousness and the strength to see
We'll sing as loud as we can
Alleluia!
Amen, your glory fills this place
Your glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your evil's praise
Our voices gladly sing along
Join in heaven's song
That you are the living King of Kings
Sing of your favor, of this abundant life
Sing of your patience, Lord, with voices lifted high
We sing as loud as we can
Louder than the world
Your glory fills this place
And your glory fills this place, we think
With the sound of all your eagerness, praise
Our guilty gladly sing along
It's your land and the song that you are the living king of, we
Sing of our hunger
And our motherly
Who sing of our broken chains
And how you set us free
Who sing of your whisper of love
How it's louder than the world
Sing of your whisper of love
How it's louder than the world
Sing of your whisper of love
How it's louder than the world
And the glory fills this place today
With the sound of all your people praise
Our voices gladden this day of love
To know you have a song that's worth while of it
Alleluia
And the glory fills this place today
The sound of all your people's praise
Our voices wildly sing along
It's your one and only song that you are the living king of day
We sing of your mercy, and your unending love
We sing of your faithfulness, and your grace to us
Sing as loud as we can, I am one
Sing as loud as we can, I am one
