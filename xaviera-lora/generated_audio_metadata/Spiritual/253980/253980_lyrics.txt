My Jesus, I love Thee
I know Thou art mine
For Thee all the folly of sin
I resign
My gracious Redeemer
My Saviour art Thou
If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus'tis now
I love thee because thou hast first loved me
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree
The thorns on thy brow
If ever I love thee
My Jesus'tis now
In mansions of glory and endless delight
I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'll let you in, I'
In heaven so bright I'll sing with a glittering crown on my brow
If ever I should die, I'll sing with a glittering crown on my brow
I love Thee, my Jesus,'tis now,'tis now
