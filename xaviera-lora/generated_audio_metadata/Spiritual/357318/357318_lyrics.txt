Oh Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I see
And when your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me
Oh Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I see
And when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me
I want to take your word and shine it all around
First help me just to live it Lord
And when I do it will help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is giving glory to you
Oh Lord, please light the fire
That once burned bright and clear
Replace the lamp of my first love
That burns with holy fear
I want to take your word and shine it all around
First help me just to live it Lord
And when I do
Help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is giving glory to you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you,
