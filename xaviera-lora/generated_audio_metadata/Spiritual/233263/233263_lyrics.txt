Jesus said, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
Reach out and touch the master
He'll gladly listen in
He loves you brother, sister
Invite him to come in
It's so simple that it's hard to buy
Do it now, we'll never say goodbye (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
If you want peace with Jesus
Accept His perfect will
Give up our life of sadness
And live with joy fulfilled
It's forever, it's eternity
Come to Calvary, Jesus sets you free
Come sing the song of victory
And start your life again
Come live a life of mercy
And leave a life of sin
Give it all and give it for all time
Let the spirit give you peace of mind
Come join with all the angels
Come beat his royalty
Come light your waiting candle
Come live eternally
How, how, how, how, how
How, how
I am, I am, I am, I am, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ,I',I'm
Come with me, come to Him
Come worship the Son of God
