I read the morning paper
Then have to look the other way
How can one ravage a child
And simply walk away?
In the face of injustice
When hope comes undone
I hold on to these words
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
On the judgment day
My Lord will have His way
So keep your faith in the truth
We'll give the devil his due
My Lord will overcome
Thy will be done
Hellfire and damnation
Isn't my kind of gift
And victory don't come, no, no, at the hand of a gun
But I won't feel helpless, no, no, though I can feel the rage
The stronger man stands silent
Trusting these words I say
Thine will be done
Thy will be done
On the judgment day
My Lord will have His way
So keep your faith in the truth
Ooh, give the devil his due
My Lord will overcome
Thy will be done
My Lord will overcome
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
On the judgment day
Thy will be done
My Lord will have His way
Thy will be done
So keep your faith in the truth
Thy will be done
We'll give the devil his due
Thy will be done
Thy will be done
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
