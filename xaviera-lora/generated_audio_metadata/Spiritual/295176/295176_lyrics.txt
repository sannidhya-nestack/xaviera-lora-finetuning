It's amazing, it's amazing
What the Lord has done for me
It's amazing, it's amazing what he did to set me free
He took all my shame and made it his own
He bore all my pain and did it alone
He became the ransom I couldn't be
It's amazing what he did for me
It's amazing, it's amazing
What the Lord has done for me
It's amazing, it's amazing
What He did to set me free
He bought me the right to call him my friend
He laid down his life, now mine never ends
He stepped from his throne so willingly, it's amazing
What He did for me
He stepped from His throne
So willingly
It's amazing
What He did for me
