Take my lack of courage away
Take all of my failures away
And take the times when my anger caused her in pain
Take the fights with my father away
Take my broken heart and make it brand new
I need to believe there's only you
Lord, we give it all to you
Our problems and cares
Lord, we give it all to you
The burdens we bear
We give it all to you
Take my addictions away
Take my broken friendships away
Please take my bad decisions, my lack of faith
Away
And take my hate away
Take my shattered dreams and make them brand new
I need to believe there's only you
Lord, we give it all to you
Our problems and cares
Lord, we give it all to you
The burdens we bear
We give it all
We give it all
Can I let go of all the lies?
And see myself through your eyes?
Can the past still be erased
Can the peace still be replaced
Lord, we give it all to you
Sweet lord
We give it all to you
Lord, we give it all to you (we give it all to you)
Lord, we give it all to you (we give it all to you)
We give it all
We give it all (we give it all to you) we give it all (we give it all to you
We give it all
We give it all
We give it all to you
