I am the question and you are the answer
I am the lyric with words who like dancers
Need you the melody to give life to my song
I am a boat in the sea all alone
You are the North Star guiding me home
I'm the explorer and you are the treasure I seek
And how can I dare to believe
I wake from this dream to see
Impossibly beautiful
You walk beside me
And all that I see in you
I just want to be with you
Impossibly beautiful
But beautifully true
I am a Japanese house made of paper
You, like a hurricane, lay me to waste
Here in my brokenness everything changes but you
And how can I dare to believe
I wake from this dream to see
Impossibly beautiful
You walk beside me
And all that I see in you
I just want to be with you
Impossibly beautiful
But beautifully true
