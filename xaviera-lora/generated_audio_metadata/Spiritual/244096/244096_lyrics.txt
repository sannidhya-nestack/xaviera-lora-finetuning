You were young when you first knew
You would be alone
Holidays and family ways
Would never be your own
A guest at every wedding
An extra place at meals
But nothing ever seems to feel
Quite the way home feels
Wherever you go
I will go wherever you live, I will live
I will come to love your people, your God will be my God
Where you die there I will die and be buried by your side
May God grant our love to grow and never end
Now we stand on sacred ground
Our family's near
Law allows these holy vows
Your home is here
I don't have land or riches
I bring my heart alone
But this one gift I offer you
A family of your own
Wherever you go, I will go
Wherever you live, I will live
I will come to love your people
Your God will be my God
Where you die there I will die and be buried by your side
May God grant our love to grow and never end
Wherever you go, I will go
Wherever you live, I will live
I will come to love your people
Your God will be my God
Where you die, there I will die
And be buried by your side
May God grant our love to grow and never end
And may you find your home in me, my beloved and my friend
