You are more beautiful
Than the stars in the sky
I look up to you
You hold our universe
In the palm of your hand
Yet you know where I am
You reach out to me
I lift you high, no one's above you
I lift you high, no one is like you
You are the almighty God
You reign
Let the mountains rejoice, you're alive
The wind carries your voice, you are here
And the world longs to see you
The nations bow down to your name
You reign
You reign
You are more beautiful
Than the stars in the sky
I look up to you
You hold our universe
In the palm of your hand
Yet you know where I am
You reach out to me
I lift you high, no one's above you
I lift you high, no one is like you
You are the almighty God
You reign, let the mountains rejoice your life
The wind carries your voice, you are here
And the world longs to see you
The nations bow down to your name
You reign, you reign
You reign, you reign
You, you reign
You reign (more beautiful, wonderful)
You are the king who reigns
More beautiful, wonderful
You are the king who reigns
More beautiful, wonderful, you are the king who reigns
More beautiful, wonderful, you are the king who reigns
You reign, you reign
