How do I ive myself when these memories haunt me?
The pain I feel won't let me be
I wish I had more confidence
Knew better what to do
Instead of giving myself away to you
They say you cannot love till you love yourself
They say you don't need to put your heart on the shelf
Even though I've been iven
Can I ive myself
They say
When I see myself in the mirror
I hear a voice say
You can't fool me, I know who you are
And you can't run away
But if his blood has covered me
From the sins of my past
Can I find the strength to fight
And live the life that he has cast?
They say you cannot love till you love yourself
They say you don't need to put your heart on the shelf
Even though I've been iven
Can I ive myself
And have the faith to believe I'm okay
Do I look up and wait for absolution
Do I look up
I have to remember that the past is in the past
I've been iven by a love I know will last
As they say, you cannot love'til you love yourself
They say, he will always save us from ourselves
I know I've been iven, now I ive myself
And have the faith to believe I'm okay
They say, you cannot love'til you love yourself
They say, he will always save us from ourselves
I know I've been iven, he gave a new life to me
With Jesus by my side, I am set free
Now I have iven, there's a new life for me
With Jesus by my side I am set free
