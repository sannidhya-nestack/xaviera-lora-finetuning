Carce Domine
Carce Populo tuo
Dei in eternum iros caris domis
Have mercy on me, God, in your kindness
In your compassion, God, have my offence
Oh, wash me more and more from my guilt
And cleanse me from my sin
Archidominem
Arce populo tuo
Ne in eternum mias caris nobis
My offences, truly I know them
My sin is always before me
Against you, you alone have I sinned
What is evil in your sight I have done
Parce domine, parce populo tuo
Ne in eternum iras caris nobis
O pure heart create for me, O God
Put a steadfast spirit within me
Arce Domine
Arčaj, poguljodu, neji ne teguj, i rastali stogi
