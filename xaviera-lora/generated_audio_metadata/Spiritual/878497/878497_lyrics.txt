Please wake up, Mr. Jesus
I've got troubles on my mind
I've been thinking'bout all the suffering
That you endured in your life
And how I blamed you for the pain in mine
And I'm sorry
And how I hope you can ive me
And how I pray you understand
Rescue me Jesus, I am lost
And I can't find my way back home
Dear Jesus, tell me why my life is gone so wrong
Tell me where my heart really belong
So I put my faith in my church
They coldly turned their back on me
So I walked away from my faith in God
And all that I believed
To never stop watching over me
And I thank you
I still remember your sacrifice
And for my sins you pay the ultimate price
Rescue me Jesus I am lost and I can't find my way back home
Dear Jesus tell me where my life has gone so wrong
And tell me where my heart really belongs
Rescue me Jesus, I am lost and I can't find my way back home
Dear Jesus, tell me where my life has gone so wrong
And tell me where my heart really belongs
Where do I belong?
Jesus
Mister Jesus
I hope you understand now why
Why I lost my way
Why I went astray
Jesus, can you hear me? Can you feel me?
I need you Jesus, I need you to understand
I need your help and hand, not Jesus
