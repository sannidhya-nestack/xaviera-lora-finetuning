Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Not be all else to me save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light
Be thou my wisdom, thou my true word
I ever with thee and thou with me would
Thou my great father and I thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with thee one
Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my sole shelter, Thou my high tower
Raise Thou me heavenward, O power of my power
High King of Heaven
Your victory won
Heart of my own heart
Whatever before
Whatever before
Oh, ruler of all
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art (Thou mine treasure)
Lord of my heart, be thou my vision, Lord of my heart, be thou my vision, Lord of my heart
