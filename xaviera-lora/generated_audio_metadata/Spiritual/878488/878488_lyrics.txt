You are the one
You love me more than I can ever comprehend
Like a father and a friend
You love me when I fall
And even when I stray
You love me more and more each day
Mighty God you are the one
Who rules the skies above
Mighty God you are the one
That saves the life I love
Mighty God you are the one who lives and breathes in me
Mighty God you are the one my everything
You live in every corner of my heart and soul
You live in every high and low
You live in every dream, in every last chance
You live in every second chance
Mighty God, you are the one who rules the skies above
Mighty God, you are the one, the source of all love
Mighty God, you are the one who lives and breathes in me
Mighty God, you are the one, my everything
My everything
You reign over all eternity
Your mighty will be done
Your mighty will be done
You reign over all eternity
Your kingdom will come
Your kingdom will come
You reign over all eternity
Your mighty will be done
Your mighty will be done
You reign over all eternity
Your kingdom will come
Your kingdom will come
Mighty God, you are the one
The rules of skies above, one night around
Mighty God, you are the one, the source of all love
Mighty God, you are the one who lives and breathes in me (the one for me)
Mighty God, you are the one my everything, Lord my everything
