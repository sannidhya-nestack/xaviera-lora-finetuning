Every little step I take
Path for me you will make
Gonna be sure I'm with you
And every time I read your word
Meditate till I've heard
From you
Hallelujah to my Lord, to my friend, to the one I love
Hallelujah, say it to me, say it to me, you're the one I love
Every day you must know, wherever you say I'll go, nothing too big or too small
Show me what it is you are
I never mean to disturb you
But trusting you will be your way
Hallelujah to my Lord
To my friend
To the one I love
Hallelujah stay to you
Stay to me
You're the one I love, hallelujah
Praise to peace, come to love
You're the one I love, hallelujah
As you die at night
For you're the one I love
Every little step I take
From the moment I'm away
The love for you I want to grow
Nothing gonna get me down
The joy you give I have found
Whatever I face you're with me
Hallelujah to my Lord
To my friend, to the one I love
Hallelujah thanks to you
Thanks in this Lord, the one I love
Hallelujah
All you want, daughter, what I love
Hallelujah, what I've begun
Rest in peace, daughter, what I love
