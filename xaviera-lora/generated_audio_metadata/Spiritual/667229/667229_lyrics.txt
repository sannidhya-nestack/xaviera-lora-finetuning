I left the world today when you were out
An angel called my name and I was gone
The sands of time have changed as I go my way
I will remember you
Think of good times, et the tears
Think of our love, a smile appears
An angel came my way, my dear
Our love withstood the test of time
The ups, the downs, the don't know whys
The joys we shared will last
As generations pass
Our love is here to stay
Think of good times
et the tears
Think of our love
A smile appears
An angel came my way
My dear
Our life is but a passing phase
We make our mark and then are raised
To ive each other now
To learn to give somehow
Our love is here to stay
Think of good times, et the tears
Think of our love, a smile appears
An angel came my way
My dear, I left the world today when you were out
An angel called my name and I was gone
The sands of time have changed as I go my way
I will remember you
