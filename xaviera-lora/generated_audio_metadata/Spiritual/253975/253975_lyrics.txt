Redeeming the time
For the days are evil
We need to occupy'til it comes
Isn't it wise
To lay aside this world
There's still a risk to be won
And when we stand on that day
We will hear the Lord say
Well done, my child, my faithful one
Oh, holy is the light
And that's where I wanna be
Walking hand in hand with my Lord
Don't you ever give up the fight
Just keep on loving Him with all your life
And you know He'll make you whole
Is He the Lord?
Just another hero
What will it take for you to be sold?
Like a treasure that's lost
In a field of stones
You mean more to him than you know
And when we stand on that day
We will hear the Lord say
Well done my child, my faithful one
Oh, holy is the light
And that's where I wanna be
Walking hand in hand with my Lord
Don't you ever give up the fight
Just keep on loving him with all your life
And you know he'll make you whole
Soon you will come like a thief in the night
Look all around you, the harvest is ripe
And there is a reason for everything
So come on believe, oh can't you see?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
And when we stand on that day
We will hear the Lord say
Well done, my child, my faithful one
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Oh, oh, holy is the light
And that's where I want to be
Walking hand in hand with my Lord
Don't you ever give up the fight
Just keep on loving him with all your life
And you know he'll make you whole
Oh, holy is the light
And that's where I wanna be
Walking hand in hand with my lord
Don't you ever give up the fight
Just keep on loving him with all your life
And you know he'll make you whole
Redeeming the time
For the days of evil
We need to shine his light'til he comes
