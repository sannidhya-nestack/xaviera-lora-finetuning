I Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine
For Thee all the fallings of sin I resign
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou
If ever I love Thee, my Jesus'tis now
I loved thee because thou hast first loved me
And carried my burden on Calvary's tree
I love thee for wearing the crown upon thy brow
If ever I loved thee, my Jesus'tis now
In mansions of glory and endless delight
I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright
I'll sing with the glittering crown upon my brow
If ever I love thee, my Jesus'tis now
My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine
To Thee all the bodies of sin I resign
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour, my God
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus'tis now
