This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Brighter than this little heart of mine
I'm gonna let it fall down much harder for you
Harder for you
There's a light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna hold you close, I'm gonna build you a fire
Don't be scared of the dark
Come on in, come on and catch my spark
This little world of ours grows
A million miles an hour, so
Stop and smell the flowers
Sometimes the sun don't shine and
Sometimes the silver lining's hiding
Behind clear blue skies
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna hold it close
I'm gonna beautify
Don't be scared of the dark
Oh, come on in
Come on and catch my spark
Candle burning, I'm rolling up my sleeve
Hold my hand so you can feel my heartbeat
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna hold it close
I'm gonna build you a fire
It's been so hard but fun
Oh, this little light
This little light
Of mine
Ooh
