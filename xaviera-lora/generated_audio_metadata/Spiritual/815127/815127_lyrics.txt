A whole lot of people tell us we should hit the bar
We could make it big, yes, we could be great country stars
Friend, we work for Jesus, and if you want us there, go ahead and book us
'Cause this is what we'll share
I don't need a ballroom angel
To make my nights complete
And I don't need those neon lights
Shining down on me
I serve a king named Jesus
He has set me free
I don't need a ballroom angel
my life is complete
If you're looking for the answers
To the questions in your life
Your heart is filled with sorrow and your days are filled with strife
Give it all to Jesus, He's waiting here for you
And no matter your temptation, my King will see you through
And I don't need a ballroom angel to make my nights complete
And I don't need those neon lights shining down on me
I serve a king named Jesus, he has set me free
I don't need a ballroom angel'cause my life is complete
And I don't need a ballroom angel to make my nights complete
And I don't need those neon lights shining down on me
I serve a king named Jesus, he has set me free
I don't need a ballroom angel'cause my life is complete
No, I don't need a ballroom angel'cause my life is complete
