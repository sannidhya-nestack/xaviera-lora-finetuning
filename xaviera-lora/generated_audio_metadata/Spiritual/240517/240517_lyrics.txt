There's a guy I ran into a year ago
Claims he's the author of love, I call him Romeo
Moved in in August while I was on vacation
Said he's not leaving, he's here for the duration
First thing I know, he scared away my girlfriend
Told me he'd find me another he could recommend
Oh, I'll admit he's the master of the pick-up line
But who is he to be messin' in what is mine?
He was right, it annoyed me
I see why love had avoided me
I'll admit though it killed me to save so
He opened my eyes now, I owe Romeo
I owe Romeo
Then he starts saying that all my stuff is really his
And how depressing obsession with possession is
How all my time I worry about my net worth
The pile of stuff I leave here when I'm in the earth
He was right, it annoyed me
I saw that selfishness had destroyed me
I confessed so it killed me to say so
You opened my heart now I owe Romeo
Oh Romeo
Five minutes with this guy
He'll change your point of view
You'll realize that all he said is true
Oh Romeo
One day you'll recognize you're becoming someone new
So just sit down, there's nothing you can do
He tells me someday we'll go and live in his place
Showed me the plans, yeah there's a lot of space
Said he'll fill it with friends of his from far and near
But in the meantime we'll work on building models here
I bet he's right how I enjoy it
I've seen the evidence nothing can destroy it
I confess though it kills me to say so
He brought me around now I owe Romeo
I'm Romeo, yeah I'm Romeo, yeah Romeo, Romeo
