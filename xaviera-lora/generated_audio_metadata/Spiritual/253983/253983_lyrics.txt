As I attempt the exercise
To sit down and journalize
Reflect upon my life
I focus on the details of events
So far removed
Those pivotal encounters
That shape my thoughts, my views
How could I?
Help but notice the trend too obvious to ignore
That you've intervened at every crossroads
Sending messengers but day to day
It's so easy to trivialize it now
To see the bigger picture now I recall them all
The sum of what you've done for me is almost too immense to grasp
I stand in awe and so completely overwhelmed
I am overwhelmed and so compelled
To cherish you as you have cherished me
When I was young and full of doubt
You reached down and sought me out
So subtle yet divine
A touch, a voice, a stranger's eyes
That held a hidden clue
Came when I least expected
To draw me home to you
How can I help but notice
The trend too obvious to ignore
That you intervene at every crossroads
Sending messengers
It's so easy to trivialize it and not to see the bigger picture now I recall'em all
The sum of what you've done for me is almost too immense to grasp
I stand in awe and so completely overwhelmed
I am overwhelmed and so
All compelled to cherish you as you have cherished me
Everything just to save my soul
But day to day
It's so easy to trivialize it
And not to see
The bigger picture now I recall them all
And the sum of what you've done for me is almost too immense to grasp
I stand in awe and so completely overwhelmed, overwhelmed
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
