There's a new day dawning, Jesus our Savior's calling
A gentle whisper shakes the ground
Clothing, grace and glory
Fought so long before me
King of kings has come to take me home
Take me home
When my spirit flies away and I finally see your face
There will be days of wonder, there will be days of wonder
When this world is all begun, the battles won, your kingdom come
There will be days of wonder, there will be days of wonder
No pain and no more crying
No death and no one mourning
Jesus washed my tears away
Lamb and Lord Almighty shine
In the holy city
Night and day we praise your holy name
Holy name
When my spirit flies away
And I finally see your face
There will be days of wonder
There will be days of wonder
When this world is all but gone
The battles won, your kingdom come
There will be days of wonder
There will be days of wonder
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Debt's been paid
The road's been laid out
Heaven's glory is before us
The debt's been paid
The road's been laid out
Heaven's glory is before us
The debt's been paid
The road's been laid out
Heaven's glory is before us
The dead's been paid
The rose been laid out
Heaven's glory is before us
Heaven's glory is before us
Heaven's glory is before us
When my spirit flies away and I finally see your face
There will be days of wonder, there will be days of wonder
When this world is all but gone, the battles won, your kingdom come
There will be days of wonder, there will be days of wonder
When my spirit flies
When my spirit flies away
There will be days of wonder
Of wonder
Of wonder
