Yes, you are, yeah
When you found me
Nothing but darkness around me all of the time
Then you changed me
You took my life
Rearranged me now I'm just fine
Our love saved us
It made us all that we dreamed we could be
Because love took us by the hand, set us free
Ah, yes it did
No more crying, I'm spreading my wings
And I'm flying high as the sky
Yes, I'm free now
Know what it's like to be me, I can see why
you love me, above me
There'll never be anyone
Love keeps making me feel that I'm number one
Why else it does?
I think it's easier still
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I know why I'm going through life with my head high
I'm doing fine, I've got my pride now
I've got no more reason to hide because you're mine
I'm a winner
A beginner, we're gonna go all the way
Because love gave us one more chance, one more day
Oh, yes it did, thank you Jesus, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yes it did
Thank you Jesus, oh yeah yeah
