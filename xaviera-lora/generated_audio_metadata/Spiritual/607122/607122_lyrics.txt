Why should I feel discouraged? And why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely?
And long for heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion
My constant friend is He
His eyes is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
For His eyes is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Yes, I sing because I'm happy
Yes, I sing because I'm free
His eyes is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
