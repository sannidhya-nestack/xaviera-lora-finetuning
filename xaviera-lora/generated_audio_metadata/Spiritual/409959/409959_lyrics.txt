You are shepherd to me
All that I need you're providing
Lord I will trust in you
And follow wherever you're guiding
Though the dark should invade
Still I won't be afraid
You are my strength and shield
On every side my defender
Ever before me a flame
Lighting my path with his splendor
Though the dark should invade
Still I won't be afraid
I will call upon You, Jesus, You are faithful, You are faithful
And I will sing a thousand praises to Your glory, to Your glory
This is the way of faith
Unveiling mysteries glorious
This is the conquering power
That over the world is victorious
Though the dark should invade
Still I won't be afraid
I will call upon you Jesus
You are faithful, you are faithful
And I will sing a thousand praises
To your glory, to your glory
Though the dark should invade
Still I won't be afraid
And I have a seed
And I will sing a thousand praises
And I will call upon you Jesus
You are faithful, you are faithful
And I will sing a thousand praises to your glory
To your glory and I will call upon you Jesus
You are faithful, you are faithful and I will sing a thousand praises
To your glory, to your glory
I will sing to you, I will sing to you, I will worship you
Great is your faithfulness, great is your faithfulness
Great is your faithfulness, great is your faithfulness unto me Lord
Great is your faithfulness, great is your faithfulness
Great is your faithfulness unto me
And you will soon a thousand come
