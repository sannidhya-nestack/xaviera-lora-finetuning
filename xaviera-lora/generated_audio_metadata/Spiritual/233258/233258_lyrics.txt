Love is the key, joy to an open door
Love, can't you see it in all?
Love, love supreme
Overall it's just a daily dream
Why is it now so important to me?
Now or never (never before)
Standing whatever is in the way of you and me
Stand up and claim the throne
Stand up and say you'll always be
My everlasting love
And ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Be the center of my universe
I will stand tall
You, you can depend on me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I stand tall for the good
And the in between will be one of a kind
Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, ever and ever and ever, ever and ever, ever, ever, ever
