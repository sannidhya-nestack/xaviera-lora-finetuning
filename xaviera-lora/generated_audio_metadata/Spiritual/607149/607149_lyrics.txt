Last night I cried my last tear for you
My dear for you
Last night
Last night my heart said its last goodbye
To welcome this new man of mine
Last night
No more lonely nights
Just sunsets over the horizon
No more stormy seas
Yet calm and still ocean breeze
My way today
there's a new man in my life
And I'd like to introduce him tonight
He's unlike any man I know
And his love I just can't let go
There's a new man in my life
And I'd like to introduce him tonight
He showed me what love is like
And for that I've given him my life
Last night I took my first walk alone
But really I wasn't alone
Last night, last night I cried my first tea of joy
The feeling I couldn't avoid
Last night
No more lonely nights, just sunsets over the horizon
No more stormy seas, yet calm and still
Ocean breeze my way today
there's a new man in my life
And I'd like to introduce him tonight
He's unlike any man I know
And his love I just can't let go
There's a new man in my life
And I'd like to introduce him tonight
He showed me what love is like
And for that I've given him my life
when I'm feeling low and all alone
He's all I need and when I'm feeling low
Can't go on (I can't go on)
He restores my soul
And no matter what I'm going through
He's the man for me
there's a new man in my life
And I'd like to introduce him tonight
He's a like any man I know
And his love I can't let go
Say what's his name? (what's his name?)
Tell me, tell me, tell me (tell me)
What's his name? (Oooh)
His name is Jesus
