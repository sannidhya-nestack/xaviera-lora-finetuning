When you are here your glory fills this place
The skies are torn and glory fills this place
And heaven overflows and glory floods out
We'll wait until your glory fills this place
We'll praise your name till glory fills this place
Heaven overflows
And glory floods our souls
We bow down, we cry out with the angels holy, holy, holy
We bow down, we cry out earth and heaven can't contain your glory
When you are here your glory fills this place
The skies are torn and glory fills this place
Heaven overflows and glory floods out
We bow down, we cry out with the angels
Holy, holy, holy
We bow down, we cry out
Earth and heaven can't contain your glory
Heaven overflows, and glory floods our souls
Heaven overflows, and glory floods our souls
We bow down, we cry out with the angels
Holy, holy, holy
We bow down, we cry out
Earth and heaven can't contain your glory
We bow down, we cry out with the angels
Angels, holy, holy, holy
We bow down, we cry out
Earth and heaven can't contain
The earth and heaven can't contain your glory
Show us your glory, Lord
