Well, the doctor's going in on Monday
But I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
And I haven't had much sleep since Sunday
Been up all night, been up all night
He said if you believe in Jesus son then you'll have nothing to fear
Cause even if you die you'll live a million years
Well the doctor's going in on Monday
But I'll be alright, yeah I'll be alright
Well my life has been filled with good fortune
And I have had nothing to fear
I've never felt the weight of hatred
And I've never shed a tear
I believe in Jesus and I have nothing to fear
I know when I die, I'll live a million years
Well, the doctor's going in on Monday
But I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
He says if you believe in Jesus, son, then you'll have nothing to fear
even if you die, you'll live a million years
Well, the doctor's going in on Monday
But I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Well, this life has been free from trouble
And here's what I'm saying to you
Don't ever take things for granted
And be true in whatever you do
If you believe in Jesus
Then you'll have nothing to fear
Cause even when you die
You'll live a million years
Well the doctor's going in on Monday
But I'll be alright
Yeah I'll be alright
