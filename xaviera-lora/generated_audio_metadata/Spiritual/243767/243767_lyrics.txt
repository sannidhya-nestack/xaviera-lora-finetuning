I've been fighting hard, y'all, but something's going on
I got hit, I was praying, I was fasting
And now I'm going through
Has that ever happened to you? You know what I mean
War clothes on, fasting for power
Praying through every text, God's person for the hour
Took a hit, it seems so unfair
Where is my Lord now? Does He really care?
Pressed on every side, afraid you're gonna die
Losing the strength to fight
No relief inside train
Your focus on high
Head waggers passing by
You can rest assured
Your fate will endure
Play the fine dresser
He's dressing up the line
Rejoice anyhow, it's pruning time
You don't understand it, you stand for do-si-free
But pruning only means, he's got more for you to do
Oh, somebody's vine dressing, is dressing up the vine
It's pruning time (It's only pruning time)
You don't understand it (You don't understand it)
You've been producing fruit (You've been producing fruit)
But pruning only means (Pruning only means)
He's got more for you to do
If you don't understand (you don't understand)
And can't encourage me (you can't help me)
Don't try to deter me (move out of the way)
I'm moving on you see (I gotta go on with Jesus)
The Lord is holding me (He's holding me)
While He's molding me (molding me)
For more delivery (for more delivery)
In His vineyard you see
The mighty (the mighty)
(Jesus) is dressing up the vine (dressing up the vine)
Rejoice anyhow (rejoice anyhow)
It's prune itself (it's only prune)
You don't understand it (you don't understand it)
You stay producing (you stay producing)
But pruning don't let me, yeah (pruning don't let me)
He's got more for you to do, hey (he's got more for you to do)
If you don't understand it (you don't understand it)
Watch it for me through the window (the Lord's got your back)
The Lord's got your back (He's taking care of you)
He's taking care of you (He's dressing up the vine, yeah)
Oh yes, yes, it's pruning time (because it's pruning time)
If you don't understand it all
He's got your back and he's gonna take real good care of you
He's dressing up the vine, yeah
It's pruning time Lord, trust me
Dress me up, I'm dressed up (dress me up, I'm dressed up)
The battle's getting hot, dress me up (dress me up, I'm dressed up)
I refuse to stop (dress me up, dress me up, I'm dressed up)
It's getting hot, it's getting hot (dress me up, dress me up, I'm dressed up)
I refuse to stop (dress me up, dress me up, I'm dressed up)
The battle's getting hot, Lord, dress me up (dress me up, I'm dressed up)
