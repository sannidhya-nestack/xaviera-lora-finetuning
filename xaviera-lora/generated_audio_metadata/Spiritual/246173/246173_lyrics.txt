I spent a lot of days bowing down to him
Laying my worries at the throne
I spent a lot of nights kneeling in his presence
Thanking him for mercy and love unknown
Then I hear a whisper as he's calling to me
Saying it's time to get up off my knees and turn around
Go and share my word, let my voice be heard
Turn around, you can help them see
The mercy found in me
Stand up speak out about the love you found
You can't touch a lonely life if you just turn around
Looking over my shoulder I see a million people
Searching for answers on where to start while my back is to them
I know they're all waiting
Waiting for the love that's in my heart
What started as a whisper
Sounds like thunder to me
Saying it's time to get up off my knees and turn around
Go and share my word, let my voice be heard
Turn around, you can help them see
The mercy found in me
Stand up speak out about the love you found
You can't touch a lonely light
If you just turn around
Each step will bring me closer
To the ones who are in need
Until one day
They will hear those words
He said to me
Go and share my word
Let my voice be heard
Turn around
You can help them see
The mercy found in me
Stand up speak out
About the love you found
You can touch a lonely life
You can't touch a lonely life if you just turn around
