Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, uh
This is a story, story'bout love
Not any love but that love from above
A love that never falls to time
A love that never undermines
This is that real deal, not just that feeling deal
It don't just go away, it stays strong everyday
That love it started, started long ago
You wonder why I say, this is how I know
God's love, is that real love
It don't change love, everlasting love
God's love, is that real love? It don't change love, everlasting love
Now I was deep in sin, lost in my own ways
Looking for a friend, struggling from day to day
I had no peace, had no joy inside
I had no longing for this troubled life
I met a man who lived some years ago
He told me about his father who loved this world so
So much he sacrificed, gave his only son
It's the only reason I can know about this love called
God's love, it's that real love
It don't change love, everlasting love
God's love, it's that real love
It don't change love, everlasting love
God's love is that real love (is that real love)
It don't change love (it don't change love)
Everlasting love (oh)
God's love, it's that real love
It don't change love, everlasting love
Tell me'bout a friend who will stick closer than a brother
For a freakin' thing
Tell me'bout a friend who through anything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (stays'til the end)
Still searching, can't find (nobody but God's love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's that real love
That real friend (it don't change love)
Don't change (everlasting love)
Every day's the same
God's love
God's love (it's that real love)
Yeah, yeah (it don't change love)
Don't change love (everlasting love)
Everlasting love
God's love
God's love (it's that real love)
Cause love is that real love (it don't change love, it don't change love)
Everlasting love (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Cause love is that real love (that real love)
It don't change love (it don't change love)
Everlasting love (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cause love
It's that real love (love so good)
It don't change love (love so good)
Everlasting love (I can count on it)
God's love (Monday, Tuesday)
It's that real love (Wednesday, Thursday)
It don't change love (Friday, Saturday)
Everlasting love (especially on Sunday)
God's love (I can count it)
It's that real love (three, three, three, sixty-five)
It don't change love (24 /7)
Everlasting love (when I look to my left)
