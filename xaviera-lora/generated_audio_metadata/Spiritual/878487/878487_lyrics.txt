All to Jesus I surrender
All to Him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all
All to Jesus
All to Jesus, I surrender
At Thy feet I humbly bow
Worthy pleasures all forsaken
Take me Jesus, take me now
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Saviour Lord
I surrender all
All to Jesus I surrender
Make me Saviour, Holy Thine
Let me feel the Holy Spirit
Truly know that Thou art mine
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee my blessed Savior
Now I surrender
I surrender all of my life
To Your mercy and grace
To Your wonderful glorious plans
All of my life to your mercy and grace
To your wonderful glorious man
All to Jesus I surrender
All to him I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all
