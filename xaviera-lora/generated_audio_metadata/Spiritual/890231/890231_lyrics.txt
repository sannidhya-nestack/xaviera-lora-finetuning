Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Even though it be a cross that raised me
Still all my song shall be
Fall like the wanderer, the sun gone down
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'll be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, to Thee
Free from joyful wing
Cleave in the sky
Sun, moon and stars for God
Upward I fly
Still all my song shall be
Nearer my God
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, to Thee
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Here am I, God, to Thee
