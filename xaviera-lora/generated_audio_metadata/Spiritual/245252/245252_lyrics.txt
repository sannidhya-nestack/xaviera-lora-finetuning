Mm-hmm
Says the Lord
I formed you in your mother's womb
And you are wonderfully made
Says the Lord, I have loved you
With everlasting love
And it's you I came to save
Ooh, God, you spoke the stars into the skies
Ooh, and I am the work of your hands
You have given me a life abundantly
So I ask you with everything I am
Lord, watch over me
Lord, watch over me
Keep me under your wing
Lord watch over me, over me
Over me well
Says the Lord, I will put you in a pleasant place
And I will keep you secure
Says the Lord, I have plans for you
And you know it's true
That my plans always endure
God you spoke the waters into the seas
And I am the work of your hand
You have given me life abundantly
So I ask you everything I am
Lord, watch over me
Lord, watch over me
Come on and keep me under your wing
Under your wings, Lord
Lord, watch over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard
What the Lord has in store for those who love Him
Save
Silver Lord, you will seek me and find me
When you seek me with all of your heart
You will call on me
And I will set you free (set you free, yeah)
Free to rise, to fly, and free to soar (free to soar)
God, you spoke the weed into the fields
And I am the work of your hand
You have given me life abundantly
So I ask you everything I am
Lord watch over me (I need you to watch over me)
Lord watch over me
Keep me under your wing, oh Lord
Lord, watch over me
Lord, watch over me (Lord, watch over me)
Lord, watch over me (Keep me)
Don't keep me under your wing
Love, watch over me
Lord watch over me (over me) over me (over me)
Lord watch over me (over me) over me, over me (over me)
Lord watch over me (over me) over me (over me)
Lord watch over me (over me) over me (over me)
