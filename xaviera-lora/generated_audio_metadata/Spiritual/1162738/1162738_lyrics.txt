For today you become king
So claim your kingdom, son
You'll overcome everything
For you are the chosen one
Rise for me my only child
Don't you despair
Let our faith be reconciled
And bring on the love that's fair
He rose from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
We are bound by love
Giving us more than enough
He rose from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
Searching for a soul to save
On through the violent storm
And through the darkest night
Through every twist and turn
He will be the light, the light
He rose from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
We are bound by love
Giving us more than enough
He rose from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
For my soul to save
Heroes from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
We are bound by love
You're giving us more than enough
Heroes from the grave
Searching for a soul to save
Searching for a soul to save
