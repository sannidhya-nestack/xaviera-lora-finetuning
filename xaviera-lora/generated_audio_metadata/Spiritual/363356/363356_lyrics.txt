But when I think of how they treated you
It goes beyond my understanding
You gave your all and still ave them all
You were kind, you were loving
Even on the cross
So many times I've gone astray
Only to find I've lost my way
But like a good shepherd you are there
To guide me
And though I don't deserve your love
You smile at me from up above
Letting me know you're always near
And when my time on earth is over
You'll be there to take me home
You gave your all only to save my soul
You were kind, you were loving
Even on the cross
When my time on earth is over
You'll be there to take me home
You gave your all only to save us all
You were kind, you were loving, even on the cross
You were kind, you were loving, even on the cross
