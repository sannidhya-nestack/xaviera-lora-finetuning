I want peace and trust and to live my life
To be in the moment knowing I'm alive
To stay up at each step of the way
To have the best of every day
To live my truth, to drop my lies
To break through illusion, the clouds, my mind
To give all that I want to receive
To have deeper faith, to manifest my dreams
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
Health and happiness to all I know
To reap the good that I sow
The gratitude as pain is healed
Wisdom and courage are revealed
Greater compassion than life force
Higher life state is my reward
I let go as I ive
The past is no longer where I live
I want peace and trust and to live my life
To be in the moment knowing I'm alive
To stay up any step of the way
To have the best of every day
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
Now I'm on my way
