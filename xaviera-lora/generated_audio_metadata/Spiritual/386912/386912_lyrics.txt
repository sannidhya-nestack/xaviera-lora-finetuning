I don't understand his ways
When I've seen the things he's seen
I don't understand the reason
But they tell me he is king
Yet I don't care
For him or them
I don't read the great book anymore
I don't believe in black or white
Lord, we've got so much to talk about
Things in this world ain't right
I don't believe in preachers
I don't believe in war
I don't believe in you anymore
I see children being crushed
A mother's tears through the dust
This mother's grief in a foreign land
Greater than yours, come hold my hand
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you
