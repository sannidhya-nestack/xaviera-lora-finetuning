In the fresh air, the hours of the brand new day
I'm waking, hair undone, still sleeping nice
My heart has heard you say
Come here my child and talk with me
And my heart responds, Lord I'm coming
I'm coming
Where you are, waiting and waiting
With open arms, with open ears
To embrace my pain, to hear my plea
Though my mind cannot comprehend how the key
Who holds us tight into place sits with me
Day after day
My sweet hour of prayer
When he shows me the palm of his hands
And there I see my name
As he raises me higher and higher
Into his presence
My sweet hour of prayer
Do you not know? Have you not heard?
The everlasting God, Creator
Will give new strength to those who wait upon Him
They will mount with wings like eagles
They will run and not get tired
They will walk and not be weary
So I'm coming
When you are waiting and waiting with open arms, with open ears
To embrace my pain, to hear my plea
Though my mind cannot comprehend how the king
Who holds the stars unto blessed with me
Day after day, my sweet hour of prayer
Where He shows me the palm of His hands
And there I see my name
As He raises me higher and higher into His presence
My sweet hour of power
