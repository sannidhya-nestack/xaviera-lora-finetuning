Thinking back when I was young, we'd mess around, go out and have fun, oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Climb the mountain if we dared, we'd stay up late and no one cared, oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Waking up at half past twelve, I'm feeling good about myself
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
All the fast food takeaways and living life out day by day
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Late summer nights sitting around
Till the morning light
It was also you
Growing up we never stayed in touch
But I know you care
And I still got time for you
Thinking back when I was young
We'd mess around, go out and have fun
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Climb the mountain if we dared
We'd stay up late and no one cared
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Waking up at half past twelve, I'm feeling good about myself
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
All the fast food takeaways and living life out day by day
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Late summer nights, sitting around'til the morning light
It was all so new, growing up we never stayed in touch
But I know you care, and I still got time for you
