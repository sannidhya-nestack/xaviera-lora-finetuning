You're keeping track of all my sorrow
You're writing it down in your book of life
You're collecting my tears in a bottle
And when we meet we'll pour them out
Pour them into the river
Watch them flow and fade away
Fill my soul with laughter
And we'll feast upon the endless day
Nobody really knows the crosses that I bear
Put on my habit face, pretend that they're not there
You'll hold my heart, keep the promises you make
And make sure the burden isn't more than I can take
You're keeping track of all my sorrow
You're writing it down in your book of life
You're collecting my tears in a bottle
And when we meet we'll pour them out
Into the river
Watch them flow and fade away
Fill my soul with laughter
And we'll feast upon the endless day
You are the reason I don't want to have my way (have my way)
You put my feet back on the pathway when I stray
Hold me still and tell me that my debts have all been paid
And keep me from lying on the bed that I have made
You're keeping track of all my sorrow
You're writing it down in your book of life
You're collecting my tears in a bottle
And when we meet, we'll pour them out
Pour them into the river
Watch them flow and fade away
Fill my soul with laughter
And we'll feast upon the endless day
Ooh, ooh, ooh
