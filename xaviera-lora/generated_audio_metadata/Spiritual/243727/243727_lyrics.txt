We won't let go (We won't let go, we won't let go)
Until you bless us, won't let go (We won't let go until we feel your hand)
We will not leave this place, we'll only seek your face
We won't let go (We won't let you to bless our hearts once again)
Old Jacob wrestled with you, Lord, trying to find your will
Well, here we are, your children, and we're wandering still
Why did you make us like this? What were we created for?
And we won't leave here until we're sure (We won't let go)
We won't let go, we won't let go (Until you bless us)
We won't let go until we feel your hand
We will not leave this place, we'll only seek your face
We won't let go (we won't let go)
To bless our hearts once again
Why have we left so many times filled with doubt and shame
You've called us sons and daughters and you know us by name
Does your love still surround us does your mercy endure
Well we won't leave here until we're sure
We won't let go we won't let go we won't let go
Until you bless us won't let go we won't let go until we feel good
We will not leave this place
We'll only seek your face
We won't let go (we won't let go)
To bless our hearts once again
We'll just let go (we'll let go)
Of our un iveness
We'll let go (we'll let go)
And we'll hold on (we'll hold on) to your every promise till you fill our hearts once again (we won't let go) we won't let go (we won't let go) till you bless us (won't let go) we won't let go (till we feel your hand) we will not leave this place, we'll only seek your face, we won't let go (we won't let go) till you bless our hearts once again (we won't let go) we won't let go (till you bless our hearts once again)
We won't let go, we won't let go, we won't let go
