He was the Word, the Word was with God
When time begun and for a while dwelt among men
Through him all things were made
Heaven and earth, the universe
And all there is in him there's life
The light of man that shines in the dark
Little light, I have seen it now, I'll never walk in darkness, never again, ah-ah-ah
Little love, he has touched me now, I'll never be the same again
Ever again
This world is leaving
Waters flowing from the throne of God
Bathing my soul to holiness
Sweetly running
Gently carrying me to where you are
Where I find love
Where I'm restored
Reborn, unmade new, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live in waters I drank freely, now I'm there ever first again, never again
Bread I ate freely now I'll never ever hunger
Never again, never again
Never will I walk in darkness
Never will I be afraid
Never will I be without a home again
Never will I thirst and hunger
Never will I be alone
Never will I be the same again
Never again, ooh, never again
