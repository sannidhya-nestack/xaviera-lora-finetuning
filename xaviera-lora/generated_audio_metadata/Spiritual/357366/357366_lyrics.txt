Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No matter how hard that you try
To hide behind your smile
There's a voice that cries, that whispers
The story of your life
No matter how hard that you try to
Pretend that you don't feel
The void within your soul is real
Can't help to reveal
The story of your life (your story)
Doesn't have to be the sad one
You've chosen to write (your story)
If you let God's love come in
A new page will begin (new page)
The story of your life
Can have a happy ending (yes)
And even secrets that you think
No one could ever know
Down in your spirit there's a place
Where only God can go
And He'll erase every fear
And take away the shame
If you give it love permission
There's healing in His name
Story of your life
Doesn't have to be the sad one you've chosen to write
And if you let good love come in, a new page will begin
And then the story of your love can have a happy ending
No, it's not over
No, it's not too late
Though you sealed your destiny
You can go another way
The basement be loaded
You still let out the game
Your life may be broken
Put an end
A picture in the frame
If you let God's love come in
A new page will begin
And then the story of your life (your story)
Can have a happy ending
Life story
From pain to glory
All you need is love
Change your life story
From pain to glory
All you need is love
Let it in
If you're loving then your life begins
And your story it won't have to end
Oh let it in
Oh let it in
If you live loving then your life begins
And your story won't have to end
Oh let it in, oh let it in
