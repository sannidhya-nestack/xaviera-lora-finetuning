You are my vision, my only vision
You are the ribbon around my soul
Your eyes see through me, your words renew me
You are the hand I want to hold
You are my vision, my greatest vision
You are the heaven that lights the dark
You are my reason, my gift of freedom
You are the breath inside my heart
I was like a river running dry
I'd otten how to sing and dance and fly
I'd given up on everything just trying to survive
Then you threw the moon and stars into my eyes
You are my vision, my sweetest vision
You are the crimson that paints the rose
When winter finds me, you're right beside me
You are the spring that melts the snow
I was like a river running dry
I'd otten how to sing and dance and fly
I'd given up on everything just trying to survive
Then you threw the moon and stars into my eyes
The sun and moon and stars into my eyes
Lord you are my vision, my only vision
