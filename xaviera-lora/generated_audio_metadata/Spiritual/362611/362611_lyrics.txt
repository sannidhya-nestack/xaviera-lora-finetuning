People talking all over town
They're complaining about who's letting them down
But do they appreciate the simple things?
Not seeing and feeling what love can bring
Got to get away from the feeling
Of all the violence and hate that we're dealing
'Cause we may lose it all without ever really knowing what we have, oh
It'll be a new day arising
It's gonna be a brand new day, a whole new way
It'll be a new day a-risin'
There's something we can do
Better life for me and you
It'll be a new day a-risin',
It's gonna be a brand new day,
A whole new way
It'll be a new day a-risin',
Stop wasting your time
Our future's on the line baby
Not trying to change everybody
First I have to change myself
Tired of all this talk about money
When the simple life is what it's all about
Selfishness is the name of the game
And we're all to blame
'Til we help one another
we help each other
It'll be a new day arising
There's something we can do
A better life for me and you
It'll be a new day arising
It's gonna be a brand new day
A whole new way
It'll be a new day a-risin'
Stop wasting your time
Our future's on the line, baby (It'll be a new day a-risin')
Oh, it's time for a change, we've got to rearrange
Come on up, get on your feet and move it
Come on up now
Change your mind and get to it
Waste no time
The world is calling
Come on people
Before we're falling
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It'll be a new day arising
It's gonna be a brand new day
A whole new way
It'll be a new day arising
Oh, got to change our ways
We got to rearrange
It'll be a new day arising
Oh, there's something we can do
A better life for me and you
It'll be a new day rising (Oh, oh, baby)
