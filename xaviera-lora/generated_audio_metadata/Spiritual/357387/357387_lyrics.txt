Billie's bartering bottle tops
Suzie's selling her soul
Tied up and twisted and all of my mystics
Can't steal the grace that I hold
Such a long way down
Such a long, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna go to Miami and leave behind my world
And ignore all the prices of these sacrifices
And void all the debts I've incurred
it's such a long way down
It's such a long way down to the ground
Where can I go tonight?
What can I do to shower the least bit of love
Why do I need to change
Well baby sing me a story and soothe my mind
Don't talk of war, the weary, the poor
But speak of this love one more time
I've lavished my loved ones
And I've listened to friends
And my mercy's been spent on the biweekly rent
Of the company I'm comfortable in
it's such a long way down
It's such a long way down
It's such a long way down
It's such a long way down
And where can I go tonight?
What can I do to shower the least bit of light?
Why do I need to change this time?
And isn't there someone who loves more than I
And I try out on the boulevard
And tonight I'm not very far
But I'll talk to you like you're not here
And I'll say the words that you want to hear
it's such a long way down, yeah
It's such a long way down
And it's such a long way down
And it's such a long way down
It's such a long way down
It's such a long way down
To the ground, ba-bum, ba-bum, da-da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
La-da-dum, la-da-dum, da-dum-dum, dum-dum
