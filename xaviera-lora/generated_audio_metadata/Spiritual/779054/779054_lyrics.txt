You left this world and me behind, suddenly one night
Before I even had a chance to whisper you goodbye
At least I know you're not alone
You're safe in God's pure love
At least I know you've found a home with all of the above
I wish I had just one more day for you to spend with me
I wish we had just one more night
But it wasn't meant to be
At least I know you're not alone
You're safe in God's pure love
At least I know you found a home with all of the above
I love you more than my own life
My love is stronger than death
And I know I'm gonna love you to the end
I hope someday to join you there in his celestial choir
But all I have to comfort me'til then
Is the knowledge that you're somewhere free from any pain
And you don't have to watch this world while it goes insane
At least I know you're not alone
You're safe in God's pure love
At least I know you found a home with all of the above
At least I know you found a home
With all of the above
All of the above
All of the above
