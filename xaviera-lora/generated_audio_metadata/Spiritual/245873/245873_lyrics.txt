I rely on you
I'm saved by your love
All that's simple and pure
Comes from above
A cold clean mountain stream
A real life rainbow dream
Everything
Comes from you
I rely on you
You planted the seed
Nurtured through your vine
Sown in your creed
My life is always in your hands
You helped me through shifting sands
I look to you in all that I do
Where was I so dark and alone
But you found me
And brought me back home
And you were there all along
As I was searching and going wrong
The door was open, now I'm home
Home singing your song
I rely on you, your love sets me free
Healed by your grace all you've done for me
Now I'll always go your way
Your spirit guides me every day
My life is true when I'm following you
Ooh, well it's a
It's so dark and alone
But you found me
And brought me back home
And you were there all along
As I was searching and going wrong
You were waiting and now I'm home singing your song
Home singing your song
I rely on your love
I rely on you
I rely on you
