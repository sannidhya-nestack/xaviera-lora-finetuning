While shepherds kept their watching over wandering flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shone a holy light
Go tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountains, over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountains that Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
