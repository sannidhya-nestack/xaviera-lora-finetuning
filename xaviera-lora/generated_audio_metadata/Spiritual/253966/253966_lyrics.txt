The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want
He makes me to lie down in green pastures in peace
He leads me by still waters
He restores my soul
The Lord is my shepherd
I will not be in want
You are my shepherd
He guides me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for he is my God
Fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
The Lord
The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want, He makes me to lie down
In green pastures in peace
He leads me by still waters
He restores my soul
The Lord is my shepherd
I will not be in want
You are my shepherd
You prepare a table before me
In the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil
My cup overflows
Only goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
I will dwell in the house of the Lord evermore
The Lord
The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want
He makes me to lie down in green pastures in peace
He leads me by still waters, He restores my soul. The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want. The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want.
The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in want
