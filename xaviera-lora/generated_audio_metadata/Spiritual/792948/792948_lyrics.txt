I had my dreams, you know I served them very well
I gave them all my nights and all my days
But now it seems I'm just an empty shell
I'm lost with no direction in a maze
There's only one thing on which you can rely
When all of your dreams have died
God's love is stronger than death
When everything you live for
Shatters like the waves upon the shore
God's love is stronger than death
When all you think you understand
Slips away like sand through your hands
God's love is stronger than death
Stronger than death, I know
It's been a while since the last time I got on my knees
And prayed with all the passion in my soul
Too many miles I stumbled to my calvary
Not knowing I was out of control
Spent all my time with my eyes on a prize
That was only a pack of lies
God's love is stronger than death
When everything you live for
Shatters like the waves upon the shore
God's love is stronger than death
Stronger than death when all you think you understand
Slips away like sand through your hands
God's love is stronger than death, stronger than death, I know
Should I find some new distraction, take a spin in my Corvette?
Should I take a long vacation, buy the Vegas and make a bent?
Should I get myself a hobby, or count all my regrets?
Only one choice will set me free
God's love is stronger than death
When everything you live for
Shatters like the waves upon the shore
God's love is stronger than death
When all you think you understand
Slips away like sand through your hands
God's love is stronger than death
Stronger than death
It's been a while since the last time I got on my knees
Prayed with all the passion in my soul
