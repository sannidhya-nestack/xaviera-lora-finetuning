I will be there when you call
now my back's against the wall
I've made my choice and I will follow through
I know when I see you smile
And all this crap was all worthwhile
And I'll be home for good
Home for good
Home for good
You've built a brand new home for me
And I'll move in eventually
Where it is furnished with the treasures that I stored away
And I may break but I won't bend
When my struggles at its end
I'll be home for good
Home for good
Home for good
Home for good
We will leap for joy like little lambs led out to pasture
Worry free forevermore
All us children singing, circling around our master
I will sing
I will sing
I will sing forevermore
When life is tough or even worse or poor
I concentrate on what's in store
My Holy Father will not let me fall or fade away
And I'll be playing in the park
No more crying in the dark
And I'll be home for good
Home for good
Home for good
Home for good
Home for good
