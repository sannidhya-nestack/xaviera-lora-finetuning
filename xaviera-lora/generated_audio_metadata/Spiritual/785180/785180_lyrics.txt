My name is Jesus and I know who you are
I've seen the future and I bear your scars
A change it is coming
You better beware
Like a thief in the night
I will come, I'll be everywhere
I saw you dance
On poor children's graves
Cry tears of a clown
Lucifer's slave
There's no turning back
From the things you have done
You acted so cruel in the night
The devil's own fool
Yes it's true that there's a heaven
And you go there from this earth
And Mary is my mother
And we were the virgin birth
And it's true that I died
That you might live again
There's still time to turn to me my friend
Some say I'm a hero
Some say I'm a man
But I can walk on water
And no one else can
The devil he knows me
And he can't hide his fear
Like a flash of light
I will strike if he comes near
My name is Jesus and I know who you are
I've seen the future and I bear your scars
A change is coming, you better be ready
Better be aware
Like a thief in the night
I will come, I'll be everywhere
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la
Yes it's true that there's a heaven
And you go there from this earth
And Mary is my mother
And we were the virgin birth
And it's true that I died
That you might live again
There's still time to turn to me my friend
Yes there's still time to turn to me my friend
