We could be better to each other
And I know we both have had our doubts
There is an angel deep inside of you
Waiting for you to let it out
And all the stars are falling from the sky for you
Only for you
And if it seems like everything is turning blue
Nothing but blue
Hold on to me, yeah
You can hold on to me, yeah
Hold on to me, yeah
Maybe you thought it was a waste of time
To hear the music in your heart
Just when it seems like everything is fine
That's when it all just falls apart
And the world keeps turning round and round for you
Only for you
And if it seems like everything is turning
Nothing but blue
Hold on to me, yeah
You can hold on to me, yeah
Hold on to me, yeah
I'll be holding on to you
I'll be holding on to you
I'll be holding on to you
Please come to my rescue
And if you feel like you are all alone
A desert island in the sea
I'll be the water rushing to your shore
you were like paradise to me
And the sun is shining clear and bright for you
Only for you
And if it seems like everything is turning blue
Beautiful blue
Hold on to me, yeah
You can hold on to me
Hold on to me, yeah
