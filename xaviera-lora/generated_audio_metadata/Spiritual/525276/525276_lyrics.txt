Thank God, thank God
We're way back home to Him and through the cross
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Every day when you're out there on the street
Pass the word, tell everyone you meet
Be careful, the devil's out running round
He's in a great big hurry'cause he knows just what's going down
Thank God, thank God
For a way back home to Him through the cross
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Pray every day keep your angels close at hand
Give praise to God for his holy plan
Be careful the devil's out running round
He's in a great big hurry cause he knows just what's going down
Well thank God
Well thank God
For a way back home to Him through the cross
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
Without Jesus we'd all be lost
