There's within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low
Fear not, I am with thee, peace be still
In all of life's ebb and flow
All my life was wrecked by sin and strife
Discord filled my heart with pain
Jesus swept across the broken strings
Stirred the slumbering chords again
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go
Feasting on the riches of His grace
Resting'neath His sheltering wing
Always looking on His smiling face
That is why I shout and sing
Though sometimes he leads through waters deep
Trials fall across the way
Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep
See his footprints all the way
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go
Soon He's coming back to us
Far beyond the starry sky
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown
I shall reign with Him on high
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go
Fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go
