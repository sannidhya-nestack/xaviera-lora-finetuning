In the eve of my own sorrow
Senseless chatter in my mind
And the pain I scraped and borrowed is all I find
Running wild in all directions
Feet planted in midair
On the brink of self destruction
No one cares
Picture my surprise
When I close my eyes
And I realized he was there
He picked up my restless heart and wiped away the tears
And mended my broken soul of hurt from all those years
Then whispered these precious words, a lullaby of love
Oh ya ya
As his strength began to enter
And our hearts became as one
His power hit dead center
He had won
And my desperation vanished, my sense of hope renewed
And the place where I felt banished became anew
Words cannot describe
What I felt inside
With him I survived
Here we go
He picked up my
Restless heart and wiped away the tears
And mended my broken soul of hurt from all those years
Then whispered these precious words, a lullaby of love
Oh ya ya
Oh ya ya
A life without tomorrow is so hopelessly insane
the freedom can't be borrowed from yesterday
And the loneliness so easy
If I choose to close the door
But I know that he is waiting for some more
Now I know today
As I go my way
That he's there to stay
Here we go
He picked up my restless heart and wiped away the tears
And mended my broken soul of hurt from all those years
Then whispered these precious words, a lullaby of love
Oh ya ya, oh ya ya
Oh ya ya, oh oh oh
Oh ya ya, you picked up my restless heart
Oh ya ya, mended my broken soul
He whispered these precious words, a lullaby of love
Oh ya ya, oh ya ya, oh ya ya, oh ya ya
Oh ya ya, oh ya ya, oh ya ya, oh ya ya
Ya ya ya ya oh ya ya
