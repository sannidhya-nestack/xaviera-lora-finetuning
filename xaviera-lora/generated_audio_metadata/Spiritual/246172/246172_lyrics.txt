Beneath the hollow journey, the meekness of a child does cry for you
In desperation longing to walk above the night and start anew
All huddled in the darkness crippled with the thought of emptiness
You carry me to Canaan and lift me with the hand of righteousness
Alleluia
Alleluia
We will rise and exalt the great I AM
And we'll dance in your streets, Jerusalem
As the angels sing glory to the Lamb
We will rise and exalt the great I Am
'Tis anger of the body that fights against the soul in agony
Foretold by those embodied that one shall come and break sin's tyranny
The love of the Creator walked among the souls of mortal men
To reunite the children around the throne of Him, the great I Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
We will rise and exalt the great I Am
And we'll dance in Your streets, Jerusalem
As the angels sing glory to the Lamb
We will arise and exalt the great I Am
We will rise and exalt the great I AM
And we'll dance in your streets, Jerusalem
Oh, as the angels, as they sing glory to the Lamb
We will rise and exalt the great I Am
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
