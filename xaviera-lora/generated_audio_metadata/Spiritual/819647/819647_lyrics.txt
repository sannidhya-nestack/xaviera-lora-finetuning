I followed you, I let you lead
You were so sure and I believed
You spoke of love, you touched my soul
You gave me hope, you made me whole
You lived
Your spirit's bright, I can go on
I'll be alright, you live in me
And now it's time to say goodbye
I don't know how, I don't know why
Is all hope gone? Is goodness dead?
What can I trust? Where should I head?
You live
Your spirit's bright, I can't go on
I'll be alright, you live in me
I close my eyes and see your light
Your spirit shines into the night
I feel your love, deep in my heart
It's not the end, it's just the start
You live in me, your spirit's bright
I can't go on, I'll be alright
You live in me
Your spirit's bright
I can't go on
I'll be alright
You live in me
