Where all releases so
Take to its time of birth
Came from one unto this earth
I take you back to when
Spirit flows without an end
Tides of time that see no separate lines
All is all, one is all
I was there
I just can't recall
Being part of all
Once I was the sun, beam of light where patterns run
You couldn't see my face or guess, I even had one
Once upon eternal time, we left that source behind and we live
But don't recall that time at all
All is all
One is nothing
I was there (I was there)
And I just can't recall being part of all
All is all, one is nothing (nothing though)
I was there (yeah, I was there, yeah)
I just can't recall
Being part of all is all (all is all it is)
One is nothing (nothing though)
I was there (I was there)
I just can't recall being part of all
