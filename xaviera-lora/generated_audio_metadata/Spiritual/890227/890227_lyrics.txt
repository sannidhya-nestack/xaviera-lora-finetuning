Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
That I should gain an interest in the Saviour's blood
Died He for me, who caused His pain
For me, who Him to death pursued
Amazing love, how can it be
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me
Amazing love, how can it be
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
He left His Father's throne above
So free, so infinite His grace
And till Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's health
For all my God hath found out me
Amazing love how can it be
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me
Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night
Line I diffused, a quickening ray
I woke the dungeon flame with light
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth and followed Thee
Amazing love, how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die
For me, no condemnation now I dread
Jesus and all in Him is mine
Alive in Him, my living Head
Clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown through Christ my own
Amazing love
How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me
Amazing love
How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me
