Every day I wanna love you
Show you all you mean to me
Every day I wake up early
With my eye on eternity
But every day I lose my focus
On the one thing I hold dear
Maybe you won't even notice
With so many children out there
But I know I'm kidding myself
you know me more than I know myself
Call me home
You know I don't wanna go this road alone
So come
Call me home
I know I don't deserve your mercy
Yet you always stay every day
Call me home every day
Every day I've got my prayer list
Hanging neatly on my wall
But I pass by in such a hurry
That I just don't see it at all
Every day the hope of changing
These old habits I endure
No escaping that I'm human
Till I am there with you, Lord
And I know I'm under attack
One step forward and two steps back
So call me home
You know I don't wanna go this road alone
So call me home
I know I don't deserve your mercy
Yet you always stay every day
Oh, call me home
You know I don't wanna go this road alone
So call me home
I know I don't deserve your mercy
Yet you always stay
Every day
You whisper in my ear
To call me home
