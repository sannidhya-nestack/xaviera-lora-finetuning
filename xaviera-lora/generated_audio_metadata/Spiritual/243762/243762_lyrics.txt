I stand and look into their eyes
And no, I can't make one heart hear
The whisper of your gentle voice
The constant murmur in my ear
Like the roar of a lion
Rumbles warning to the wild
Like the whisper of a parent
Tucking in a child
Sing to me, oh sing to me
Until I learn your song
A melody, a harmony
Teach me to sing along
Till hearts of stone are broken white
And I can lead them to your side
The sheep for whom the shepherd died
Won't you sing to me
Enlarge and flame and fill my heart
Teach me to love them like you do
And let your voice inside my soul
Ring out to lead the lost to you
Like the cry of battle trumpets bringing down the city walls
Like the whipperwind of sweet music as twilight falls
Sing to me, oh sing to me until I learn your song
A melody
Love is a harmony (harmony)
Teach me to sing along
hearts of stone are broken white
And I can lead them to your side
The sheep are home, the shepherd died
Won't you sing to me (sing to me)
Oh, sing to me (sing to me)
A melody, a harmony
Two hearts of stone are broken wide
And I can lead them to your side
The sheep for whom the shepherd died
Won't you sing, oh sing to me, sing to me
Sing to me, sing to me, sing to me (Sing to me, sing to me, sing to me)
