Just a simple girl of privilege, she loses her cell phone
The dirty laundry hits the internet as the cameras roll
But that's not news in my town
That's not news around my house
There's a politician whining
things don't go his way
For all of those that he owes
He's got hell to pay
But that's not news in my town
That's not news around my house
This morning my daughter sang
Jesus loves me, this I know
And said, Daddy, only you can make this broken toy go
I realize I'm the greatest teacher
That she will ever see
And I'm here to tell you
That's news for me
I'm here to tell you
That's God's news for me
There's a soon to be bride
She runs away and hides
The National Guard is put on alert
Cause she won't walk the aisle
But that's not news in my town
That's not news around my house
A teacher falls for a student
She spends some years in jail
She does her time then sells a book on talk shows everywhere
But that's not news in my town
That's not news around my house
This morning my daughter sang, "Jesus loves me, this I know"
And said, "Daddy, only you can make this broken toy go"
I know I am the greatest teacher that she will ever see
And I'm here to tell you that's news for me
I'm here to tell you that's God's news for me
She won't learn it on TV or from an old social refrain
long after that I'm gone my lessons with her will remain
I am the first roadmap that she will ever read
And I'm here to tell you that's news for me
I'm here to tell you that's God's news for me
'Cause I am the first roadmap that she will ever see
And I'm here to tell you that's news for me
I'm here to tell you that's God's news for me
