You say you've got to change
Got to rearrange all the things you're doing
These days you can feel the pain
And you can't hide the shame
Quite the way you used to
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
I know he will answer
He will always be there
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes he will answer
He will always be there
Now I know that you might be afraid
All you need is faith
He will have all the answers
When friends come and when friends go
Let the stories told about him happen every day
When the call comes (When the call comes)
When the call comes (When the call comes)
When the call comes
I know he will answer
He will always be there
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes
When the call comes he will answer
He will always be there
He will be there
He will be there
He will be there
