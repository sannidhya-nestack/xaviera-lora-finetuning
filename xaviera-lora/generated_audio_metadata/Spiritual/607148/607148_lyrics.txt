Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Even though it be a cross that raises me
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee
Or if on joyful wing clear
The sky, sun, moon and stars ot
Upward I fly
Still all my song shall be
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee
