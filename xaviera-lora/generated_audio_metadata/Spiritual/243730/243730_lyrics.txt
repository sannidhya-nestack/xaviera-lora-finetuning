I know you see the love in me, I know you see the fears
We both have tried and failed at this before
You found the corner of my heart where dreams had gone to die
I tended to the battle scars you wore
And when there was no more to say
Your gentle voice began to pray
Restore the years gone
Dry the tears gone
Give back the vision we're so frightened of
Restore lost days
Trade doubt for praise
And help us find forever in your love
Like Peter I know I am weak
The rooster crows for me
And I long for the certainty of youth
But you have loved me as I am and let me see your pain
And we have grappled in the light of truth
So now we kneel before the cross
Asking God to find what we have lost
Restore the years, God
Dry the tears, God
Give back the vision we're so frightened of
Restore lost days
Trade down for praise
And help us find forever in your love
The richest soil is full of death
Yet gives itself to see life start
May the love we plant today
Be rooted in your very heart
Restore the years gone
Dry the tears God
Give back the vision we're so frightened of
Restore lost days
Trade down for praise
And help us find forever in your love
Please help us find forever in your love
