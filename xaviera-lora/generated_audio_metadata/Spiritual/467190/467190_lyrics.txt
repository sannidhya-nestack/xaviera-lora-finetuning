There was a time once when I felt sure and strong
I knew all the answers but that didn't last so long
There I was, full of air, just trying to leave my mark
But then I
Through a curve I wandered around
And finally found
I was staggering in the dark
Tell me where should I go
Who can give me direction
How can I know the path is right
Torch to and fro my poor heart
Needs protection as I'm staggering around
There was a time once when I thought love was real and would last forever
But now that's not how I feel, there I was
Full of hope, my heart on my sleeve
Silly fool, naggy dope
I should have known, lovers a poem
To stomp on your heart and leave
Tell me, where should I go? Who can give me direction?
How can I know the path is right?
Stars to and fro, my poor heart needs protection
As I'm staggering around, I'm stumbling in the dark
Tell me, are you the one who can give me direction?
Can I be sure your path is right?
Is there a chance that you'll offer salvation as I'm staggering around
And stumbling around
Are you the one who can give me direction?
Can I be sure the path is right?
Is there a chance that you'll offer salvation as I'm staggering around
And stumbling in the dark?
