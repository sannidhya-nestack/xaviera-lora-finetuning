We want everyone to get your minds and your hearts together
And put them up on Jesus
If you want to make heaven your home
That's why we're singing this song called Heaven
I'll be glad when it's over
And the problems lifted off my shoulder
Jesus truly told us that it soon will be over
No more pains and sorrows, no more tears for tomorrow
Jesus is soon to come, are you ready?
I'm here to tell you my friend (So you can make it in)
We've got to make it to the end
We must live free from sin
We're gonna make it in
To heaven
Well
The place I want to be
Sitting up there with Jesus
To heaven
I want you to know
That you can go
If you let Christ
Come into your life
And take control
Yeah, yeah
One of these days
The trumpet is gonna blow
And those that love Christ
Won't have to stay in this world anymore
The dead in Christ are gonna rise again (they're gonna rise again)
And we which are alive will be caught up (it's gonna be in a moment)
It's gonna be in a moment
In a twinkling of an eye
When Christ shall appear
There'll be joy in the sky
And we're gonna sing (oh yes, we're gonna sing)
And we're gonna shout (we're gonna shout)
Yes, we are (yeah)
Nobody there (nobody there)
Will put us out (put us out)
We're gonna sing (Oh yes, we're gonna sing)
We're, we're gonna shout (We're gonna shout)
Yes, we will (Yeah)
Nobody there (Nobody there)
Whoever put us out (Whoever put us out)
Lord have mercy
I'm here to tell you, my friend
We've gotta make it (We've gotta make it)
To the end (To the end)
We must live free from sin
We're gonna make it in to heaven
Oh the place I wanna be (the place I want to be)
Yes I do
There'll be no more crying (heaven)
Yeah no more dying (the place I want to be)
But there'll be love, joy
Peace everywhere
Yes it will
Yeah I can remember Jesus
He said in his words
That he's going to prepare a place for us
