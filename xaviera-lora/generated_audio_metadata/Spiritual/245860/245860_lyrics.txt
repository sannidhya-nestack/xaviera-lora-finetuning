Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me save that thou art
Thou my first thought in the day or the night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light
Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true word
Thou ever with me and I with thee, Lord
Thou my great Father and I thy true Son
Thou in me dwelling and I with thee
Be thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my strong tower
Raise Thou me heavenward, great power of my power
Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise
Now mine inheritance, now and always
Thou and thou only, the first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure thou art
High King of heaven, thou heaven's bright sun
Grant me its joys after victory is won
Heart of mine, O heart, whatever before
Still be thou my vision, O ruler of all
Oh heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be thou my vision, oh ruler of all
