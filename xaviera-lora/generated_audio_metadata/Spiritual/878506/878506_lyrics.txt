I put my trust in you, my Jesus
you lift me up so high
And I found my strength in the bound of your words
And your healing touch makes my soul and spirit fly
Soul and spirit fly
You're the light that shines in me
You're the very breath I breathe
One that I will ever need is you
And you're the glory and the power
Every day and every hour
All that I will ever need is you, is you
You stole my heart
With a whispering grace
You gave me nuanced desires
You speak truth in love
With a power and strength
At the sound of your name
My soul and spirit fly
My soul and spirit fly
You're the light that shines in me
You're the very breath I breathe
All that I will ever need is you
You're the glory I will cry every day and every hour
All that I will ever need is you
All that I will ever need
All that I will ever need
Is you
All that I will ever need
All that I will ever need
Is you
It's you, it's you, it's you
You're the light that shines in me
You're the very breath I breathe
Hold it out and let it in
And you're the glory and the power
Every day and every hour
More than I will ever need is you
Is you
Is you
