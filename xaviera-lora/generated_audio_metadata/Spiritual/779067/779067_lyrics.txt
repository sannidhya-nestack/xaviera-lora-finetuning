King Herod told his soldiers
Go forth into the land
And kill each male child before
He becomes a man
King Herod, he deserves a place
Inside the hall of shame
But sometimes I think maybe we're the same
They're innocent as angels
Pure as snow white doves
Innocent as angels from above
If we're the land of the free
Can anyone tell me
If there is innocent as angels
Why can't they be?
I guess I dreamed how things should be
Instead of how they are
I guess I'd storm all of heaven
To save a single star
Have we become so jaded
Or are we just getting old?
Or maybe there's a part of us we've sold
They're innocent as angels
Pure as snow white does
Innocent as angels from above
If we're the land of the free
Can anyone tell me
If there is innocent as angels
Why can't there be (Innocent as angels)
Can anybody tell me why the greatest land on earth
Cannot defend the youngest ones just waiting for their birth
Can anybody tell me what
They did that was so wrong
That they will never get to hear their song
Innocent as angels, pure as snow-white doves
Innocent as angels from above
If we're the land of the free
Can anyone tell me if there is
