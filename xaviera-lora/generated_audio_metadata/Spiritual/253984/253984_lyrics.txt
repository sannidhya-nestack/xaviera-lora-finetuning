Lord, I know that you love me and always will care
But sometimes I just can't believe you're still there
The way that I treat you, it just isn't fair
I don't spend time with you at all
Lord, I know that you're with me wherever I go
And though I love to be with you, I don't let you know
That my joy and my happiness continue to grow
As I spend more time with you
Standing on a hill with the sun in my eyes
Looking up to see the stars in the sky
Living a lifetime with you by my side
Gives me a reason to smile
On your power to ive, I can always depend
You're my master, my daddy, my friend'til the end
You've lightened my burdens again and again
When I didn't deserve it at all
Standing on a hill with the sun in my eyes
Looking up to see the stars in the sky
Living a lifetime with you by my side
Gives me a reason to smile
When I don't know where to turn
When I need a helping hand
You're always there to pick me up
You're my rock when I'm in sinking sand
Now I know I need to learn to respond to your plea
To love you and serve you so faithfully
And let your light shine inside me so others can see
The change that you made in my life
Standing on a hill with the sun in my eyes
Looking up to see the stars in the sky
Living a life down with you by my side
Gives me a reason to smile
Standing on a hill with the sun in my eyes
Looking up to see the stars in the sky
Living a lifetime with you by my side
Gives me a reason to smile
Living a lifetime with you by my side
Oh lord, there's no one else
Who can give me the comfort you give
And you give me a reason to smile
