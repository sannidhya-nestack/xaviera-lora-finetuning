Out of the depths I cry to you
You are my Lord
You are my Lord
Please hear my cry for mercy
Hear my voice
Hear my voice
Won't you hear my voice
And I wait on the Lord
In his word I put my hope
My soul waits on the Lord
More than a watchman for the dawn
And I wait on the Lord
In his word I put my hope
My soul waits for you
If you, oh Lord, kept a record of sins
Who could stand, who could stand
But with you there is iveness
You are feared, you are feared
How we feel in the earth
And I wait on the Lord
In his word I put my hope
My soul waits on the Lord
More than a watchman for the dawn
And I wait on the Lord
In his word I put my hope
My soul waits for you at home
I will wait for you
All my soul will rest
Waves
