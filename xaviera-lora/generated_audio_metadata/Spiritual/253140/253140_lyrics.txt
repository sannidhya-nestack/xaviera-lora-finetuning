I rang to you, you rang to me
And here we meet, in your house of prayers
The lights are on, the fire burns
And the fragrance of your love is in the air
Draw close to me and me to you
Let us run toward the chambers of the king
I will rejoice, be glad in you
I will exalt your love that is better than life
My lord, my strength, my master
I came to serve you
My friend, my hope, my savior
I came to hear you
It is here where I receive kisses from heaven
In your house of prayer I hear your whispers of love
In this holy place I surrender all
Jesus, what you say is what I would do
My love, my prince, my bridegroom
I'm waiting for you
My song, my all, my righteousness
I came to praise you
I came to hear you
I came to praise you
