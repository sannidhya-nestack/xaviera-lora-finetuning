It's me, Lord
It's me, Lord
I'm knocking at the door
Let me in, Lord
It's me, Lord, I'm knockin' at the door
Hold my hand, Lord, hold my hand, Lord
Hold my hand, Lord, I'm knocking at the door
Hear my prayer, Lord
Hear my prayer
Hear my prayer, Lord
I'm knocking at the door
It's me, Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's me, Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
We've been made undue for tonight
But joy, joy, joy, joy
It's me, Lord, Lord, it's me, it's me, Lord, I'm knockin' at the door
Let me in Lord, is it me Lord? I'm knocking at the door
Hold my hand, Lord
Hold my hand, Lord, oh-oh-oh
Hold my hand, Lord, I'm knockin' at the door
Hear my prayer, Lord
Hear my prayer, Lord
Lord, it's me, Lord
I'm knocking at the door
It's me, Lord
I'm standing at the door
It's me Lord
I'm standing at the door
No more sickness
There'll be no more sickness
It's me
And you won't
You won't have to cry (It's me, oh Lord)
All you gotta do is have faith (It's me, oh Lord)
And believe in giving God a try (Oh Lord)
It's me (I wanna be like Joe) oh Lord (back in the Bible days) it's me (he held on to his faith) it's me (no matter) oh Lord (no matter what came his way) it's me
