You are my special love, inside my heart
I cherish you, a love so deep, so passionate and true
Your smile brightens up my day
But are you here?
Oh are you here to stay?
Where have you gone?
My skies have all turned to grey
Come back to me
And bring the sunlight back into my day
Where have you gone?
There's so much more we need to say
Come back to me when you run away
I reach out to touch you
I see you so clearly
This feels so real
Could it be just a fantasy?
I hear your whispers
And I know you're watching me
I feel you near, or is it just a dream? Where have you gone?
My skies have all turned to grey
Come back to me
And bring the sunlight back into my day
Where have you gone?
There's so much more we need to say
Come back to me
Or would you run away?
Take me with you wherever you are
I hear your whispers, I feel your presence
I wanna be with you, beside you everyday
Where have you?
My skies have all turned to grey
Come back to me and bring the sunlight back into my day
Where have you gone?
There's so much more we need to say
Come back to me or would you run away?
Where have you gone? My skies have all turned to grey
Come back to me and bring the sunlight back into my day
Where have you gone? There's so much more we need to say
Come back to me, or would you run away?
