Hey there God, it's me again, I will just sneak in
I found you long ago, why am I still seeking?
The quiet of my heart has turned to silent emptiness
And lack of pain has come to masquerade as happiness
My eyes are dry, I wander aimlessly
I see you in others' eyes, I can't find you in me
But when I'm falling down, you pick me up
When I'm burning out, you fill my cup
When I feel afraid, I know I'm safe within your arms
When I'm on my knees, you hear me
When I'm lost in pain, you heal me
When I feel afraid, I know I'm safe within your arms
Find your child, please seek your lamb
I'll wait, here I am
I'm trying to be good
But good enough is just a sham
Whisper to me that your promises are always true
Tell me again the things I was sure I already knew
I've preached your grace and I have run the race
But somehow lost the time I need to simply see your face
And when I'm falling down you'll pick me up
When I'm burning out you will fill my cup
When I feel afraid I know I'm safe within your arms
When I'm on my knees, you hear me
When I'm lost in pain, you heal me
When I feel afraid, I know I'm safe within your arms
When I'm lost in doubt, you hold me
You hold me when I'm feeling empty
You fill me when I'm on my knees
You hear me when I long to hear your voice
When I feel afraid I know I'm safe within your arms
