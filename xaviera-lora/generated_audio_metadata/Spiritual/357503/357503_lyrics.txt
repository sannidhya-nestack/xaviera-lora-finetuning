Here I stand clothed in blame
And I sing my old refrain
Come and heal me Lord
Steal away the pain
So like an ocean flood your grace
And though my soul cannot contain
Come and fill me Lord
Fill me once again
At the altar, ride me in the fold
Bathed in sunlight, amended by your blood
Lift my eyes, Lord, to look upon the cross
May I not et the sight
Of a savior's sacrifice and what your love has done
Here we are
Blood's been shed for every sin
But we're blinded, Lord
And scattered by the wind
Oh how we cry, oh how we pray
We can sing but not obey
Come and change us Lord
So we can bear your name
At the altar
Wrap us in a fold
Bathed in sunlight
Mended by your blood
Lift our eyes, Lord
To look upon the cross, may we not et the sight
Of a Savior's sacrifice, what Your love has done
Change me, won't you? Change me, you could
Change me, my precious sacrifice
Fill me, won't you? Fill me, you could
Fill me, my precious
Heal me, won't you heal me, you could
Heal me, my precious sacrifice
Save me, you can save me, you can
Save me, my precious sacrifice
