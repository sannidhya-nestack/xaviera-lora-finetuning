Na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
They're little warriors coming down from heaven
Armored in truth, hope and love
God sends his children down here to guide us
To help bring us back to him above
This is a song for all of the children
I believe they show us the way
They are the lights shining out of the darkness
Teaching us to live and be
Their little children born into affliction
Paying the price through no fault of their own
God sent them down to earth so they could teach us
And help us find our way back home
Yeah
This is a song for all of the children
I believe they show us the way
They are the lights shining out of the darkness
Teaching us to live in faith
Lord, can you tell us why they are the way they are? (Why they are)
And show us how to teach them to lead the way
Na na na na na, ha ha
They are the lights shining out of the darkness
Teaching us to live in faith
This is a song for all of the children
'Cause they are the lights
Shining out of the darkness
Teaching us to live in faith
I believe they show us the way (showing us the way)
They are the lights shining out of the darkness
Teaching us to live in faith
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
