Four thousand years ago a promise left away
A family bound to find a place where they would stay
And their faith was strong enough to bear the sacrifice
Would we be wise enough today to follow their advice?
We often stand in our own way
When all we need to do is bow and pray
Understanding all the risks that they would face
Receiving all their strength through love, unity and grace
Soon their life became a struggle to survive
They thought they had to live a life just to stay alive
But when the truth came out at last
The promised blessing surely came to pass
The family spread out to the corners of the earth
Loving, giving, living life for all that it's worth
The spirit found its way into each hungry heart
Giving us the key to make a brand new start
Faith is what we all believe yet cannot see
The promise kept through faith will surely set us free
So say a prayer for me and I'll say a prayer for you
And ask what our faith can do
They finally made their way across the desert sand
But once they settled in their troubles soon began
And though they made it safely to another land
Their own deception put an end to all their precious plans
But when the truth came out at last
The promised blessing surely came, surely came too fast
Surely came to pass
People blessed in every corner of the earth
Loving, giving, living life for all that it's worth
The spirit found its way into each hungry heart
Giving us the key to make a brand new start
Faith is what we all believe yet cannot see
The promise kept through faith surely shall be
Let us free, yeah
So say a prayer for me and I'll say a prayer for you
Imagine what our faith can do, yeah
We were blessed in every corner of the earth
Nothing ever lived in life but what was at its worth
Spirit found its way into each of our hearts
Giving us the key to make a brand new start
Faith is what we all believe in, can't it see?
The promise kept through faith is true and it surely holds the key
So say a prayer for me and I'll say a prayer for you
Imagine what our feet can do, oh yeah
Listen, say a prayer
Now say a prayer for God
And I'm praying for you
Say it, say it, say a prayer
