Don't up dreaming baby of yesterday
No more money worries no bills to pay
Don't go dreaming baby of younger years
No more worries baby just dry your tears I say come down
Get on your knees, I say come down
I'm begging you please, I say come down
Get on your knees, I say come down
Cleared of the substance, cleared of the same
Clitter religion, just praise for the change
Clitter the mystery of the mind
No more dreaming baby what thrills we'll find
I said come down
Get on your knees
I said come down
I'm begging you please, I say come down
Get on your knees, I say come down
Down, down, down
Come down, down, down
Come down, down, down
Get on your knees (take your time real slow)
Come down, down, down
Come down, down, down
Come down, down, down
Get on your knees (take your time real slow), come down
Get on your knees, I say calm down, I'm begging you please, I say calm down, get on your knees, I say calm down
I said come down (take it down real slow)
Get on your knees
I said come down (take it down real slow
I'm begging you please
I said come down (take it down real slow)
Get on your knees
Come down (take it down real slow)
Come down
