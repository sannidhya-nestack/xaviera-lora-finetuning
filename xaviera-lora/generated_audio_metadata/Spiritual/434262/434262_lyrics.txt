I was once like you, sitting back thinking
About my life and what it is I should do
So many questions running through my head left unanswered
Wanting some peace of mind in my life
Seek the truth from you
I've been wondering (I've been wondering)
Yes, I've been praying (I've been praying)
For the liars, the sinners, the takers, the drifters
Where do we all go?
Found my way out to Nashville, Tennessee
Where the people are kind and yeah
It's clean
My home is now the heartlands
I found strength in unity
I release my soul
Open your arms to me
I've been wandering (I've been wandering)
Yes, I've been praying (I've been praying)
For the liars, the sinners, the takers, the drifters
Where do we all go?
Isn't it about time we start living?
Isn't it about time we start iving?
Now isn't it about time we started feeling again?
I've been wondering (I've been wondering)
Yes, I've been praying (I've been praying)
For the liars, the sinners, the takers, the drifters
Where do we all go?
It's great to be at home
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
It's great to be home
Home again
Remove the shadows from my soul
Showed me your light
Send angels to this place
Let the spirit take flight
You believed in me
Yes you freed me
You ease this restless heart
Remove the shadows from my soul
Showed me your light
Send angels to this place
Let the spirit take flight
You believed in me
Yes, you freed me, you ease this restless heart
My restless heart
My restless heart removed the shadows from my soul
Showed me your light, sent angels to this place
Let the spirit take flight, you believed in me
Yes, you freed me, you ease this restless heart
Moved the shadows from my soul, showed me your light
Sent angels to this place, let the spirit take flight
You believed in me
Yes, you freed me, you ease this restless heart
My restless heart
