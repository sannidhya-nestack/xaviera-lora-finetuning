As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way
Oh sisters, let's go down
Let's go down, come on down
Oh sisters, let's go down, down to the river to pray
As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear the robe and crown, good Lord, show me the way
Oh brothers, let's go down, let's go down, come on down
Come on brothers, let's go down, down to the river to pray
As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear that starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way
Oh fathers, let's go down, let's go down
Come on down
Oh fathers, let's go down, down to the river to pray
As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear that robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way
Oh, mothers, let's go down, let's go down
Don't you wanna go down
Come on, mothers, let's go down
Down to the river to pray
As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear that starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way
Oh, sinners, let's go down
Let's go down, come on down
Oh, sinners, let's go down
Down to the river to pray
As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who should wear that robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way
