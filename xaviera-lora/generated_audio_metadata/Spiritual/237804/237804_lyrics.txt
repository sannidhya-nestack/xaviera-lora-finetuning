Ah yeah, SBK y'all, Jay Shaft and A .R. the songwriter
We about to praise God on this one
Pray with me, come on, come on, come on
Praise your name, God above
We sing hallelujah for your son
He gave his life
So that we might live
He paid the price for all our sins
So let the Holy Spirit move right now
As we magnify your name
Blessed right now
We open every heart and mind
Here right now
Praise your name
Jesus Christ
Let the Holy Spirit move right now
As we magnify your name
Bless right now
We open every heart and mind
Here right now
Praise your name
Jesus Christ
We give you glory, we are not alone
And when we're still way down, you are working it out
You hear our prayers and you supply
To footprints in the sand for a sinner like I
So let the Holy Spirit move right now
As we magnify your name
Blessed right now
We open every heart and mind
Here I praise your name
Jesus Christ
All who hear me, lift your hands and praise the Lord
All who hear me, lift your hands and praise the Lord
At the sound of my voice, lift your hands and praise the Lord
At the sound of my voice, lift your hands and praise the Lord
Like Meshach, Shadrach, Adam, Ben, and Go
Lift your hands and praise the Lord (lift them higher, lift them higher)
Like Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego
Lift your hands and praise the Lord
So let the Holy Spirit move right now
As we magnify your name
Bless right now
We open every heart and mind
Here right now
Raise your name
Jesus Christ
So let the Holy Spirit move right now
As we magnify your name, blessed right now
We open every heart and mind here right now
Praise the name Jesus Christ
Thanks for praying with me
