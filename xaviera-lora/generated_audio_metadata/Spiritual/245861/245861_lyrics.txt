I will give you adoration
I will draw from the wells of salvation
I will weep and I will dance for joy
I will cry out, I will listen
For your mercy's all new every morning
I will seek you in this quiet hour
For you are my strength and you are my song
You have become my salvation
You are my joy, my heart's only cry
With all that is in me, I lift you high
And I worship you
I worship you
I worship you
I worship you
I will rise up, I will fall down
I will worship the ruler of Zion
I will fear you, but I won't be afraid
I will shout out, I will whisper
I will come as a child to his father
I will find you in this holy place
For you are my strength and you are my song
You have become my salvation
You are my joy, my heart's only cry
With all that is in me I lift you high and I worship you
I worship you
I worship you, I worship you
I will give you adoration
I will draw from the wells of salvation
I will leap and I will dance for joy
I will cry out, I will listen
For your mercies are new every morning
I will seek you in this quiet hour
I will rise up and you will fall down
I will worship the ruler's hand
I will fear you but I won't be afraid
I will shout and I will whisper
I will come as a child to his future
I will find you in this holy place
I worship you
