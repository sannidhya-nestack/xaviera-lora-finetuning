God said to Moses, lead my people to the promised land
And Moses said alright Lord I'll do the best I can
But Moses lost his way in that desert terrain
Instead of starting to pray the people started to complain
They said you're looking for something that ain't there
Looking for something that can't be found
Forty years and we're nowhere and we're tired of walking around
Abraham and Sarah both wanted to have a son
But Abe was getting kinda old and Sarah was approaching ninety-one
Well Sarah made advances on old Abraham one night
Abe sat up in bed and turned on the bedroom light
He said, "You're looking for something that ain't there
You're looking for something that you ain't gonna find
If you're looking for love in this gray hair
Then you must be out of your mind"
Well Columbus found America but you know he almost failed
His trip was plagued with troubles from the day he sailed
His food supply was low and after fifty days at sea
The men on the Nina and the Pinta and the Santa Maria were talking a mutiny
They said you're looking for something that ain't there
Looking for something that can't be found
It might be flat and it might be square but the world can't be round
Now Samson loved Delilah in the land of the Philistines
But Samson didn't know that woman had an evil scheme
Then one day when he woke up he was tied to a chair
And when he tried to free himself he soon became aware
That he was looking for something that ain't there
Looking for something that couldn't be found
His strength lay in his long hair and that lay on the ground
Now Columbus found America and Abraham had his son
Moses found the promised land and Samson tore the temple down
So let this be a lesson to you people everywhere
If you're feeling down and out don't give up in despair
Just keep on looking for something that ain't there
Looking for something that can't be found and maybe someday
Somewhere your luck will turn around
Just keep on looking for something that ain't there
Looking for something that can't be found
And maybe someday, somewhere your luck will turn around
Looking for something
Looking for something, yeah
Looking for something
Oh looking for something
Looking for something
Looking for something
