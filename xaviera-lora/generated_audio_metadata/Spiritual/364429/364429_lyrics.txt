Good Lord, good Lord, ain't one good
I met a man at the wishing well down in Tennessee
He was blind but I could find by the wisdom in his mind
Boy he could surely see
He said there's a story teller that lives in everyone
But he's not one good
He's blind in the eyes of humankind
We all gotta wash our hands in the blood
Said he's blind in the eyes of humankind
Wash your hands in the blood
He's blind to the eyes of humankind
Wash your hands in the blood
And everybody's got a story to tell
But it ain't one good
I met this man at the wishing well
He said find one good
Try to find one good
Oh, I talked to a lady at a restaurant
I said, "Ma'am, isn't it a lovely day?"
She said my only son's on drugs
Last week I got mugged
And my husband just passed away
She said I'm not gonna worry
And I won't shed a tear
we're all in the passing
Only one breath for everlasting life
Son, don't you fear
One day you'll have a story to tell
Try to find one good
Everybody's got a story
But it ain't one good
Ain't one good love
Help me find one good
When I tell my story, Lord, let it be one good
Then I went back to the wishing well
Way down in Tennessee
And I knew in my mind I was running out of time
The story teller was calling me
It ain't one good story, Lord
Lord, you know it ain't love
I reached down inside and, Lord, you know I tried to find one good, good, only one good
I reached down the side of the lawn to know I'd try to find one good (one good)
Now I've got one good lawn (one good lawn)
To let me find one good (one good)
I met a man, I met a man after wishing well, he said (one good)
Just one good (good)
Lord, I find, I find, I find, I find anyone good, good, Lord, good, Lord
And you want a good, good Lord
Good Lord
And you want
