When we pray, let us all say, "Our Father"
Our Father, fill me up
Let not your heart be troubled, have patience
And you'll see Jesus working in your life
Don't be ashamed to call his name Jesus
He knows you care and he will work it out
Our father build me up
Our father dress me up
Our father clean me up
I'm your child, Lord
Let me take off these old rags
I'm your child, Lord
You make me feel so glad
I'm your child, Lord
You put a new bounce in me
I'm your child, Lord
I want the world to know I'm free
Oh, Father, Father
You build me up, oh, Father
Our Father, trust me
Oh, what can you do for me
Our Father, clean me up
Lord, this is my prayer
I'm calling on you
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
Look what you've done for me
Another soul has been saved and set free
I don't care what it is
Won't God work it out
Won't God work it out
He took away the old
So I can be born again
You clean me up Jesus
I am another soldier
I'm fighting on the promised land
Here I am Lord
You can use me
Use me any way you can, oh Lord
Our Father, build me up
Our Father, dress me up
Our Father clean me up
No matter how you use me
Our Father build me up
No matter how you use me
Our Father
As long as you clean me up, I lay awake at night, wondering if everything is alright, father use me
Lord, you be as you please
No matter what you do
No matter what you're going through
Lord, clean me up
No matter, no matter, no matter
Lord, clean me up
No matter what you do
No matter what you do
No matter what you do, clean me up
Lord, clean me up
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
