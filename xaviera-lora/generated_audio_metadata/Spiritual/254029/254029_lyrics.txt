Woken by a dream in the middle of the night
Grasping for air, searching for light
Wiping my face, the sting of the night rose into my eyes
I grab my chest, feel the beating of my heart
Oh, there's an emptiness there like I've never felt before
As if a thief had come into the night
And pulled upon my sacred door
Oh, save me, save me
Save me from this cold and darkened night
Save me, save me, pull me to the morning light
Can't imagine what I've done wrong to suffer this fate
It doesn't belong to me, can't someone come and take it away
Who says that I have to bear all, to bear all that I can't change
I give to those in need when I can
I reach out to any that I feel deserve a chance
Is that so wrong
Or is this all just circumstance
Save me
Save me
Save me from this cold and darkened night
Save me
Save me
Save me, pull me to the morning light
How desperate we are to find our way
Listening to words that so many people say
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Won't someone come and open up the door?
Who'll save me?
Save me, save me from this cold and darkened night
Save me, save me, pull me to the morning light
I listen to those of age, wait for just so long
And then I turn away, I've got so many other things going on
I've only got so much time to fill
Just like you, just like you
Should I've given more, should I've taken less
Is it now my time, who decides the rest
I thought I was doing all that I could
Didn't you, didn't you, oh
Save me, save me
Save me from this cold and darkened night
Save me, save me
Save me, pull me to the morning light
How desperate we are to find our way
Listening to so many things so many others say
Where can we go
Where can we go
Oh won't someone come and open up my door
Oh save me
Save me
Save me from this cold and darkened night
Save me
Save me
Pull me to the morning light, oh
Save me, save me
Help me, I need your help tonight
Save me, oh save me
Pull me up to the morning light
Oh now save me, save me
Hold me, hold me close, hold me tight
Save me, save me
Oh don't let me fall into the darkness of the night
Save me
Oh, now save me
Hold me, oh, hold me tight
Oh, now save me
Oh, now save me
Oh, now hold me up to my morning light
Oh, now, now save me
Save me
Hold me, hold me tight
Oh, now save me
Save me
Oh, don't leave me alone tonight
Mmm, tonight
Mmm, tonight
