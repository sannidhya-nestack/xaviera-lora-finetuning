I need living water
Pure flowing cleansing stream
Pure fire at your altar
Wash me Lord and I'll be clean
Let joy burst forth from my soul
Oh what freedom God can bring
To a heart that's thirsty for Him
When He fills me up I've got to sing
Holy, holy is the Lord
Worthy, worthy is the Lord
You satisfy the weary, Lord
Oh, and fountain overfill
Your river of refreshing
Renews my heart and my soul
Jesus, you bring fullness
To every part of me
You are the fulfillment
And your atonement sets me free
Holy, holiest Lord
Worthy, worthy is the Lord
If anyone thirsts, if anyone thirsts
Come and drink the waters of life
If anyone thirsts, if anyone thirsts
Come and drink the waters of life
If anyone thirsts, if anyone thirsts
Come and drink the waters of life
If anyone thirsts, if anyone thirsts
Come and drink the waters of life
Run, run in the water
Run, run in the water
I need living water
Pure flowing cleansing stream
Purified at your altar
Wash me Lord and I'll be clean
Let joy burst forth from my soul
Oh what freedom God can bring
To a heart that's thirsty for Him
When He fills me up I've got to sing
Holy, holiest Lord
Worthy, worthy is the Lord
Holy, holy is the Lord
Worthy, oh worthy
