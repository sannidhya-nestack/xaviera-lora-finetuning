The world has turned your heart so hard
you've otten who you are
You know you were meant to be more like
The one who saved us all from sin
We need to be more like him
More like him
More like him
Wanna be more like him
More like him
More like Him, can't we be more like Him?
More like Him, can't we be more like him?
With faith and patience we'll succeed
To do away with all the greed
Time will tell
Just how well we'll feed the need
More like him
More like him
Wanna be more like him
More like him
More like him
Can't we be more like him
More like him
Can't we be more like him
