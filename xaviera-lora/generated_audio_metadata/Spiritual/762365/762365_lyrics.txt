I lift up my hands, my eyes to the hills
This sacrifice is all I can give
Help in distress, in you I rest
My heart knows no rest
To hear your voice
I come to worship
I come to worship
I lift up my hands
My eyes to the hills
This sacrifice
Help comes from you, you know what to do
Take my hand and lead me through
I come to worship
I come to
I lift up my hands, my eyes to the hills This sacrifice is all I can give
I lift up my hands, my eyes to the hills This sacrifice is all I can give
I come to worship
I come to worship
I come to worship
I come to worship
