Here I am, clothed in these filthy rags again
There you are
You are so beautiful
Oh father
Where were you when I fell down
You were right there
Spirit
Where will you be when I fall again?
You'll be right there, Jesus
Where were you when I fell short?
You were right there to take my place
This one thing I know
I once was blind but now I see
This one thing I'd do
I'd press on to the call
The call is here
Here I am
Oh father
Where were you when I fell down
You were right there
Spirit, where will you be when I fall again?
You'll be right there, Jesus, where were you when I fell short?
You were right there to take my place
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am, here I am, here I am
