Take my hands, let them reach
Through the thorns
Serving those in need
Take my feet
Let them move
I'm distracted
Constantly with you
And all I am is all I can be
And all I can be is devoted
All I am is all I can be
And all I can be is devoted
Take my lip
Or let them speak
To the world of what you've done in me
All I am is all I can be
And all I can be is devoted
All I am is all I can be
And all I can be is devoted
God, you've promised me so many things
All my needs and all my dreams
You're an unseen friend in the busy crowd
My heart pours out and I hit the floor without a single word
When I survey all that I don't deserve
I must confess that I feel this way or all rocks and trees will sing your praise
And so I lose my way and I drop your will
And I curse your name and yet you are still
Loving me, loving me
I can't understand why you're loving me
Don't let me run away
Don't let me run away
Don't let me run away
Don't let me run away
Take my life and let it be
Always only for thee
Always
Always, always, always, always, always, always, always
Finally
