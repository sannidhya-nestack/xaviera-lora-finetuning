You are the light that shines onto every dark road
You are the true love that we all are searching for
You're the love that completes every human being
No matter if we don't know it yet
And even when we can't see it, we need you
You are the light that shines onto every dark road
You are the true life that we all are searching for
You're the love that completes every human being
No matter if we don't know it yet
And even when we can't see it
We need you, we need you
Oh God, how I need you
Every human in the human race needs you
To intervene in the lives, Lord
So intervene in the lives, Lord
From the wife that's in love
From the husband that's been cheated
From every child going hungry
Without any parenting, Lord
Your heart cries out
I want to be used by you
I wanna be used by you
Show me your heartbeat
You love everyone, no one is left out
And no one is better than anyone else
Your heartbeat is for everyone here
No matter what color or what age
I ive the Lord, because you have loved me first
And you have iven me many times
When I didn't deserve it
Who are we to judge?
I'm sitting on iveness
You must ive
You can ive with the love of Christ
Cause he has iven you through the cross
Just believe
Teach me more of your ways
Oh, I delight in knowing the truth
Especially from you
Speak to me once again
Speak to me every day
'Cause I long to hear your voice
Your spirit's leading
There's nothing like it, God
You are the light that shines up to every dark road
And you are the true life that we all are searching for
You are the love
That completes every single human being
No matter where we don't know it yet
And even if we can't see it, we need you
We need you, we need you
We need you, we need you, we need you
Help us to know we need you, we need you
Show us we need you, let us come
With humble hearts
Say we need you
We need you
We need you
We need you
