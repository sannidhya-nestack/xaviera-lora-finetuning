You can do everything you can imagine
There's a world outside of your door
You can be anything that you've been dreaming
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You can't do everything you can imagine
There's a world outside of your door
You can't be anything that you've been dreaming
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
Pick yourself up and the world is yours
So this is the life that we're living and it always seems like we're never good enough
So let's just et all the troubles and remind ourselves exactly who we are
Cause it's you that lives forever
In our hearts, anything that makes a difference in our lives
This is the life that we're given
