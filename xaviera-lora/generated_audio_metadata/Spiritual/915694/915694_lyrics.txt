Gathering clouds, scattered light in the leaves
Is it the scent of that wind that keeps calling me home
Now when branches are bare
I recall each breath as a prayer
Ordinary, extraordinary
It's the beauty I remember
Quiet, sitting there still
Familiar grace, I will drink in my fill
Choir of birds song is calling me
Sunlit and darkening
Twilight and beckoning calling
Me home, ooh
Calling me home
Ooh, now when branches are bare
I recall each breath as a prayer
Ordinary, extraordinary
It's the beauty I remember
Quiet, sitting there still
Familiar grace, I will drink in my fill
Choir of birds song is calling me
Sunlit and darkening
Twilight and beckoning
Calling me home, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Day, day, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Twilight and beckoning
Calling me
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
