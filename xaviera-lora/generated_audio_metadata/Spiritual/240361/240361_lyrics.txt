The sun is on the sidewalk, sidewalk
Shining through the whole block, where I walk
I can see the sunlight, sunlight
Burning in the dead of night, out of sight
I can see the sunlight here
I've gotta show that I know it's real now
I've got something within me
I've gotta blow that I can't conceal now
you put something within me
Listen to the sound, to the sound
While it's moving all around
Falling to the ground
I can hear you calling me, calling me
Breaking down the wall for me
Set me free
I can feel the sunlight here
I've gotta show that I know it's real now
I've got something within me
I've gotta glow that I can't conceal now
you've got something within me
Rise up, light the fire
I've got a glow that I can't conceal now
Jump in the flow, light the world
We gotta fan the flames, burn it out now
Jump in the flow, pick up the glow
We gotta fan the flames, burn it out now
Jump in the flow, pick up the glow
We gotta fan the flames, burn it out now
Flames burning out
I've got a show that I know it's real now
I've got something within me
I've got a glow that I can't conceal now
you put something within me
I've got a show that I know it's real now
I've got something within me
I've got a glow that I can't conceal now
you put something within me
Something within me
