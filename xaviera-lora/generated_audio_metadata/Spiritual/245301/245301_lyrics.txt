I'm running from the life I used to live, yeah
I'm running to the way, the truth, the life
I'm leaving all that I have become
I'm running
I'm listening
Echoes of your love surround me
Daily
Move beyond the borders of my comfort
Trust in your unfailing love, daily
And I
Wanna understand your word
I wanna tell you've not yet heard
About the sound of man, Jesus
Amazing
You died for me upon that cross
Amazing
You suffered, whipped and beaten, you stood
So silent, legions waiting for your call but
Silent
And I wanna try to understand
Why I rejected you, you loved me
The same as you do today, amazing
Oh, I tried
To understand your love
Why
Rejected you, you love
Me
The same as you do today
Amazing
