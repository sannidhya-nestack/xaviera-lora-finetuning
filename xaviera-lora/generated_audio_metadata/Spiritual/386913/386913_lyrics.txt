God has given us everything we need for life
Even though we don't deserve it
His love just keeps on shining through
Through to me and you
His love just keeps on flowing across
He has given his love (given his love)
Given himself (given himself)
No greater love
Never end this
He is the one who has changed my life
He died on the cross and he paid my price
Oh...
Each day I feel him, his word a lamp unto my feet
Tells me what to do, shows me where to go
He's all over me, and he's keeping me alive
So I'll just keep on praising him
Given in love (given in love)
Given himself (given himself)
No greater love had a man than this
He is the one who has changed my life
He died on the cross and he paid my price
There was no reason for him to love me
But he did anyway
He gave me a piece
Knowing that I'll see him, see him someday
Someday
He has given his love (given his love)
Given himself (given himself)
No greater love had a man than this
He is the one who was
Of my life
He died on the cross and he paid my price
He is the one who has changed my life
He died on the cross and he paid my price
Ooh, ooh, ooh
