I gotta tell you that the road that you're headed on is empty
I wanna help you if you're running in circles, world is spinning
Going nowhere without a sign
It's time to leave it all behind
And turn it all around
Lay your burdens down, the weight will bury you
Turn it all around
Let love carry you to higher ground
You've grown accustomed to living in darkness, now you're dying
Breathing's not easy and the peace that you're seeking is nowhere to be found
But now you're drowning with no side to land
Please don't let this be your last chance to turn it all around
Lay your burdens down
The weight will bury you, bury you
Turn it all around
Let God carry you to higher ground
Some place over the rainbow
And somewhere beyond your sorrow
There is hope for tomorrow, yeah
If you turn it on
If you turn it around
Around, around, around, around
Turn it all around
Lay your burdens down
The weight will bury you
Turn it all
Let love carry you to higher ground
Let God carry you to higher ground
