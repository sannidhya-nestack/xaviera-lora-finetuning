Jesus, let me talk to you
Do you need to talk? (Tell me what)
All you gotta do (I'm going through)
Is get down on your knees and pray
I just need a sign from you
When you just need one sign
Telling me, telling you
Everything is cool, everything will be alright
Lord I need you to help me work this out
Cause sometimes I don't know what this is all about
I don't wanna live in fear and doubt
Let me talk to you Jesus, hear me out
Lately I've been going through some ups and downs
Trials and tribulations are what I've found
Best thing to do is trust in you
Cause I live all because of you
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you
Jesus, let me talk to you
Let me talk to you
Tell me what I'm going through
I'm going through
I just need a sign from you (I just need a sign from you)
Just tell me (It was so long)
Everything is cool, it'll be alright
I'm telling you nobody's gonna be there for me like you (no)
Nobody's gonna ever love me like you (no)
We'll be by my side (my side)
New day and night (my night)
Can't make it right
Nobody who will lend that love in your ear
And when they say they'll be there you know they'll be right there (right there)
And that's you and only you so what else is what I do?
But call Jesus (Jesus)
Let me talk to you
Yes Lord (Tell me what)
Tell me what (I'm going through)
I'm going through
I just need a sign from you (I just know)
Telling me everything is good (everything is good)
It'll be alright
I know we go through it but Christ went through it even worse
So when we look at that we gotta say it'll be alright
And all you gotta do is get down on your knees and pray to him
So you'll be alright
Let him know what you're going through
It'll be alright
I know it will, yes it will, yes it will, eh-eh-eh-eh (It'll be alright, Jesus)
Oh-oh-oh (Let me talk to you)
Let me talk to you (Tell me what)
I'm going (I'm going through)
I'm going through (I just)
I just need a sign from you, a sign from you to tell me
Everything is cool, it will be alright
