There's a train that's bound for glory
And it's halfway down the line
And the conductor's yelling all aboard
To the people he can't find
Some too busy with this world
Some still think there's time
But that train, it waits for no one
And it's halfway down the line
There's a glory train a-boardin'
And it always leaves on time
It stops its stations one by one
Movin' on down the line
You know it may not come this way again
Oh people don't be left behind
that train is bound for glory
And it always leaves on time
Glory train
Won't you wait for me
I'm getting ready for that glory train
Gonna set my burden free
Glory train
Coming down that line
Won't you carry me to salvation
When it comes my time to ride
There's a train that's still a-boardin'
For every woman, man and child (man and child)
People better come a-runnin'
Salvation's gettin' hard to find (hard to find)
Some still busy with this world
Some just pray there's time
But this glory train's a-boardin'
For every woman, man and child
Glory train
Won't you wait for me
I'm getting ready for that glory train
Gonna set my burden free
Glory train
Coming down that line
Won't you carry me to salvation
When it comes my time to rise
Glory train
Won't you wait for me
I'm getting ready for that glory train
Gonna set my burden free
Glory train
Coming down that line
Won't you carry me to salvation
When it comes my time to ride
Won't you carry me to salvation
When it comes my time to ride
