I've got a hotline to the Lord
And he lets me call collect
Every time I have a problem
I just dial the Lord direct
I never get a busy signal
If my message is sincere
I just pick up that receiver
And start out with a prayer
I've got a hotline to the Lord
And you can have one too
He's reserved a special number
And He's holding it for you
It's a universal service
Everybody can afford
You can have a hotline, a hotline to the Lord
I've got a hotline to the Lord
I can call him anytime
I don't worry'bout the phone bill
I don't have to spend a dime
I got the toll free number
Memorized in my mind
I just close my eyes and say a prayer
And get Jesus on the line
I've got a heart of lime to the Lord
And you can have one too
He's reserved a special number
And He's holding it for you
It's a universal service
Everybody can afford
You can have a heart of lime
A heart of lime to the Lord
I've got a hotline to the Lord
And He always takes my call
Anytime I'm down and hurting
With my back against the wall
He listens to my story
And He helps me see the light
His line of communication
Is open day and night
I've got a hotline to the Lord and you can have one too
He's reserved a special number and he's holding it for you
It's a universal service everybody can afford
You can have a hotline
A hotline to the Lord
You can have a hotline, a hotline, a hotline to the Lord
