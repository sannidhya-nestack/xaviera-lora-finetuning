Jesus, what a friend of sinners
Jesus, lover of my soul
Friends may fail me, foes assail me
He, my Savior, makes me whole
Hallelujah
What a Savior, hallelujah, what a friend
Saving, helping, keeping, loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus, what a strength in weakness
Left behind myself in Him
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing
He my strength, my victory wins
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah, what a friend
Saving, helping, keeping, loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus, what a help in sorrow
While the billows over me roll
Even when my heart is breaking
He, my Comforter, helps my soul
Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah
What a friend
Saving, helping, keeping, loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus, what a guide and keeper
While the tempest still is high
Storms about me, night o'er takes me
He my pilot, He who's my bride
Hallelujah
What a Savior, hallelujah, what a friend
Saving, helping, keeping, loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus, I do now receive Him
More than all in Him I find
He has granted me iveness
I am His and He is mine
Hallelujah, what a Savior! Hallelujah, what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving He is with me to the end
