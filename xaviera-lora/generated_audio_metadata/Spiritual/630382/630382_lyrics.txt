How peaceful to rest in the arms of the Savior
How peaceful to trust in the Lord
To know as believers we have His assurance
That one day we'll see our reward
Together we'll be with the Lord
We'll join with the angels in heaven And sing the glad songs evermore
We'll sit with the king and we'll join with the saints
Forever our God we'll adore
How peaceful to rest in the arms of the Savior
How peaceful to trust in the Lord
To know as believers we have His assurance
That one day we'll see our reward
Together we'll be with the Lord
Until that sweet time when we see Him
Our troubles and sickness are sure
But God will not put on us more than are due
He knows how much we can endure
How peaceful to rest in the arms of the Savior How peaceful to trust in the Lord
To know as believers we know His assurance
And one day we'll see our reward
Together we'll be with the Lord
