Can you feel the gentle breeze? Can you feel the grace upon you every morning anew? Can you see what He prepared for you already? Can you smell His love upon your life?
Well, I have to thank the Lord today for my life
Can you feel the gentle breeze?
Can you feel the grace upon you every morning anew?
Can you see what He prepared for you already?
Can you smell His love upon your life?
Well, I have to thank the Lord today
For my life
Hey, hey, so clap when you're lucky
Stomp your foot today
Look to the right and dance to the left
Get ready for your wave
Clap when you're lucky
Look to the right and dance to the left, get ready for your way
Can you feel the gentle breeze?
Can you feel His mercy falling all over you?
Can you hear the choir voices sing for you
Can you smell his love upon your life
Well I have to thank the Lord today for my life, for my life
Stomp your foot today
Look to the right and dance to the left
Get ready for your way
Clap when you're lucky
Stomp your foot today
Look to the right and dance to the left
Get ready for your way
Can you feel the gentle breeze?
