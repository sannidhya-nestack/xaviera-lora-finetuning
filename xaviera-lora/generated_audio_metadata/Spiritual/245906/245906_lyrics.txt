Ooh, yeah
In the middle of trouble you've never faced
When you're walking through sadness I'll give you my grace
When you're drying those tears and no one cares
Call my name I will always be there
Like a river that flows from up above
I will give you my gift of love
To guide you through every storm
Hold my hand I, I will lead you home
I'm beginning and the end
First and the last
Gave my love to you
I will never take it back
The same every day
Always be true
When you put your trust in me
I make everything new
I will give you my gift of love to guide you through every storm
Hold my hand, I will lead you home
Everything impossible that you cannot see
Don't give up, don't throw it all away
I promise you'll find it out, hey me
Oh, I promise
I give you my word
Oh, I promise
Oh, yeah
Like a river that flows
Oh, yeah
I will give you love (I will give you love)
Keep the love (keep the love)
To guide you through (to guide you through)
Every storm (every storm)
Hold my hand now
I will lead you home
Like a river that flows (like a river that flows)
From up above (from up above)
I will give you love (I will give you love)
Gift of love (love, love, love)
To God, to the world (God, to the world)
Every star (every star)
