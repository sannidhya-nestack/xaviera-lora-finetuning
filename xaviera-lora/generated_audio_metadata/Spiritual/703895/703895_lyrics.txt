Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee
Even though it be a cross that raiseth me
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
Oh, like the wanderer, the sun gone down
Darkness be over me, my hair as a stone
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
There lets the way appear
Steps up to heaven
All that thou sendest me
In mercy given
Angels do beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee
