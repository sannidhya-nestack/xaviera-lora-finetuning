Rise to greet the morning
God's new day is dawning
Rise and glory's light today
No more pain and sorrow
Only bright tomorrows
Rise, salvation's here to stay
Oh Lord, you bring a brand new day
Painted in colors of your love
I will embrace the brand new day
Given with mercy from above
Oh, brand new day
Rise to greet the morning
God's new day is dawning
Rise and glory's light today, oh
Jesus' pain and sorrow
Brings a new tomorrow
Rise, salvation's here to stay
Oh Lord, you bring a brand new day
Painted in colors of your love, oh oh
I will embrace the brand new day
Given with mercy from above, oh oh
Brand new day
Brand new day, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Brand new day, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Brand new day, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Brand new day
