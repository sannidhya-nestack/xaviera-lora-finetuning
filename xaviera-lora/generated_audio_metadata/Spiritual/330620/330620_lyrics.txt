Before you were a smile on your mother's face
You were daily prayer from faithful lips
Before you were a sign of God's amazing grace
We surrendered our ways to His
And baby, baby, baby, baby boy
Welcome to this world my pride and joy
Someday soon you too will have a voice
Welcome to this world baby boy
Now I watch you grow into a little man
Like an angel learning to fly
So innocent inside
As we watch you reach out to understand
All the questions to the meaning of life
And baby, baby, baby, baby boy
Growing up in this world so full of joy
Some day soon you too will have a choice
To bring into this world another voice
Now you're grown with one of your own
One more branch on the tree
When He calls you dead
Give thanks and be glad
And add one more to God's family
Baby, baby, baby, baby boy
Forever you will be my pride and joy
Another day to love and rejoice
Bring into this world baby boy
And baby, baby, baby, baby boy
Forever you will be my pride and joy
Another day to love and rejoice
For bringing to this life baby boy
