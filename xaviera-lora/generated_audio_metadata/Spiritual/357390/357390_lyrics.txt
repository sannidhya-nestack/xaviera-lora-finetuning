A face lost inside a crowd
A voice
A voice laughing out loud inside a crowd
And feel the pain on your own
As you float inside a world where you feel all alone
Shattered glass and stolen dreams
Live entire lives away from everything
And feel the air
Whip across her face, dancing through her hair
I never will et the crying child in my head
Feel the sting, smell the blood
Fighting for a man who cannot seem to love
Hide away your last regret
And crush the memories that you cannot et
And feel the end
Across her face, dancing through her hair
Oh, I never will et the crying child, yeah
And the world is breaking down
Just a child all alone
And just a life we're taking down
And run away and try to change
Just try to change
Try to change
Try to change
Badabum
But I'm bored, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I'll fall
But I'll fall
But I'll fall
But I'll fall
But I'll crawl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
