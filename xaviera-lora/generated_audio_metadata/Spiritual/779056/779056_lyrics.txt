I used to wish I had that one's face
And this one's grace
And that one's wisdom
What I wouldn't give for that one's gift
How I wished for that one's vision
I used to wish I had so many things
Then I came to see
All I have is all I need
And all I am is all I have to be
I don't want more
All that I had is all I need
All that I had is all I need
I used to wish I had that one look
How I love that one's money
What I wouldn't give for that one's car
It sounds bizarre but now it's funny
The sun could never settle all I needed
Till it dawned on me
All I had
It's all I need (All I need) and all I am is all I have to be
I don't want more
Than what my creator gave to me
All I have is all I need
I can wander this world from hill to sea
But our roads lead back to me
The sun could never set on all I needed
it dawned on me
All I have is all I need (is all I need)
And all I am is all I need
Have to be
I don't want more
Than what my creator gave to me
All I have
Is all I need
All I have
Is all I need
Ooh
