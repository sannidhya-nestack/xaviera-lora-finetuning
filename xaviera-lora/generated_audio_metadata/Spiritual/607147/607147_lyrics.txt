Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus
Loves me, oh yes, Jesus
Loves me for the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me, he who died
Heaven's gate to open wide
He will wash away my sins
Let his little child come in, yes
Jesus loves me, oh yes, Jesus loves me, oh yes
Jesus loves me for the bible tells me so
Jesus loves me
He will stay close beside me all the way
Thou has bled and died for me
I will henceforth live for thee
Yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
