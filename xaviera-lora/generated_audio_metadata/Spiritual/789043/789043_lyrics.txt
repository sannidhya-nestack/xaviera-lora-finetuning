There are times when my well is dry
And I just can't find any reason to continue
It is then in my hour of need
That you intercede
And I turn my heart to you, whoa
I turn to you for the string
To help me rise above this jaded world
I always turn to you, turn to you
Turn to You, Lord, I'll always turn to You
From your path Lord I know I have fallen time and again
But somehow you always take me back
With your love I will find my way
Cause I know your grace is the only thing I lack
So I turn to you for the wisdom
To get me through this life
And that is why I always turn to you
Turn to you, turn to you
Lord, I always turn to you
I hope that I will not et
My eternal damner
Well, well, and I pray that I don't lose sight
Through my longest night that heaven is my only goal
I turn to you when I feel like I don't have one friend
Yes, that is when I always turn to You
Turn to You, turn to You
Lord, I'll always turn to You
Turn to You, turn to You
Lord, I'll always turn to You
Turn to You
Lord, I always turn to you
