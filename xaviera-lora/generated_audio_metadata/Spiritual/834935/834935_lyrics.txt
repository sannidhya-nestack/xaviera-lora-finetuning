People all over town
Talking about life, getting them down
But do they appreciate the simple things?
Got to get away from the feeling
Of all the violence and hate that we're dealing
And look at the world through the eyes of someone else
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a brand new day (It'll be a brand new day)
It'll be a new day rising (It'll be a new day rising)
And it's all up to you to see the world in a different way
We're not trying to change everybody (Everybody)
People need to change themselves
Just tired of all this talk about money
For me the simple life is what it's all about
Selfishness is a shame
It keeps fanning the flame
Till we help one another
Till we help each other
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a brand new day
It'll be a new day rising
So get on up
Get on your feet and move it
Get on up and change your mind, get to it
Get on up, I know you can do it
Get on up, we can change the world
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
It'll be a new day rising
And it's all up to you, it's all up to you, hey
