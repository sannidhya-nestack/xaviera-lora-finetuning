I ive you, for God ave me
I can love you,'cause Jesus saved me
I can live beyond the hurt that made its way to me
I can look beyond the pain
For God has helped me see
His iveness
His iveness
The sin we have inside our hearts can't come before his throne
We kneel before the Lord, confessing sin that's all our own
We humbly bow and ask iveness in the Savior's name
And we know that when we leave, we won't be the same
We're iven
With His iveness
I ive you
For God ave me
I can love you
Jesus saved me
I can live beyond the hurt that made its way to me
I can look beyond the pain for God has helped me see
His iveness
His iveness
When we come to Jesus' end, we share with Him our fault
He cast away our sins forevermore
We leave them at the cross where our salvation Jesus bought
iveness comes to us and we're restored
The Lord knows all the reasons why we do the things we do
The Lord knows all the pain that's caused when we don't ask him to
To ive us for the things we've done and said about our friends
We justify our actions that are meant to offend
We're iven with His iveness
I ive you, for God ave me
I can love you,'cause Jesus saved me
I can live beyond the hurt that made its way to me
I can look beyond the pain
For God has helped me see His iveness
His iveness
