From my house to his house is a very long road
A road that is cluttered with lost lonely souls
God said give the fallen your helping hand
And they'll lead them to my house
I'll watch over them
From my house to his house
Takes a lifetime to get there
When my life has ended, I want God to be there
From my house to His house, here's a road hard to travel
There are so many detours, put there by the devil
From my house to His house
From my house to his house
There is someone to lead us
God sent him to save us
And his name is Jesus
From my house to his house
And when I get to his house, I'm going to stay
From my house to his house, takes a lifetime to get there
When my life has ended, I want God to be there
From my house to his house
He's a road hard to travel
There are so many detours
Put there by the devil
From my house to his house
From my house
To his house (to his house) (to his house)
From my house (from my house) (to his house)
To his house
