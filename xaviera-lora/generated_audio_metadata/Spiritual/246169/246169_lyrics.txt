On the distant shores of Sharon
Waits the song I long to hear
'Tis the laborer's song of freedom Softly whispering in my ear
My heart yearns to feel the joy When I hear
Hear the Savior's voice, gently calling, "Faithful servant, come on home !"
Weary soldiers of the state
Rest your souls at Jesus' feet
Where we'll hear the song
Sung by angels soft and sweet
With our brothers gone before
We will sing
Song of freedom, sing forever when we're home
On the distant shores of Sharon
Raise the song I long to hear
'Tis the victor's song of freedom gently dancing in my ears
When this life can sing no more
I will stand on that shore
Where my Savior's voice will lead me
To my home
To my home, to my home
He will come, take my hand and lead me home
