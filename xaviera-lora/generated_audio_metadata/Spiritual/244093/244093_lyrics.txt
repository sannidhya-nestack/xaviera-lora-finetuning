We are the children your disciples sent away
We are the lepers turned back at the gate
We are the eunuchs
Not allowed to enter in
We've been told our loving is a sin
But you have a plan for us
Just like you said you would
You have a plan for us
It's only for our good
We found you when we looked for you
With all our heart and soul
You said that we could call you
You promised you would hear us
You've given us a future and a hope
(Future and a hope)
We're the adulteress
You protected from the stones
We are the one in ten
Who came to thank you all alone
We are the prodigal, the prodigal you saw from far away
Yet you run to meet us just to say
That you have a plan for us just like you said you would
You have a plan for us, it's only for our good
We found you when we looked for you with all our heart and soul
You said that we could call you, you promised you would hear us
You've given us a future and a hope
We are the woman at the wheel, the blind man you told not to tell
Samaritan, the outcast in the lane
The harlot and the thief, disciples lost in grief
And yet you've given each of us your name
You have a plan for us
Just like you said you would
You have a plan for us
It's only for our good
We found you when we looked for you
With all our heart and soul
You said that we could call you
You promised you would hear us
You said that we could call you
You promised you would hear us
You've given us a future and a home
You have a plan for us
Future and a hope
