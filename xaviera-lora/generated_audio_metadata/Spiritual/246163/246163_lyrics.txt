Weak though I may be
Father strengthen me with the power
That spoke us to existence
Strength that raised the dead
In my faith be wed, Holy Spirit
My heart cries for assistance, come to me
In my darkest hour, bring me to my feet
I will stand and sing, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Praise to you, my King! Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
Lightning fills the skies, creation testifies to the glory of holy God eternal
Hear the heavens roar, see the Savior's sword, feel the passion
Almighty God immortal
As your power reaches down to me
Bring me to my feet
I will stand and sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Praise to you my King, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the church bells ring, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Whoa, I will stand and sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Jesus spoke to them saying
I am the light of the world
The one who follows me will never walk in darkness
If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it
But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
I give them eternal life, and they will never perish
No one will snatch them out of my hand
Take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to take a stand in that evil day
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven
I will build my church, and the forces of hell will not overpower it
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people
I will stand and sing hallelujah, hallelujah, woah
Praise to you, the King, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, oh-oh-oh
Let the church bells ring, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, oh-oh-oh
I will stand and sing, oh, hallelujah, oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, oh, hallelujah
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Oh, Hallelujah
