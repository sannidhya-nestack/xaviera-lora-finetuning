It's good we go to church on the Lord's day
I wouldn't have it any other way
And it's good we dress at our Sunday best
But the other six days are the test
Between Sundays
Do we try and practice everything we preach
Between Sundays
Do we help the beggar lying on the street
Or do we simply turn away
As if we're in a daze
Like rats caught inside a maze
Are we lost
Between Sundays
Like money that's so easy to spend
It isn't all that hard to love a friend
But the hardest thing is for you and me
To try and love our enemies
Between Sundays
Do we try and practice everything we preach?
Between Sundays
Do we help the beggar lying on the street?
Or do we simply turn away?
As if we're in a daze, like rats caught inside a maze
Are we lost, yeah, between Sundays
Do we let that feeling fade until it's gone
Or do we try and keep that Sunday feeling all week long
Between Sundays
Do we try and practice everything we preach
Between Sundays
Do we help the beggar lying on the street
Or do we simply turn away
As if we're in a daze
Like rats caught inside a maze
Are we lost
Between Sundays, between Sundays, between Sundays
