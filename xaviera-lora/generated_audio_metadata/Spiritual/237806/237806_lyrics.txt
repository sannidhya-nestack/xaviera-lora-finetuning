What greater love has been known than His
Born into sin so that I may live
What greater gift than the Holy Spirit
He will take the pain away
He said, "Fear not, I am with you always
And I am God, so don't be dismayed"
I'll uphold you with my righteous right hand
You don't have to be afraid
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
Take up your burdens and give them to Him
Just believe and He will give you peace
ive your sins and give you eternity
Just like He did for me
He knows your sins but He still loves you
He always cared, He's just waiting on you
Take up your cross and do what you gotta do
It will bring Him so much joy
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
Lookin' not behind me
But to the things in front of me
I press toward the mark
And a higher calling in Christ Jesus
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Come to me all that labor
And a heavy burden
And I'll give you rest
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
What profit a man to gain the whole world yet lose his soul
Ah yeah, yeah, ah yeah
Tell the righteous all will be well with them
For they shall inherit the few to their deeds
Ah yeah, ah yeah
It's His love, it's His mercy, it's His grace, it's His love
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
It's His love, mercy and grace
Is His love, mercy and grace
