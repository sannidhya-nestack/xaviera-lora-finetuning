Everything that, everything that, everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that, everything that
Everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that, let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that, let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Praise you in the morning
Praise you in the evening
Praise you when I'm young and when I'm old
Praise you when I'm laughing
Praise you when I'm grieving
Praise you every season of the soul
If we could see how much you're worth
Your power, your might, your endless love
Surely we would never cease to praise you
But everything that
Let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that, let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Praise you in the heavens, I'm joining with the angels
Praising you forever and a day
Praise you on the earth now, joining with creation
Calling all the nations to your praise
But if we could see how much you're worth
Your power, your might, your endless love
Surely we would never cease to praise
Let everything that, let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that, let everything that, let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Praise you in the morning
Praise you in the evening
Praise you when I'm young and when I'm old
Praise you when I'm laughing
Or even praise you when I'm grieving
Praise you every season of the soul
But if we could see how much you're worth
Your power, your might, your endless love
Surely we would never cease to praise
Praise you, praise you
Let everything that
Let everything that
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that
Let everything that
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let everything that
Everything that
Everything that has breath praise the Lord
Everything that
Oh everything that, everything that has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
