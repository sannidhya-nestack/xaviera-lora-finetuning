Well, the good book says that we all were made
In His image and likeness with a soul in late
Who am I to say any of that isn't true?
God was fallen in love, fallen hard when He made you
What he made you
What he made you
What he made you
From your big brown eyes to your two-toed hair
Flash that brilliant smile, let the people stare
I'll make sure my words never will be misconstrued
God was falling in love, falling hard when he made you
Well he was shutting his stuff, showing off what he could do
Someone should've said enough
Aren't you afraid you're gonna overdo it?
Just a little bit
Now some people think that you're no good
But I just think you're misunderstood
half the time, half of what you say's taboo
God was falling in love, falling hard when he made you
When he made you
When he made you
When he made you
Oh, he was threatening his stuff, showing off what he could do
Someone should've said enough
Aren't you afraid you're gonna overdo it?
Just a little bit
Well, the good book says that we all were made
In His image and likeness with a soul inlaid
Now who am I to say any of that isn't true?
Well, God was falling in love, falling hard, but He made you
Well, He made you
Well, He made you
Well, He made you, yeah
