The book has been written
Their pages have been read
His hand and feet were pierced for my sake
The books will be open
Their pages will be read
And in the day he'll stand and call my name
He stands in the middle of seven golden lamps
Do not be afraid, he's first and last
He died for my sake, now he's alive and well
Behold he holds the keys of life
I exalt Thee, O Lord
For Thou art my strength and my deliverer forever
I exalt Thee, O Lord
My time is in Your hands and for my enemies
Thou dost deliver me
I lift up my eyes, where does my help comes?
My help comes from heaven above
The earth shakes and quakes, its foundations in this name
But his divine ears hears my prayers
I exalt Thee, O Lord
For Thou art my strength and my deliverer forever
I exalt Thee, O Lord
My time is in Your hands and for my enemies
Thou dost deliver me
His face shining like the sun
His feet like burnished bronze
His hair white like white wool like snow
His voice like the sound of many waters running wild
His eyes are like fire in the night
I exalt thee, oh lord
For thou art my strength and my deliverer
Forever, I exalt Thee, O Lord
My time is in Your hands and from my enemies
Doubtless deliver me to Thee, El Santo Señor
Pues eres mi fuerza y mi libertado por siempre
Te exalto Señor
Pues eres mi fuerza y mi libertad
Por siempre
Te exalto Señor
Pues eres mi fuerza y mi libertad
