The world's shaking with the love of God
Great and glorious, let the whole world sing
all you ever do
Let's change the odds for new people
We believe that God is bigger than the air I breathe
The world will leave
God will save the day
And all will say
My glorious, my glorious
Sounds are breaking, the heavens come to earth
Our hearts awaken, let the church bells ring
Let them ring
'Cause all you ever do is change the odds from you
People only believe that God is bigger than the air I breathe
The world will leave
God will save the day
And all will say
My glorious
My glorious
My glorious
My glorious
My glorious
One, two, three, four
My glorious, my glorious, my glorious, my glorious
Glory, glory, send your glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, send your glory
Glory, glory, send your glory
Glory, glory, send your glory
