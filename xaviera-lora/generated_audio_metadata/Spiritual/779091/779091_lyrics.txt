Put my spirit in the wind
When my time has come to rest
I won't need my moccasins
'Cause I am through now with my quest
There's no second time around
Lay my body in the ground
But put my spirit in the wind
Yes, put my spirit in the wind
My spirit in the wind
When we met I was defenseless
I bet my soul for you to see
How the love between our heartbeats
Set my spirit free
No power on earth could stop us
You were destined to love me
Put my spirit in the wind
But my spirit in the wind
When my time has come to rest
I won't need my moccasins, no
'Cause I am through now with my quest
There's no second time around
Lay my body in the ground
But put my spirit in the wind
He has put my spirit in the wind
May the soil I'm buried in
Grow the sweetest mandarin
But burn
My spirit in the wind
