Your love's thrilling, your love's filling
Your love's power makes my life complete
It's so exciting, awe-inspiring
You take the bitter and you make it all sweet
You lay your love on me and you set my spirit free
When I'm walking close to you
I know what I have to do
You help me each day
You won't let me stray
I know you're right there beside me
I know your strong hand will guide my way
I'm so grateful your love's faithful
You show mercy I don't deserve
Your love changed me and rearranged me
Because you give it without reserve
You lay your love on me
And you set my spirit free
When I'm walking close to you
I know what I have to do
You help me stay
You won't let me stray
I know you're right there beside me
I know your strong hand will guide my way
Lay it on me, set my spirit free
Lay your precious love down on me
Lay it on me
Set my spirit free
Lay your precious love down on me
When I'm walking close to you
I know what I have to do
You help me each day
You won't let me stray
I know you're right there beside me
I know your strong hand will guide my way
Lay it on me, set my spirit free
Lay your precious love down on me
Lay it on me
It's our Jubilee
Lay your precious love down on me
Lay it on me
It's our Jubilee
Lay your precious love down on me
Lay it on me
Set my spirit free
Lay your precious blood down on me
Lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me, lay it on me
