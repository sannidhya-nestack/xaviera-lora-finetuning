This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence
Living in me
And I
I'm desperate for you
And I
I'm lost without you
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
The very word
Spoken to me
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
The very word spoken to me
And I, I'm desperate for you
And I, I'm lost without you
And I, I'm desperate for you
And I, I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you, Lord
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Lost without you
Lost without you
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence
Living in me
