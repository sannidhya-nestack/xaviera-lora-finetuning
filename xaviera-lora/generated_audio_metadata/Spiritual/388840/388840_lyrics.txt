Come on and get out of your seat
Come on and get up on your feet
Come on and give your attention to the Creator
Swear your allegiance to the Sustainer
Now we have life and we have it abundantly
Now we have love and we have it abundantly
Because there is an empty tomb
We sing and laugh, we shout and dance
Because of him we live and move in him
We have our sustenance
Come on and lift up your voices
Come on and make joyful noises
Come on and offer your praises
Cause sooner or later
Every hand raises to the sustainer
Now we have life
And we have it abundantly
Now we have love and we have it abundantly
Because there is an empty tomb
We sing and laugh, we shout and dance
Because of him we live and move
In him we have our sustenance
Let the weak say, now I am strong
Fatherless child, run to his arms
Let the unloved be the king's bride
Captives of death, rise up alive
The weak say, now I am strong
Fatherless child, run to his arms
Let the unloved be the king's bride
Captors of death, rise up alive
Because there is an empty tomb
We sing and laugh
We shout and dance
Because of him we live and move
In him we have our sustenance
Because there is an empty tomb
We sing and laugh
We shout and dance
Because of him we live and move
And we have our sustenance
And we have everything
Because of you we breathe
Because of you we live
Because of you we love
