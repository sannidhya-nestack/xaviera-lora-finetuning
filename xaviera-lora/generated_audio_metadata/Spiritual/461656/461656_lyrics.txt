There have been times of misery
Been face to face with cruelty
Life would bring me to my knees
But Jesus was always there for me
Jesus was there for me
He lived in the dark so I could see
Jesus was there, he was there for me
Jesus was always there for me
When things go bad and we despair
Look all around, He's everywhere
Think of the joy and blessed things then
Lift up your voice and sing
Because Jesus was there for me
Living the life so I could see it
Jesus was there, He was there for me
Jesus was there for me
Jesus was there, there, there, always there for me
Jesus was there, he was there for me
Jesus was there, he was there, he was there for me
Lost in the depths he heard my pleas
Jesus reached down and he talked to me
Said, whoa (Jesus was there for me)
Jesus runs death for me
Jesus runs death for me
Jesus runs death for me
Open your eyes and see His hand
It lives in the sky and breathes in the land
His love is in every living thing
This is the gift that Jesus brings, oh
Jesus was always there for me
Jesus was there for me
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always)
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus was always there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus, Jesus, He was there for me (Jesus was always there for me, Jesus)
Jesus, Jesus, He was there for me (Jesus was always there for me)
Jesus, Jesus, He was there for me (He was always there for me, Jesus)
Jesus, Jesus, He was there for me
