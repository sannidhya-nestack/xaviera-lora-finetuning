When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrow lies in billows roll
Whatever my life
Thou hath taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul
Though Satan should bother
And try I should come
Let this blessed assurance come true
That Christ has regarded
My helpless estate
And has shed his own blood for my soul
And it is well
With my soul
And it is well, it is well with my soul
My sin and all the bliss
This glorious thought
My sin not in part but done
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Oh my soul
It is well
With my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
And Lord, haste the day when my face shall be in sight
Clouds be rolled by as a scroll
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
Even so it is well with
My soul
