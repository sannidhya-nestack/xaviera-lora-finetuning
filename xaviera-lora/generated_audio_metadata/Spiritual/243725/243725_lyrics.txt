When Jesus is standing, all heavens rejoicing
And your church is ringing, for this is your time

And the latter temple will surpass the first
O fill up the temple of my heart, Jesus
Your glory is filling
Your glory is filling

You are preparing to come for your bride
A glorious people from every tribe
Redeemed by your blood that purifies
Jesus, you're returning
Jesus, you're returning
Jesus, you're returning
For glorious pride
