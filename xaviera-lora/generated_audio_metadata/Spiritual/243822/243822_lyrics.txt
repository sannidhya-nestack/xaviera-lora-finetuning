I can feel your very presence leading me
Down a road I've never travelled
It's where you're taking me
I may not understand'cause it isn't clear
But I know you've got a plan
There's a reason here
My faith is strong in you
I believe in everything you do
If by my hands your will be done
I will prove my faith is strong
Strong in you
Just when we think we've got our life all synchronized
Then we learn that if you're not in it, we're just out of time
Lead us Lord, we're lost without you
Our mere existence is all about you
Sing it!
My faith is strong in you
I believe in everything you do
If by my hands your will be done
I will prove my faith is strong
Strong in you
My faith is strong in you
I believe in everything you do
It's by my hands your will be done
I will prove my faith is strong
Strong in you
My faith is strong in you
I believe in everything you do
If by my hands your will be done
I will prove my faith is strong
Strong in you
