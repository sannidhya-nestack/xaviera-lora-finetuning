Take my hand, walk beside me
Lift me up if I should fall
For I need your light to guide me
When the night surrounds us all
Oh the road is dark and narrow
But I hear my brother call
Take my hand and walk beside me
Lift me up if I should fall
Leave your sorrows at the altar
Cast your cares on angel wings
Every soul bears the reflection
Of the love another brings
If we share the gifts we're given
We'll not need
Leave your sorrows at the altar
Cast your cares on angel wings
Take my hand, walk beside me
Lift me up if I should fall
For I need your light to guide me
When the night surrounds us all
Oh, the road is dark and narrow
But I hear my sister call
Take my hand
And walk beside me, lift me up if I should fall
Take my hand and walk beside me, lift me up if I should fall
