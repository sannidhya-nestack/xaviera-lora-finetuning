Lord Jesus is a-coming
Salvation has begun
And it's gonna be good news for people everywhere
I went down to the holy water
To join my sisters and brothers
To redeem my soul for the sins I done
And though I've spewed my share of hatred
My crimes will all be abated
the good Lord will provide His Son
And that's gonna be good news for people
Good news for people (good news)
Good news for people everywhere (yeah)
Lord Jesus is a-coming (good news)
Salvation has begun (good news)
And it's gonna be good news for people everywhere (yeah)
Good news, good news
Good news, good news
I felt joy as the Lord came to me
He filled my heart with love
Now I know the way of the righteous man
And now I can find my place in heaven
By being kind to my fellow man
I praise the good Lord who helped me understand
And that's gonna be good news for people
Good news for people, good news for people everywhere
Lord Jesus is a coming, salvation has begun
And it's gonna be good news for people everywhere
You got to praise the Lord
Every day of your life
Come on down to the holy water
To join my sisters and brothers
To redeem your soul for the sins you've done
And though you spew your share of hatred
Your crimes will all be abated
the good Lord will provide His Son
Sing it with me now
Good news for people
Good news, good news for people
Good news, good news for people everywhere
Lord Jesus is a coming, salvation has begun
And it's gonna be good news for people everywhere
Lord Jesus, here's my comment
Salvation has begun
And that's gonna be good news for people everywhere
