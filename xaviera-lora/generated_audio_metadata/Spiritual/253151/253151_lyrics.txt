To you who made the heavens and created the earth
Embrace your breath of life
To you who parted darkness enough for rebirth
On you we rest our sight
You are God who took the formless and shaped it to form
You are God who took the homeless and gave them a home
We are blessed, we are sounded, what can I say?
What we want to say, nothing to do
But even lies to you change everything
But you always stay the same
A few have come before us from far away lands
To leave their legacy
They have given us the courage to take a stand
And so we feel the need
To praise the God who wins the moment
And whose character lasts
To serve a God who wants the future
As well as the past
As we are amazed, we are stunned at words cannot say what we want to say
Nothing to do, but give our lives to you, you've changed everything
But you always stay the same
We are the last, we are the started
Words cannot say what we want to say
Nothing to do but give our lives to you
Change everything but you always stay the same
You always stay the same
You always stay, always stay
Always stay the same
The same, the same
