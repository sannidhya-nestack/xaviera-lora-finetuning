Each belongs, we're all God's children
Each belongs, we're his creation
We all belong, so love one another
Join together hand in hand
Everyone you see
We're all the same, one in the spirit
In every way, a gift of love
We are made from His goodness and His grace
Each belongs, we're all God's children
Each belongs, we're His creation
We all belong, so love one another
Joined together hand in hand
We are children
We're children of the light
Made from His own hands
We shine so very bright
Everyone around you
Everyone you see
Each belongs in His loving hands
Each belongs, we're all God's children
Each belongs, we're His creation
We all belong, so love one another
Join together hand in hand
Each belongs, we're all God's children
Each belongs, we're His creation
We all belong, so love one another
Join together hand in hand
