On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I loved that old cross, where the dearest and best
For a world of love's sinners was laid
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it someday for a crown
To that old rugged cross, how will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me someday
To my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share
So I cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it someday for a crown
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it someday for a crown
