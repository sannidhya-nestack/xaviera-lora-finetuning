Withdraw, a little way
Angels sent to strengthen me
I pray, I pray, yeah
I feel the agony, I pray, yeah
Those around
Those around me they stay asleep
As a friend
No cause to betray me
They come with the shields and the swords
Yet it comes and takes me away
Father, I've never been beaten before
Father, I've never had to fall before
Father, I've never had to die before
But let your will be done, let your will be done
The epitome
To follow behind and deny me three times
Yeah, they mocked me and struck me
Oh, and they're falsely accused, yeah
For sending me away, yeah
They sent me away to be crucified
Father, I've never been beaten before
Father, I've never had to fall before
Father, I've never had to die before
Well, let your will be done
Let your will be done
Hey, withdraw a little weight
An angel sent to strengthen me
But still I pray (still I pray)
Peace and agony I pray
