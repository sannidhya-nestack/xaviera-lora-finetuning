She was a lover, she was a star
She had the vision, love from afar
She's had to suffer, she's had to beg
She's been forsaken, drinking the dregs
She's been a martyr, she's been a bride
She's been mistreated, she's had to hide
She's been so lonely, cold and alone
Now that it's over, she's going home
Mansion in the wind
Let the love begin
Castles in the sky
Love will never die, yeah
Powers of her mind
She will spend her time
Treasures by the street
She will live her dream, yeah
Love's the answer, love will survive
Hold to the mission, love's by our side
Can you believe it, only one choice
Can you receive it, lift your voice
Knight in white armor, faithful and true
Stars in the heavens, they bow to you
Ours is the kingdom
Ours is the power, here is the moment, now is the hour
Castles in the wind, let the love begin
Mansion in the sky
Love will never die
Palace in her mind
She will spend her time
Kingdom by the sea
Love will be
You, keep it coming, you got it
One voice, one heart, one love from above
One say, one way, one day
We'll fly away
One voice, one heart, one love
Only one choice, one say, one way, one day
One voice, one heart, one love, only one choice
One say, one way, one day, we'll fly away
One voice, one heart, one voice
One heart, one love, only one choice
One say, one way, one day we'll fly away
