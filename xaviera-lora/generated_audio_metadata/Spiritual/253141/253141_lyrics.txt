I have no special gift to bring, to give to you, my king
I'm trying still I can't find
A way to compensate for all you've done for me
It's hard to make myself clean
I hope that you don't see me
Through eyes that are my own
I trust your grace to cover
The things that we both know
There's nowhere left to go
So I come (so I come)
I bring these empty hands to you, yes I come (yes I come)
When I don't know what to do, Lord I give myself completely, yes I come
You are worthy to receive the praises from my lips
I offer them now to you
I thank you for the sacred table you prepared for me
Calm you still I feel unclean
Wash away this guilty and penetrating stain
Cleanse and purify my heart take all my pain
I give it all to you
So I come (so I come)
I bring these empty hands to you
Yes I come (yes I come)
When I know not what to do
Lord I give myself completely
Yes I come
So I come, I bring these empty hands to you
Yes I come, when I don't know what to do
So I come, I bring these empty hands to you
Lord, I give myself completely as I give myself completely as I give myself completely as I give myself completely as I come
