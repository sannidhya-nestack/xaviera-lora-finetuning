I wanna buy you diamonds
I wanna buy you pearls
Fly you to every corner of the world
If I only had the means I'd give you everything
But till then have some faith in our little dream
You gotta be all in on love
All in on love
All in on love
You gotta be
You gotta be
You gotta be all in on love
All in on love, all in on love
You gotta be, you gotta be, ooh-ooh
I'm gonna work my tail off and make a happy home, ooh-ooh
I'll fix your car, I'll even fix your telephone, ooh-ooh
I am gonna cherish you like you have never been, ooh-ooh
Love will light up for you baby, if you will join in
You're gonna be all mine
All in all love, all in all love, all in all love, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be all in all love, all in all love, all in all love, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be, you gotta be, all in all love, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be, you gotta be all in our love (you gotta be, you gotta be all in our love)
You gotta be all in our love (ooh, we're a lot of fortune)
You gotta be, you gotta be all in our love (if you'll allow joining my life)
You gotta be all in our love (if we stay alive)
Don't play with those bad boys, they'll mess you up inside (ooh, ooh)
They don't give a damn, they're gonna take you for a ride (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Words but nothing from the heart
Our love is special so come on and take our love
All in all love, all in all love, all in all love
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
All in all love, all in all love, all in all love
Hey, you gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
You gotta be, you gotta be, you gotta be
All in all love
All in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love, all in our love
