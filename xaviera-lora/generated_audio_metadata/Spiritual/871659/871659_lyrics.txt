The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He
Beside the still waters
The lake
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He restoreth my soul, He leadeth me in the path
Of righteousness for His name's sake
Yea, though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
Art with me, for Thou art with me
For Thou art with me
Thy rod and Thy staff may comfort me
Is my shepherd, I shall not want
Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of my nest
Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runneth over
My cup runneth over
My cup runneth over
Runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
And I will dwell
I will dwell
And I will dwell
In the house of the Lord
Forever
