I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die
For poor ordinary people like you and like I
I wander as I wander out under the sky
When Mary birthed Jesus'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh
I wonder, as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus, the Savior, did come for to die
For poor ordinary people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die
For poor ordinary people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the sky
