Light of the world, you step down into darkness
Open my eyes, let me see
The beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with you
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
King of all days oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
And humbly you came to the earth you created
All for love's sake became poor
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
But here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
