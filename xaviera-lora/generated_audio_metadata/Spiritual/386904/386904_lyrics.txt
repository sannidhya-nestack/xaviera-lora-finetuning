A little bit of kindness, a little bit of pain
A little compassion, a little bit of stain
A little iveness, a little bit of blame
A little betrayal, a little bit of shame
When our Saviour comes again
Will we believe His story
Or send Him back from where He came
His kingdom of glory
A little bit of holiness, a little bit of hate
A shot of redemption, a little bit of fate
A little bit of bread and wine, a little bit of blood
Ooh, a little bit of torture, a little bit of love
And when our Savior comes again
Will we believe his story
Or send him back from where he came
His kingdom of glory?
A little bit of healing, the mystery of faith
Crucifixion and the rising, the miracle of grace
And when our Savior comes again
Will we believe His story
Or send Him back from where He came
His Kingdom of Glory
Kingdom of Glory
This kingdom of glory
Kingdom of glory
