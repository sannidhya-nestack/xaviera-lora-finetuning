It's like you're running, it's like you're running my mind now, my mind now
And I'm losing control, you got me tangled up inside now, inside now
Girl you don't even know what you've been doing to me, been doing to me
But the truth at hand is I'm the man you should be with, should be with
Every time you're close to me, girl I just go blind, I can hardly see
And I'm on top of the world for a second, then you leave again, I can't breathe again
Baby I don't really know why the wind blowin', it's so cold like a snow storm up front
Got me thinking about trying to figure it out
Why I get so high when you're coming around, girl
I can't sleep at night because of you
When I'm all twisted up inside because of you
You're all I think about, everyday can't escape
This torture, I need you babe
Need your face, need a place to get away
You took my life, turn it inside and out (you got me now)
You shut the door, no place to go
It's like I'm up a creek without a boat
You're all I want, you're all I need
So baby please, I'm on my knees
Yeah girl you got me now
You're bossy moves, but I'll take it
Of the way you walk, so walk it out
Feel the beat, the way it grooves
You feel it pickin' up in your shoes
You're all I want, you're all I need
So baby please, I'm on my knees
Yeah girl you got me now
I can't sleep at night because of you
When I'm all twisted up inside because of you
You're all I think about, everyday can't escape
This torture I need you babe
Need your face, need a place to get away
I can't sleep at night because of you
And I'm all twisted up inside because of you
You're all I think about everyday can't escape
This torture I need you babe
Need your face need a place to get away
I can't sleep at night because of you
And I'm all twisted up inside because of you
You're all I think about everyday can't escape
This torture I need you babe
Need your face need a place to get away
