With a quick turn of affairs, a spell of activity over there
Down the line, hitting with my fierce stare, hold on tight
This is my night to step into the spotlight
I see you in the dark and thought like a phantom
In a crowd without a shadow of a doubt, vaguely from what I can see
Somebody's got a close watch on me'cause I'm on fire
So stand aside, I'm coming through, hold on
Can you handle it or am I too hot for you? (I'm on fire)
Prop your energy, touch me
You spark my desire but can you make my soul complete?
Take me far beyond what's forbidden
I wanna taste your strange fruit without sinning
Are you willing to indulge my senses? It's clear to me
An obsession seldom seen, a fantasy
You're distracted, it's easily perceived
So I attempt to justify the scene
You know you'll surrender to me eventually
I'm on fire
So stand aside, I'm coming through, hold on
Can you handle it, or am I too hot for you? I'm on fire
Rock your energy, touch me
Spun my desire, but can you make my soul complete?
Now that I have awakened your curiosity
Temperatures rising
Mesmerizing I know you feel the heat
Come a little bit closer to me
Now that I have awakened your curiosity
With a simple melody
Temperatures rising
Mesmerizing I know you feel the heat
'Cause I'm on fire
So stand aside, I'm coming through, hold on
Can you handle it or am I too hot for you?
I'm on fire
From your energy
Touch me
You spark my desire but can you make it more so for me?
I'm on fire
So stand aside, I'm coming through, hold on
Can you handle it or am I too hot for you? I'm on fire
Pump your energy, touch me
Spark my desire but can you make my soul compete?
I'm on fire
