Baby this is love if it wasn't that
If it isn't love but it wasn't facts
It still is you know how us lovers act
You say you'd do anything for me now what the fuck is that
I don't understand what you're saying you're telling me
No more games I'm not playing the Ebony
Or the Ivory I'm just changing our destiny
Cause fate told me that it's amazing don't have to see
You got me on this wild goose chasing for real
I ain't smiled in two days
I'm just tryna figure you out and drown and lose faith
Cause trust me by this time could've found a new face but nah
This love you know I feel for you
It's mutual this love you know you feeling too
Yeah see I just wanna be the woman who you coming home to
No more looking you see it right
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
Look at where the time went
Look at all the time spent
Said we not grossin'
But look at how the line spin
Blood rush times ten
Guess I climb in
I'm in love with my friend
Maybe you
You'll admit it
This very is the growth ride
Me and you still here
Going alright
On the front porch
Staring at the sunset
And we can get there
All it take is one
Said, now I'm living in your lab
In the middle of your cycle
You this and then you that
I'm like, confused
You're clocky, said it just flows
It was cool before I met up with you
Cause you were ice cold
I took but your prize
Said you were Cuban
In a disguise
And you know what I want in life
But you would be everything
And if we don't work it out
He'll never change, yeah
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
The next morning
Still here you call me your best woman
Love came and it never left for this
And this is all I have I ain't got nothing else for
In the feeling it's not foreign I been here before
This is not the first of my recordings in my single or
Living in a dream over Singapore
Feeling of a new day listening to Nina Moore
Yeah here you are you're not fully decided
Tell me your life story
Hold you but quiet, you take me to your world
Look how you pull me inside and you know that you in love
But then you go and deny it, I could be upset
But it's better to let you live
Maybe we run out of time, settle or get too big
But I know I'm in your lap, I'm in your up and down suit
But I'm thinking that you'll come around soon
Cause I'm rooting for ya, yeah
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I'm hoping we can find a way
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I'm hoping we can find a way
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I'm hoping we can find a way
Cause I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
I just wanna get up and go
