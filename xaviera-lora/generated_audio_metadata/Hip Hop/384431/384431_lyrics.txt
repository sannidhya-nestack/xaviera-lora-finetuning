These bougie cats stepped in the scene to cloud my dreams
I've laid ya back with all my hell-ified doja fiends
They grabbed it'cause it's kosher, yo, they start to act fickle
So I'ma grab, we gon' grab your ears and start to tickle
I'll wiggle me back to the follow of my brain
I do it'cause it's freestyle, it's my motherfuckin' game and I'm
Them bougie cats comin', they comin' criticize
You know them bougie cats comin' and they always try to kill the vibe
You know them bougie cats blewin' on a different wind
They act a fool, hey yo, they try to pretend
You know them bougie cats comin', but soon they realize (soon they realize)
That we gon'
Come check it out, yo
Come check it out, yo
Come check it out yo
Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo
Heads need deflating so bed weevils waiting
Patiently with a mic and a cigarette yo
Y'all right with ignorance low class
Get your elbows off my table
Take your shoes off at my door
Who's cruise offering more?
Really yo that's a given
It's not that complicated cause really I'm simply
You breaking, building houses, need to change your form
I'm new school, I moved in and rearranged your dorm
So you should play along, and don't complain I warned
When DOT rocked the house'til the break of dawn
And who's your cats coming, oh they coming to see?
They wanna know what they talk about with the DOT
I say them bougie cats done came
Them bougie cats done when
But Stephen Harper kicked the ass out the tent
You know them bougie cats coming
Oh anonymous please
Backwoods bullshit bullsh *t
Two faces on the corporate jet
Go hide the project hypocrite
Keep the nonsense really why you flossing
I stay in the hand you trash from tossing
Talk this as a lesson when caught in the profession
Far from progressing when guessing a trinsetting
Feel I'm preaching a blessing bringing emcees to confession
Wait'til the end, I'll answer questions
Don't know what to do, get out the profession
Bushi acts, reason for my aggression
Always over-rating, I'm overtaking
They're faking from flossing
Big heads and big egos
Shallow minds and hollow flows
I see now, there's a reason why I can't play on the stage without musicians
We do it land or land tracks with verbal precision
They're blowing up a spot one time for you
We do it'cause you know we make it stick like glue
I see the time is coming, yeah you see us now
We blaze it up and push'em back the crowd
I say we'll never leave because we'll stay on time (stay on time)
We call this shit bougie cat hip hop or say but
You know them bougie cats comin' (they comin')
Oh they comin' to see (oh they comin' to see)
They wanna know what they talk about
Or we hit the D .O .T. (what about that, what about that)
You know them bougie cats done came
Them bougie cats done went
But D .O .T. will always straight represent
You know them bougie cats coming, going anonymously
We pull them down on one knee
