Here we go, here we go
Hit it up, get it on, it's a brand new ride
Heads up, we're coming inside
Born in the west, we roll with the best
Laying down tracks like we possessed
Chris King on the streams
Boy got skills with the blame
I'm Q-Dog Quinn on the mic
Fixing up sinful tracks with a spike
We know y'all ready for the sound
Little salt make you come around
Don't worry cause we got it for you
Do I need to repeat that a boy named Sue
Rhymes that cut like a knife
Put me down for the life
Get ready this ain't no test
You roll with the rest now roll with the best
Loving, living
Lush, that's the way that we roll
Drinkin', smokin', sexin', that's the way that we roll
Cash it, spend it, feel it, that's the way that we roll
Lovin', livin' in the real, yeah that's the way that we roll
Wrapping up the charts to the top
Party keeps going non stop
I'm getting yours and you're getting mine
Who's bad you know we give you a sign
Everything is real on the front
We always down for the hunt
Lip falling out cause the time is right
We feel your love in the house tonight
We know y'all ready for the mix
Lil' something for your bag of chicks
Don't worry cause we got it for you
Let's take a little moment for a quick review
We feel no disrespect
To the crews that we have wrecked
They failed our critical test
They messed with the best and died like the rest
Loving, living
Lodge, that's the way that we roll
Drinkin', smokin', sexin', that's the way that we roll
Cash it, spend it, feel it, that's the way that we roll
Lovin', livin' in the real, yeah that's the way that we roll
That's the way that we roll
That's the way that we roll
Cash it, spend it, feel it
That's the way that we roll
Loving, living in the real
That's the way that we roll
Loving, living, large
That's the way that we roll
Drinking, smoking, sexing
That's the way that we roll
Cash it, spend it, feel it
That's the way that we roll
Loving, living in the real
That's the way that we roll
Loving, living, large
That's the way that we roll
You are our God
Do what you feel
We can sing again
Pleasure with a bang
Loving, living, large, that's the way that we roll
Drinking, smoking, sexing, that's the way that we roll
Cash it, spend it, feel it, that's the way that we roll
Loving, living in the real, yeah that's the way that we roll
Loving, living
That's the way that we roll, drinkin', smokin', sexin'
That's the way that we roll, cashin', spendin', feelin'
That's the way that we roll, lovin', livin' in the real
Yeah, that's the way that we roll, lovin', livin'
Large, that's the way that we roll
Drinkin', smokin', sexin', that's the way that we roll
Passion, offended, feeling, that's the way that we roll
Lovin', livin' in the real, that's the way that we roll
