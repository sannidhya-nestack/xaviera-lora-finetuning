Just tryna get
I swear we tryna get
Yo fast head
Aye yo the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted
The vibe is so dead man you better not waste it
Let's get wasted
Let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They broke some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Finna get wasted
Wasted
Wasted, go and get wasted
Couple beer kegs, that'll drown the perks
Shots of Jamison, that'll drown the vikes
Jager bombs next, I'm beyond nice
Me and the frat bros chillin' we just loungin' perks
Friday night and you only live one time
Weekend is here and you only live one time
YOLO
Yolo drinking with my bros though
Party started yesterday ends when I don't know though
This ain't no Soho party in the backyard
Everybody regular we don't care about stars
This ain't broadway party by the campfire
Great memories me and the whole fam wired
Get hammered drink the beer and flip the cup
Aim the pong ball shoot better not miss the cup
Either way we all winners back to the basics
Ain't here to act up just came to get
Aye yo the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted
The vibe is so dead man you better not waste it
Let's get wasted
Let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They broke some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Finna get wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Go and get wasted
A few bongs lit, couple cans of beer
Take a few shots, we do not care
Shotgun or brew, I meant you too
Something to do when there's nothing to do
Saturday night, we just living for the moment
Never neglected, nah gotta own it
We on it, on it, whatever you could
Think of, we hang out with our wings out
Plus blackin' out is what we on the brink of
Naw this ain't Hollywood, everybody simple
Surrounded by gnarly hoes
Naw this ain't 5th Ave, and all the big cash
Chasing down the joints that give every dude whiplash
Get hammered, drink the beer and flip the cup
Aim the pong ball shoot, better not miss the cup
Either way we all winners, back to the basics
Ain't here to act up, just came to get
Well, the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted, tryna get wasted
The vibe is so there and you better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
The homies here so let's all get wasted
They broke some honey so let's all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
Wasted, wasted, go and get wasted
Damn, we killing it, done
Givin' me a hangover (too many joints here, man)
Yeah, I'm wasted
I hate being sober (got the feelin')
Damn, damn (yeah, I got the feelin')
Yo, look at that shorty over there (feelin' like a villain)
She fly (aw yeah)
I don't know what I'ma do
Somebody please give me some more licks
Yo, pass that Dutch, B
Aye yo the weekend just came and we tryna get wasted
Tryna get wasted, tryna get wasted
The vibe is so there and we better not waste it
Let's get wasted, let's all get wasted
The homies here, so let's all get wasted
They brought some honey, so let's all get wasted
Wasted, wasted, finna get wasted
Wasted, wasted, go and get wasted
