Yeah, from deep town to Tampa
Fat Rock, Tone, T-Cash, yeah
Big Steve, where you at?
I got you, yeah
I'll never fall again, I got up to get out
I mastered the flow, every verse that I spit out's crazy as hell
Think Looney been cokin', it's purest form, pink Peruvian
Don't fuck with other rappers, really, I hate y'all
Fuckin' the game up like steroids and baseball
Fatrock, P-H-A-T-R-O-C, I told you you can't miss these arms
Hope you been waitin' for a beat to beat up
And go off and bounce on the track like big tits and no bra
Bro with a pack of true spitters
Hard flows, all my dogs are sick and running around with barf holes
Right on command, just say okay
Not a DJ give a fuck about the radio play
A new light shining bright to drown out the city stars
Can't touch me like table dance is a city bar
Dead tone in the headphones
Till the beat drops murder you and piss on your headstone
Your girl on my dick and she ringing me now
Just another bitch that I be bringing around
Digging my files, damn clowns trying to figure me out
But they out of it, rockets got a calligraphy style, wow
It's amazing how they chasing me now
Hate until they facing me, faking a smile
Spit in your grill, cock back and give you the deal
Run up the hill, smack jack
I can kick it with Jill, I'm a nuisance
Easy does it, I'm ruthless
Let me go and keep going and see how smokey the booth gets
Rappers say they riders but they hiding at night
To me this shit is just like fucking riding a bike
I might spontaneous bust and drop patriots
Demolish everything in a six block radius
Tone cash, people's choice
Really only rap just to hear my voice
Only rapper in the game who can fill the void
No ghostwriter lyrics, it's the real McCoy
Fundamentally, I develop the beats
And leave a wack ass crew laying dead in the street
I'm a beast, you'll see they surrender to me
They get a second to lead but only second to me
You soft on the mic talking hard shit
Plot to suffer hardship, shot down by a starship
I'm a marksman before a rap artist
Study my target, take charge when I start shit
Independently owned
Oh, most MC's are just owned
Oh, by the labels they chose
Oh, got no places to go
Ah, black out and punch every artist on your label in the face
Cause they fake, they ain't think for they spoke and they know that I'm coming
They should've done nothing instead of coming up with something
Sound dumb like you do like we don't know you frontin'
Every time I turn around they running at the mouth and they gums keep
And I gotta keep dumping
I'm a trigger puller killer with the lyrics when I'm thumping
Tough guys realize that they wasn't
I'm a motherfuckin murderer with music
Who's a nuisance aimed to be abusive
Words of abrasive haters get contusions
Who the fuck you got me confused with
On some true shit you dudes are useless
Only wanna hang and see how my crew spits
Recruit chips, crews recruit chicks
Who use a toothpick to pick my pubics
Out of they teeth I leave you toothless
Spit flows with ease you need some new shit
Kick on the beat, I'll be in the booth, bitch
Have you running for your life like someone's got a knife
In a horror flick chase, that's sorta what it's like
When I hit the pad right, doesn't matter if I'm hype
You blast it on sight, that's all my life
Kids and the wife, motherfucker that's right
Ah, ah, ah
