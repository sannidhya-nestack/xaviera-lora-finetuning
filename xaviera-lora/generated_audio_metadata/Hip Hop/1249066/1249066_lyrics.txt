Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire
A 10 ,000 year itch of hella hot desire
Well let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill
I think she took a little red pill
She's a sight to see miss money
A smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She sweats in her high heeled shoes
Life's gotten better she got everything to lose
Fashion so fly
You have to get in that plane seat at what cost
Lots of pretty penny, come and get some
Would you like a little treat?
Timid heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch, welcome to the circus
Oh miss money
You want sexy sweet honey
Is this game that you adore?
Miss money
Now you've got a little
Would you like a little more?
Miss money
Sweet little honey
I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some things
I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up the love is something that she can't ever seem to get enough
Of a swipe of a card, like to play the part
Crashing it very hard
In the market for a heart
All this money, you're a fantasy
I think about you every day
I won't tell him you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss money, oh she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a physical fairy fluttering by
Pinched by a stock pile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just a blanket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
Below the currency she can't seem to line
Her portfolio of hearts, oh what a poor thing
Fool you with the dividends of love
She'll never really miss money
Oh, she's known to be biased with love
But it's never ever chummy
With the tune of love created in her eye
She's a faithful fairy fluttering by
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold and never pleased
The capital heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a petty pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss Money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A physical failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy by his love
But it's never ever young
With a twinkle of green in her eye
She's a physical fairy fluttering by
So here's who's money to fill up the bowl
May your assets be liquid, liquid
Maybe you're, maybe you're all mine
A market of romance, she movers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of heart is in a deep freeze
But oh, how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much
Miss money, oh, the irony's not lost
Can't budget for love, it's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, but oh Miss Money
You're still a sight in the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh she's no dummy buys love but it's never ever shown
With a twinkle of greed in her eye
She's a fiscal theory fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money
The bellows, the wall, and your assets
Mm, yes, money
Milk
Mm, uh, mm
