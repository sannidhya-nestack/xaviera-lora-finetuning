Gotta give it to'em, yes
Gotta give it to'em, yes, uh, yeah
Gotta give it to'em, uh
Gotta give it to'em, yes
Gotta give it to'em, what?
Uh, there ain't no way
I could ever let'em stop me, son
There ain't no way
Drop'em low
Not for a minute, nor a second
I will not stop, I'm on top
Give it to'em to prove my point
If not, then shoot it through
There ain't no way
I could never ever spit the fame
There ain't no way
Drop'em low
Not for a minute, nor a second
I will not stop, I'm on top
Give it to'em to prove my point
If not, then shoot it through
Yeah
I'm out the frame, parachuting out the plane
Kamikaze hell salasiyah, blow you out of range
My team is banging like a pocket full of change
Stop to rearrange while my whole mind state never change
Never will, never underestimate the skills
Of a criminally minded military
Visionary, legendary, necessary to carry on
None of these images shall I carry on
We walk across the yards of the fields they bury on
So pay respect or break your neck you're caught in slipping fall accidents
We need a doctor or some ambulance some sort of intelligence
Blood on the ground nobody found
We pound for pound in this stadium arena
This source max every cyclones and the nina
This red dot in between your two eyes make you lean a little closer to the skies now
Surprise nobody dies
My niggas on the rise
So don't become subjected to the lies
We the truth living proof aim and shoot
So run along with your Fuji-Lai lines
Mic source signing or a boom bitty bye bye
I could never let them stop me son, drop a roll
Not for a minute nor a second I will not stop
I'm on top give it to them to prove my point
If not then shoot it through
I could never ever spit the fame, drop a roll
Not for a minute nor a second I will not stop
I'm on top give it to them to prove my point
If not then shoot it through
You catch them talking like they some riders
Right beside you as soon as they ass alone
They find places to hop to
It ain't hard to tell that them boys ain't G
Ride all they want to but they ass ain't me
Believe I get it poppin', poppin' I get it
Is you with it? I mix it to sip it
Twist it to hit it, get me lifted and passion I feel it
Beef I got a semi on my status, living
Hopin' to get a million, selling my dreams
To fiends in the bottom of the dirty
Drug money got blood on it
I'm thirsty, tasting the residue, my soul for sale, I think not
Don't like me then, go ahead and bring shots
I'm not dead, not scared, I'm prepared
Anytime, anywhere, want war, I'm right here
I won't run from none of you punk busters
You want my spot? Then come and get it, mother
I could never ever spit the fame (there ain't no way) drop or roll (nah nah)
Not for a minute, not a second, I will not stop, I'm on top (yeah, check it out one sec)
Give it to'em to prove my point, if not then shoot it through (there ain't no way)
I could never ever spit the fame (there ain’t no way) drop or roll (nah nah)
Not for a minute, not a second, I will not stop, I'm on top (yeah, check it out one sec)
Give it to'em to prove my point, if not then shoot it through (yeah, check it out one sec)
So here we go down the yellow brick road, get old and commode
The clones told me stick to the flows, stick to my ones
Lay back with my dick to the sun, spit 97 hot tracks
Y'all niggas picking this one, got my soul express ticket
Living living, your favorite rapper thought he was hot but really isn't
This tribe borough solid killer with the Michael Jackson type of thriller
Confidential like envelopes made out of manila
Fill up the pitcher or take a picture, yo son I'll break the next
With plans to try to make me richer
Scheming and plotting my genius is knocking
My team is watching like swords
Please give up MZN for boxing
Leave em no option G's in my socks and
25, 35, 50 cent between each of my pockets
A speaker and prophet with lyrical partners
No breaks on the train so please stop us
I keep the story blunt like I was a weed doctor
Your people screaming like S-O-R-C
Knocked us the conductor on the train
On the track on the rail on the menu
Serving cats till we all fat
I could never let em stop me son
Not for a minute, not a second, I will not stop, I'm on top
Give it to'em to prove my point, if not, then shoot it through (there ain't no way)
I could never ever spit the fake (there ain't no way)
Drop the rope (not for a minute, not a second, I will not stop, I'm on top)
Give it to'em to prove my point, if not, then shoot it through
Gotta give it to'em, yes, gotta give it to'em, yes, uh, yeah
Gotta give it to'em, uh, gotta give it to'em, yes
Gotta give it to'em, what? Gotta give it to'em, yes
