Come on, come on, come on Tisha, my hot favorite
Way to go, way to go
On this scene you're gonna get your Z
No hoes, no jokes if you know what I mean
Put our heads together, they are steady to go far
We gonna make this wish a bonus card
I'm coming home with a room and a man around
Let's get going on my company and put it from the ground
The place where I come from
Not for the money I've been in the clan
Just been there to the land of the bitch and spread it to race too
I come to the farm with my hits and IQ
No one is a prophet in his motherland
What do you make of it?
Oh, what can't she do then?
Home is where the heart is, when heart is on to music
She won't let anything get in the way of the history party
Come on!
Honey, give me another chance
No drinking
You can put me to the test (I know that I won't blow it)
You'll never get the chance (to make me lose my faith)
I can't run away from my God-forsaken place
They wanted me to sing things they couldn't care less
With my hips to the audience dance
But with the times passed this passed on me by
So all I belong is all demand and supply
And no one is a prophet in his motherland
Before you're in bed with it, go for it, don't leave it too late
On my way from home, my home is inside me
I won't let anything get in the way that leads to the party, don't you?
Give me every chance, no drinking, no gimming
You can put me to the test, I'm on it
I can't get the chance (I'ma tell you in my face)
I came all the way from my godforsaken place
But you gave me a chance
No drinking, no giving
You can put me to the test, I know
Can I ever get the chance? (To make you leave me with nothing)
I'd come all the way if I make it for a second place
Would you give me a chance? (No drinking, no giving)
You can put me to the test
Can't ever get the chance (to make you leave me with my fate)
I came all the way from a godforsaken place
