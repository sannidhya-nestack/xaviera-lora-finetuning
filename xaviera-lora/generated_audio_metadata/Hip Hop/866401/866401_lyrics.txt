My mistakes (my mistakes, yeah)
Kept me from (kept me from)
Raising my financial (raising my financial)
All the days (all the days)
I could have done a little extra, go away
These thoughts of never getting up again
Good things wait, good things wait
Continue working, ain't no giving in
Ever paid triple for what something is worth?
I can say that trouble runs in our family for sure
Don't get me wrong for every sickness there is a cure
But for my people that's making it a buried in the dirt
Negative account balance is fifteenth and the first
Not to mention the car that won't start to make it worse
I worked one hundred plus
Stay straight, man, I was living at work
Come home, tired, my girl wonder why I'm being a jerk
Say excuse my twelve hour shift, self for being the worst
When there's only one job, maybe my attitude hurts
Until then, really sorry if I scream or I curse
Lord knows this young man does what he can to be pure
And father, please ive me'cause it's been a minute since church
But being a child of God in you is safe for us hurts
So please proceed to watch over my home and bodies in those shirts
By the way, thanks for my mom always having cash all in her purse, yeah
My mistakes kept me from reaching my potential all the days
I could have done a little extra go away
These thoughts of never getting up again
Good things wait, good things wait
Continue working, ain't no giving in
Levels to all of the madness and the sadness
Losing all of our blackness to the badness
Shooters dead in the streets but we savage man
White cops doing the same, it's like a habit
Videos of murder still get off
Footage of testimonies getting lost
Meanwhile in that prison
We get tossed for crimes that we had nothing to do with at all
Cutting right up family I'm sorry for your loss
That story years later still breaking my heart
For centuries they try to tear us apart
Yet we refuse we just getting more strong
Can't we just get along? Oh yeah
What they want, rather our spirits broken or gone
Made it through slavery, lynches, government corruption
And we flourished, demolished, accomplished
Best believe there's no way of us holocaustin'
Million man, modest flow
Name someone else who's gonna stop me
My mistakes came from reaching my potential
All the days I could have done a little extra go away
These thoughts of never getting up again
Cause there's ways they way continue working and no giving in
