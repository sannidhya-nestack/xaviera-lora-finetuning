All my homies, they be slingin' a rock show, and them honey's blazin' up in the spot show, all the niggas drop-toppin' a block show
Hey yo, step into the spot, strobe light, steady spinning
Spot this dime piece dressed up in silk, white linen
First approach, how you doing?
What's your name? No cum, oh go back, damn
Reject the game, second step, same spot, no girl to be found
Oh well, might as well keep walking around
Then they hit me
Damn right in front of my eyes
Five six jet black hair and caramel thighs
Last chance last call if our alcohol was made
Step to her with two glasses of alazane
She's all into it acting like she wasn't
By the way who you here with?
You here with your cousin?
The vibe was cool it's about to be on
Won't you grab your coat yo
And let me take you home she said cool
Let me tell my peeps I'm leaving one and you know
Her cousin the girl I hit last weekend
Soy papi chulo yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangria
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ria
All my homies they be slayin' the rock show
And them honeys blazin' up in the spot show
All the niggas drop-droppin' the block show
Kenny Pearl hotboxin' the box show
Now I'm dipping in the ride to write your praise song
Where to see my homie Nate Cole, cripping the walk, you see him
Niggas ball like bounce skate rock until we hopping off the block
Kocock the killing county cops, it's in the city of south central LA
Where homies like to grill and party and kick the floor plate
To camaradas and hiders that get the groove on
Move on, don't load just get your groove on
It's out the fridge for 40 ounce for O .E. Schlitz
Malt liquor to Saint Ives and long drinks
Two my homies with Cadillacs and pump thrills
Three wheel rollin' with gold ribs and candy pearls
He know it's all to hot spots and Ford Flicks
Night clubs runnin' and drink hoes and chop shit
Niggas come to rub a wrist with Double Down
Dragon's last club and it's all to get that grindin' down (Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno)
(Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros)
(Con mis homies bebo mucha sangría)
(Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ría)
All my homies they been slinging them rocks yo
And them honeys blazing up in the spot yo
All the niggas drop top in the block yo
Katy Pearl hot box in the fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangria
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ria
All my homies they be slingin' them rock show
And them honeys blazin' up in the spot show
All the niggas drop-droppin' a block show
Kenny Pearl, Hotbox, and the Fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
