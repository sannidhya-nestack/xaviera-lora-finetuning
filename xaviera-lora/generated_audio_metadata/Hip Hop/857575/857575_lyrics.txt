I'm the kingpin, I return to blaze mics
One against another my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big hands to fight
The bad super villain is here with all might
I'm the kingpin, I return to blaze mics
One against another my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big hands to fight
The bad super villain is here
I'm the kingpin, big bad and official
Plotting many graves my brain trips
I'm all levels like most devils
Deep down in hell
Sell abomination out of control
I bark like old yeller from old cheddar
Spreading pain like bad weather
Domination ready to rule
I'm tougher than leather
No dare devil
Top grade like hard metal
Burning out of money control
I spit for fame clever
From old treasures
Quick fix with big letters
K-I-N-G-P-I-N
It's all measured
For rich pleasures
Pit gang the broke never
The Frankie five fingers of all time
I rhyme better
The trend setter
Bob boss like good fellas
Tony Montana is small time
To my terror
The raw error
Mike styles to Paul Barrett's better
Watch your back the kingpin is all great
I'm the kingpin
I return to Blaze Mike's
One against another, my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big hands to fight
The bad super villain is here with all might
I'm the kingpin, I return to blaze mics
One against another, my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big hands to fight
The bad super villain is here
Here come the super threat
Marvel King the bad breed
Scheming on the boroughs of Lin Wood
My flows mean
My main steam is makeshift domain
Stream manipulating ways is my crime for cash cream
I'm from the rap scene
Within a comic dream
Stan Lee the author in white suits
A dress clean
I'm stress free
Big neck, I flex these
Massive like no other
My live shows on MTV
My main theme is hardcore
Like Tough Me the muscle fools
Right off the block just like the army
I'm raw, G-go prime time like Ali, the greatest of them all time
Just try to stop me, I bring the pain inside your little brain
Kickin' mesmerizing lyrics, my pedigree is pure fame
No gang bang or trip set from my name
The kingpin is comin' to your hood like black rain
I'm the kingpin, I return to blaze mics
One against another, my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big heads to fight
The bad super villain is here with all might
I'm the kingpin
I return to blaze mics
One against another my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big heads to fight
The bad super villain is here
I'm the kingpin
I return to blaze mics
One against another my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big heads to fight
The bad super villain is here with all might
I'm the kingpin, I return to blaze mics
One against another my rhyme style is tight
I'm the hard type with big hands to fight
The bad super villain is here
