All my girls get down on the floor
Move it like this, so here we go
Back to back, drop it down real low
This is what we came here for
Hey DJ, keep playing the game
It's all for the money, it's all for the fame
Music's playing around
The love I found is here on ground
Keep on rocking
Keep on dancing
Keep on knocking to the beat
Funny because I got to have it
To show the stars that's what I need
I ain't mad at you (I'm doing my own thing)
There's some weight for you (I'm living like a queen)
