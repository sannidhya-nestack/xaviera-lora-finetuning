Sip on the rib meat, now she's begging me for more like dem meat
Feel how she feel again, pop another pill again

I travel the world, I'm a hunter at the hill
When I'm in town, we can get down
Cause I'm freaky just like you
Take your thongs off, spin'em in the air
Wave your freak flag like you just on Kia'ai
Like the way you move your body from your waist high
Like that's your freak flag just in case I
Wanna taste your body
