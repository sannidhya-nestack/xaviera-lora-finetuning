Yo man why don't you break me off a little son?
Like that, go ahead baby, let's ride, in the mix, like that like this, yeah yeah come on, give it to me
All I know when I, all I see, all I know when I
Straight love for the way your body's pumping
In so many ways
Talking about non weight that's something
But if I'm bathed for the fact that I roll like a roller loach
Excuse me miss you got me twisting like some chronic smoke
Straight bumping up on the fat one somewhat feening for your body
It's human nature to be deep low and down right naughty
See me fantasizing about you and every little thing you do
If I could I would gotta be the one freaking you
No second of thought but I'm in game with my conversation
Permission to be on fire when it comes down to no hesitation
I do you and you do me see it's a done deal
Simply for the way I feel all I ask is to come real
So baby won't you give it to me and I'll give it to you
Give it to me and I'll give it to you
No doubt about it, love of the finest, woman
For the ways of class and finesse
Stressed out about the way you got me sprung
For the rest of the rest, nevertheless hooked on intense
Passion, my intuition
Honey coated candy drop, hit'em up much with precision
Take a test drive, my sex drive
To the break of dawn for the pack, let's ride down to the west side
No love for the money, grubbin' tight, block nine, no chewing hose
Hit'em up with a true pack of players and straight up gigolos
No second of thought, put'em on and game with this conversation
Pummin' shit to be on point when it comes down to no hesitation
I do you and you do me, see it's a done deal
Simply for the way I feel all I ask is to come real
So baby won't you just give it to me and I'll give it to you
Give it to me and I'll give it to you
Sweet like sugar but at the same time
Sour for the fact only attracted to the dollar sign
Between the lines scandalous with the money grubbing
Tell me that ain't something
Somewhat sort of a hooker cause it costs for her loving
Never giving up some sort of a dime
PC ain't no teller but it goes down in the 90's
So better watch for these games that these tricks play nowadays
Never to wake up or wake up in the morning with AIDS
Give it up all some sort of a way how she could get mine
But the fact that she ain't worth a food stamp at the county line
It was good while it lasted drastic and malicious
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (That's right, come on, candy drop)
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (Candy drop)
Give it to me and I'll give it to you
Give it to me, and I'll give it to you (that's right)
La la la la la la la (that's right)
Give it, give it to me (I know what you want)
Give it, give it to me (I see it in your eyes, I see it clearly, don't cry)
Just real, ill, come on get with the real baby
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (give it to me, give it to me)
Give it to me and I'll give it to you (give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
