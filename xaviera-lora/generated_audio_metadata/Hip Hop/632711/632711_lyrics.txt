Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up, oh
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up, what?
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up, oh
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up
What I know a lot of y'all wouldn't expect it
Odd I see these speedys way above hectic
I been elected so y'all best sit on your ass real fast
Because I'm shocking like electric
All girls hating quick hit the exit
Keep it up get beating up or get your head split
I'm coming through with more flavors than Nesquik ain't desperate
Making fresh hits now check the next bit
I set trends on stage when you doing your PAs
You copy my page I heard it from my best friends
Well I'm a veteran in this game
Perfected with the aim
Corrected when I'm saying I'm from the west ends
Rocks and bang like a rock band
You hand with the heart gang to take over your black man
Stop man I'm so hot I bring the humid
You need to get the vet up so shut the head up stupid
Party people party mama
Take it down and turn it up (oh)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (what?)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (oh)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (turn it up, turn it up)
I'm the hottest girl around
I rip shows, spit flows till you twirl around
Don't mistake it, I'ma make it, I'm determined now
Better bounce, I'm in the house and it's burning down
I don't care what you heard, I don't care what you know
Listen to this girl as she's tearing the floor
I'm raring to go, we're preparing for shows
You yap that I'm whack but you're there all day
Strong and she heavy, body look good, face look pretty
Me wouda spend you just like a money
Me wouda take you home and show my mummy
Inside the club you drive the man crazy, yeah
You tell the man them traps it herby
If a money you make then go and go make it
If your booty big you go and go shake it so (yo)
Party people party man
Take it down and turn it up (oh)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (what?)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (oh)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (what?)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up (oh)
Party people, put'em up
Take it down and turn it up

Party people put'em up
