Coming with the word from the bottom let's speak
Everybody love I'm doing my thing
The blacks, the whites, the Caribbean's
My raps is tight, I'm overseas
So I oversee when I step in the scene
I cop so clean you know what I mean
I'm the same OG, I'm the latest dream
When I rock the beat
Everybody scream, yeah that's right I'm gonna rock all night
I'm the man of the party playa what's up now
Don't get mad'cause I'm shining brighter with your turn
Before you turn I make a video for the world to see
Hip hop lives I'm a symbol of it
Backstage I see another chick
With a fat booty steady looking at me
I take her to the dressing room hit it from the back
Boom boom she like it like that
Oh what's that line? I'ma take your ass out
Not to dinner I mean yo my dinner
Baby you so wack vapa so I'm gonna eat your liver
With the rhymes I deliver please don't be a non-deliverer
Hey check what's that line? I'ma take your ass out
Polygamy style somewhere up in the sky
All you gotta do is find it cause I find mine
Old style when I rap into the crowd
That's why I rap like that original from the hat
Every believe in yourself otherwise you just eject
I believe in myself to get the cash I got the sweat
You want the cash, the girls and the cars
You can't get it but first you gotta get it in out your mind
Every believe in yourself otherwise you just eject
I be overseas when I step into scene
I cut so clean you know what I mean
I'm the same OG I'm the latest dream
When I rock the beat everybody scream
Overseas when I step into scene
I cut so clean you know what I mean
I'm the summing with the word from the bottomless pit
Everybody love how I'm doing my thing
The blacks, the whites, they carry things
My life is tight, I'm overseas
So I'm coming with the world from the bottomless pit
Yeah that's right, I'm gonna rock all night
I'm the man of the party, playa what's up now
Don't get mad'cause I'm shining, betta wait your turn
Before you try to get a cake, betta get that bread
If you thinking it's a game, you gon' have to learn
I'm a tenner, make a video for the world to see
Hip hop lives, I'm a symbol of it
Playing my hits while I'm pushing my whip
Oh yeah, I'm a pimp, you can see it from the veins
Coming with the world from the bottomless pit
Everybody love how I'm doing my thing
The blacks, the whites, the Caribbean
My rap's the same, I'm overseas
So I'm coming with the word from the bottom, let's speak
This is serious, suckers getting furious
I'm like a virus spreading over zillias
This is serious, suckers getting furious
I'm like a virus spreading over zillias
Leave in yourself otherwise you just eject
