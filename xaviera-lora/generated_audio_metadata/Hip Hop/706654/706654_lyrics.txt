Far too long
Take a flight in my mind's home
To wake up in a whole different time zone
I'm prone to stay miles above it
In the skies we hover
Light a fire up under ya
Ride the sunset fly as you wanna
Catch the sunrise the other side is the summer
Some eyes look to say
The shroud from the grey clouds end up miles away
I'm blissed out so I skip town
And high on the vibe that won't let me sit down
Feeling like doing yoga in the aisle
et about it so to have a stogie and a smile
Yeah there must be the fumes
No leg room and legumes for the meal
Still feeling like a million dollar bill
With my eyes on the reel when I'm thinking what's real
The stewardess moves her hips in a way that
To the fact that my seat's in the way back
Still relax, cool breeze with some Ray-Bans
Good fortune, rap game, say jack
Rap pack with a wave cap
Old soul, new school on the same track
It blends well like whiskey and ginger
Intern, we book a flight in winter
Gone with the wind, sir
We will go to waters unknown
Far from home, watch we go
Green light to catch a red eye
Far and wide been far too long
We will go to waters unknown
Far from home watch we go
Green light to catch a red eye
Far and wide and far too long
Let's celebrate life at any rate
Life at this pace it's lights and they bright and then they fade away
Surf on a wave it's certain to hurt with a face full of dirt
But yo you're alive and yep you're on earth
Until the curtains pull got the personal ghost
The further I go feel like searching this globe
Slurping up soup in some humble abode
Catch the ill reflex from the sun when it goes
Over the hills over the road
So how it feels when you follow your soul
Dusty foot traveler salute to the pursuit of truth and happiness
I'm through the roof like a meteor
Keys in a car leaving it all behind because
It's hella hot this groove that's tele got
I'm relegated to a demigod I just read about it
Borderlands and the federale's fed up
In the ways in which things end up so
Send mail send love
We got it all pent up and that's why that's why
We will go to waters unknown
Far from home watch we go
Green light to catch a red eye
Far and wide been far too long
We will go to waters unknown
Far from home watch we go
Green light to catch a red eye
Far and wide been far too long
We will go to waters unknown
Far from home watch we go
Green light to catch a red eye
Far and wide been far too long
Long nights and short days
The motto is
Car lights and four lanes
Follow it
Far flight to for rent
You gotta live
Plan to expand with no plans
Put some bass in your voice
Long nights and short days
The motto is
Car lights and four lanes
Follow it
Far flight to for rent
You gotta live
Plan to expand with no plans
Save it with your chest
Long nights and short days
The motto is
Car lights and four lanes
Follow it
Far flight to for rent
You gotta live
Plan to expand with no plans
Long nights and short days (the amount of whiz)
Car lights and four lanes (the amount of whiz)
Far flights and foreign (you gotta live)
The plans to expand with no plans
That a boy, there you go
The green light, yeah, about the green light, yeah, about the green light, yeah, about the green light, yeah, about the green light, yeah, about the green light, yeah
At the green light, at the green, hyphen drive, at the green light, at the green, hyphen drive, at the green light, at the green, hyphen drive
