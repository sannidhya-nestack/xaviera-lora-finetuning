In the night, you are black lipstick on my lips
Walking through the shadows, I'm on an eclipse
Each step I take, the ground whispers and rips
In the moonlight, my name, the night slides lips
In the mirror, a queen, no script
Eyes wide, fierce, unequipped
Black lipstick lips, breaking the norms
In the night, when my spirit transforms
Not just a color, it's a storm
In the dark, I find that true form
Black lipstick, watch my story unfold
Black lipstick, my signature, my script
Velvet night, my canvas, I'm the artist
Black lipstick, my armor, I enlist
Under the stars, my path I twist
With every beat, I can't resist
Wrap it up with a twist of my wrist
Black lipstick, my eternal trace everywhere
A promise can't dismiss
In this world, my mark I insist
Black lipstick, watch my story unfold
Black lipstick, my signature, my script
In the night, my power I uplift
With every word, the universe I shift
Midnight hue, black lipstick on my lips
Walking through the shadows, I'm on an eclipse
Each step I take, the ground whispers and rips
In the moonlight, my name, the night sky slips
In the mirror, a queen, no script
Eyes wide, fears on me, clipped
Black lipstick, watch my story unfold
Black lipstick, my signature, my script
Black lipstick, watch my story unfold
Black lipstick, my signature, my script
Black lipstick, watch my story unfold
Black lipstick, my signature, my script
