Party people, party'em up
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, party'em up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, party'em up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, pour them up, come on
Take it down and turn it up
Yo, I know a lot of yo wouldn't expect it
Odd, I see this beat is way above hectic
I been elected, so yo best sit on your ass real fast
Because I'm shocking like electric
I know girls saying quick hit the exit
Keep it up get beaten up or get your head split
I'm coming through with more flavours than Nesquik
Ain't desperate making fresh hits now check the next fact
I set trends on stage when you're doing your PA's
You copy my page I heard it from my best friends
But I'm a veteran in this game
Perfected with the aim
Corrected when I'm staying out from the West End
Rock standing like a rock band
You hand with the hot gang to take over your black man
Stop man I'm so hot I bring the humid
You need to get the vet up so shut the hell up stupid
Party people party up
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, pour them up, oh
Take it down and turn it up, what?
Party people, pour them up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, pour them up, oh
Take it down and turn it up, what?
Oh, I wanna see you turn it up, oh
Yo I'm the hottest girl around
A rich show speed flows till you twirl around
Don't mistake it I'ma make it I'm determined now
Better bounce I'm in the house and it's burning down
I don't care what you heard I don't care what you know
Listen to this girl as she's tearing the floor
I'm raring to go we're preparing for shows
You yap that I'm whack but you're there in the rose
Now you know I got skills
Keeping you buzzing more than those that pop pills
The industry had a gap but now the spots filled
In the street full of rappers but most is not ill
Exposure I get knocking cause you're hearing my voice
I'm rapping with a passion you can hear it in my voice
People's choice, rocks and these beats
You can't get cold so we're bringing heat to the streets
Party people, party up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, pour them up, oh
Take it down and turn it up, what?
Party people, party up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, pour them up, oh
Take it down and turn it up, what?
Party people, pour it up, yo
Take it down and turn it up, yo
Party people, pour it up, yo
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, party up
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, party up
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, party up
Take it down and turn it up
Party people, party up
