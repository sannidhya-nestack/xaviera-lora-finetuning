Turn off the TV step outside
Turn off the TV step outside
Turn off the TV step outside
I've been around the world, seen more through eyes of mine
I scaled mountains that took eight days to climb
Led treks through the deepest jungles, ate bananas by the bundles
Crossed seas through underground tunnels
Made mates from down under like crocodile hunter
If you like hot weather you could follow the sun but the surf's up
Wipe out, what a bummer, my next destination's somewhat unpopulated
Maybe learn another language, spark conversations
Ditch the dirty deeds done by my dirty nations
Of crooked politics that turn free thinkers into angry hostages
Hooped up in offices behind the desk pushing labor, I'll see you later
That ain't the life for me, I'm on the hunt for something greater
Worth more than all the paper
The thought of not knowing, going seeing where it takes ya
I track the trail of life, Globetrotting on the daily
Cause searching for adventures keeps me active while I'm aging
This world is so amazing, open your eyes
Turn off the TV step outside, pick a place, take a ride
Bring your fantasies to life, but please don't et to pack light
You gotta keep moving, always learning something new
And if I can do it you can do it, Globetrot I
Roamed the globe to find that great unknown
So many miles away from home
Finally on my own I find strength through the struggles
Elevate my hustle, dig deep like a shovel
Exercise every muscle, create my own path
No need for a road map, cruising like a nomad
Now you know that Mr Adams is the Globetrotter
Cali to Asia, Egypt to Havana
Far from a prima donna, I'm LinkedIn
Network with journeymen
I fly the friendly skies
I climb the pyramids
Sip tequila at the northern border
Study that new world order
Cause life is short and we only getting older
And time is precious
From baby steps to many questions
Traverse the universe in search of new dimensions
Every day's another lesson
Man I gotta stay strong so I can prove I'm all wrong
Damn I got it going on
I trek the trail of life
Globe trotting on the daily
Cause searching for adventures keeps me active while I'm aging
This world is so amazing
Open your eyes
Turn off the TV step outside
Take a ride, bring your fantasies to life
But please don't et to pack like you gotta keep moving
Always learning something new and if I can do it you can do it
Love child, well I'm a tidal wave survivor
Overseas socializer, my passport's expired but I'm still above the clouds
Engaged in aviation, earning frequent flyer miles
Cruise through time zones in style, exchanging smiles and making contact
Living out my backpack, my needs are basic, I roomed in tombs considered ancient
Rolling stone proper placement, remaining patient, creating base shit
So face it, I'm gonna make it to the next destination
Trials, tribulations, so many temptations
When you're mass communicating, I'm educated
By the experience I've gained, I ain't too proud to change
Why would I stay the same? I'm a modern marvel
Blazing trails that you can follow
I'm here today and gone tomorrow
But save your sorrow
My exit ain't a farewell
Cause I return without fail
And brand new stories to tell
I trek the trail of life
Globe trotting on the daily
Cause searching for adventures keeps me active while I'm aging
This world is so amazing
Open your eyes
Turn off the TV, step outside
Pick a place, take a ride
Bring your fantasies to life
But please don't et to pack light
You gotta keep moving
Always learning something new
And if I can do it, you can do it
Low-chop (keep on moving)
Don't stop, life is a time
