I need all my Albertans to report to the dance floor right now
Black Pearl's got a sassy why she whine with it (uh)
So epic how I give it to her (woo)
It's the return and Mr. said it off
You remember Big Daddy you remember that feeling (yeah)
Still VIP with Cleo for some Willys (right)
Still import the finest of fine women
Billionaire for 33 you can see it all in it (uh)
Jumbo win, no tank tank in me
Got me sleeping in the bank of the vault the next Christmas (woo)
Shawty got eyes on the money the next Wednesday (fuck)
Monet Franklin, Vick the Define Lennox (say)
Rodeo with millennia all in'em (uh)
For the girl, yeah, I can brought juice in the thong with her
So attached to the vipper in line, we not chillin', it's the same routine
Straggin' make me a different scene, you clean, I'm clean (cool team)
Say, when they told you do a big turnaround, they told you do a jumbo
If not, you can't glow, I froze so hard it all the damn floor
And it's that part that all the girl know
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work (work, work, work, work, work)
Work, work, work, work, work, work (work, work, work, work, work, work)
Do it (do it), do it (do it), do it (do it), do it (do it), do it (do it)
Do it, now that's a jumbo whip, ah
Work, here I go, finna make the real goods get down on the floor
Everybody hands up when I walk in the door
Just doing what I love, I shine and get dope
Rhyming, bento, doing the demos
You can do it like that, Shawty do it like oh
Yeah, they see me coming, M-R-D, no introduction
Buss it wide open, sippin' and blowin' open
I'm focused, jump or jump on it (on it)
Better tell somebody, fresh to death and I'm fly like pilots
Straight wildin', yes, I be stylin'
Me and my dawg killin' the moment of silence
It's time to ride, now get your hands up
We doin' the jumbo, crank it, turn up
Say, I done told you do a big turn around until you do a jumbo
Look like you can't glow, I froth so hard at all the damn clubs
And this that part that all the girls love
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Now that's a jump on wind
Say when they told you do a big turn around they told you do a jumbo
With light you can't glow
I frothed so hard at all the damn club
And missed that part that I oughta grow a little
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, work, Work, work
Do it, do it, do it, do It
Do it, do it, do it
Now that's a jump on wind
It's time to rap! Dang! Frothy man bring this one, BITE!
