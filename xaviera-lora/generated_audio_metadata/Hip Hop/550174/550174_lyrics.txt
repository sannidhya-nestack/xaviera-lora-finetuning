Now as I gets lyrical to illustrate the soundscape
My DJ gets physical dropping a soul break
You know we got the J-A-Z-Z, Y type essence
With street type lessons that the gods addressing when I bless it
Microphone I stay stone like Chris Rock late night with pure black insight
Now you can bounce if you want to, lounge if you want to
Do what you got to as long as you stay true to
The hip life
Now you can bounce if you want to
Lounge if you want to
Do what you got to
As long as you stay true to
The hip life
Time, space, what is that like?
Just how we living when in the hip life
The hip life
Time, space, what is that like?
Just how we living when in the hip life
The hip life
In the year of'89 stole back my black mind
Found peace not from the east I shine
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush for minds to taste
Space is the place for the cosmic paper chase
Mitch Beer is the face on the fretless bass
With a flawless pace, zoom
Zoom zoom
Now you can bounce if you want to
Lounge if you want to
Do what you got to as long as you stay true to
The hip life
And you can bounce if you want to
Lounge if you want to
Do what you got to
As long as you stay true to
The hip life
The hip life
The hip life
