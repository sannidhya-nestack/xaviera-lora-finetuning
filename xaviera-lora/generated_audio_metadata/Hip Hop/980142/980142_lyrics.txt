Funny how love changes arithmetic
Let me show you how one and one make three
Let me show you how one and one make three
Listen baby, I'm gonna show you, you gon' see
How one and one equal three
You and me, make L-O-V-E
Nine months later here comes the baby
Now one and one ain't two no more
With a little pitter patter on the hardwood floors
Sunrise to sunset, best bet I ever made
Lemonade in the shade on the back porch talkin'bout our new addition
Home cooked meal on simmer in the kitchen
In a castle of a one room flat, it's us one plus one three
And I think about all we've seen and what this family means
And I think about you and me, about how one and one make three
One and one make three
I be working hard for the chips
Gotta pay the bills, thank God for the gifts
Keep believing
And I'ma keep delivering stack bitcoins
Diversify the dividends
And I think what it takes to grow
This family and give it all I know
Pray to the maker
Pray for the sake of
Me and you and the little one
Let's take a holiday
Let's get away
You and me, baby, and the little one, okay?
I'ma cherish these moments God gave us
Every little second is God's favor
I grow this family
And I think about you and me
About how one and one make three
One and one make three
One and one make three
And I think about you and me
About how one and one make three
One and one make three
One and one make three
One and one make three
One plus one plus love
