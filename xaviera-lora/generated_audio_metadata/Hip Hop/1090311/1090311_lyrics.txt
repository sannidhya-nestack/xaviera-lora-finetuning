Damn, check it out yo, what is that? (See what that nigga got up)
It's like a chariot yo, check it man (Ooooh)
Rams huge, yeah it is, it's like a chariot man
It's my chariot, my carrier, so live I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic, full 12's in the trunk
I got that hump from Murcielago to Veyron to Dunk
This my chariot, my carrier's alive
I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic
Four-twelve's in the tropes
I got the Hulk from Murciélago to Bayron to dope
Corvette ZR1 Camaro SS
Chevy 455 rocking under the hood to leave you a mess
Caddy CTS Boss over 500 horse
Gloss Mags half rag
Gun shaped state tag
Black flag on the hood of a badass
Porsche 911 Carrera
Lotus Esprit Turbo that's Aquarius Blue
Moonroof on the'09 Maxima
Sitting on two-twos
Two-door Chevy Caprice
Classic dump
Four-fifteens, four amps for that hump
Palladium lamps blue on the H2 beats
Tap the gas on the cherry red saline and watch it feast
On Mars, the G's and yo's
Rolls Royce silver goes three whenever I'm grown man rollin'
Impala white like poco, teenagers that holla and smoke
Clutch pop, no choke, yeah nigga my
This my chariot, my carrier, so live, I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic, four-twelves in the trunk
I got the Hulk from Murcielago to Bayron to dump
This my chariot, my carrier, so live I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic, four-twelves in the trunk
I got the Hulk from Murcielago to Bayron to dump
72 Caprice, 74 Chevelle
Big blocks on everything dog can't you tell
8's got it sitting like gas prices high as hell
Insides look like ice cream Carvel
454 y'all don't wanna talk racing
I swear it's passing everything except the gas station
418's got the whole car shaking
From 8 blocks away you feel the ground vibrating
442 black inside with the buttons
Sitting on original rally's dog you see the cutlass
Stick in the flow push start is the button
Electric trunk electric dance don't use the key for nothing
Cold like the winter, that Lambo Inventor
Looking like the Batmobile every time it enter
The new McLaren when they see it, man they cherish it
Looking embarrassing, what got'em sick for Cherries?
What chariot, what carrier, so live I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic, 412's in the trunk
I got that hump from Murcielago to Bayron and Dunk
This my chariot, my carrier's alive
I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic
Four-twelves in the trunk
I got the Hulk from Mercy alive
Or the Bane running, yo
And we'll be killing them
Vehicular homicide riding
I mean, pullin' up inside of a chariot like Kang Farrow (so clean)
See'em starin' from they lil' carriage, they feel embarrassed (they green)
Slide inside a whip so sick, call it paragenic
You get so dizzy from watchin'em burnin' (whoa)
They spinnin' me in a blinded by the glistenin', man listen (whoa)
There ain't no missin' it (whoa) infinite horsepower when shippin' it
Make'em catch a whip
When it whip past you'll think it's fast and furious, serious like that 7 .3 Chevelle SS
With the 454 under they head no less
Candy apple continental with the top chopped off
Got the shame door handles like the locks dropped off
750 BM's, limo 10 KCN, AMG CL Benz
V12 with no rims, they allergic to that murdered out birdie
Standing on thirties with the flow master pipes
That's a rap like a turd in the sweat
My chariot, my carrier so live I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic, 12's in the trunk
I got that hump from Murcielago to Bayron the duck
It's my chariot, my carrier's alive
I'm daring you to get on my level
Iconic, bionic, polyphonic
Four, twelve's in the trunk
I got the hope for mercy alive
Or the Vayron to dump
(dog panting)
