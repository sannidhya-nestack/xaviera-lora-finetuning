I want an encore, bring it back out
Do your thing now, my balls loud
Make me register ten on a Richter scale
No rehearsal, baby plays her part well
She's a natural on the main stage
Watch her all day, then it replay
She's a bestie in every category
Hold it down from beginning to the end of story
Baby lie down, it's a cast couch
I turn the camera on, now bring your best out
You're a winner in the starting roll
Your best angles head to toe
Take one, take two, take three, go
Freeze frame your slide, frame
Take one, take two, take three, go
Freeze frame your slide, frame
Take one, take two, take three, go
Freeze, find me a slide (freeze)
Freeze, find me a slide (go, freeze)
Freeze, find me a slide (challenge)
Come here baby, give me some more
Come here baby, give me some more
Now make baby give me some more
Now make baby give me some more
It's show time
Give me your best shot
It's a sex scene
Make it real hot
Toss her hair back
Dug in her nails
Now my walls got holes
From the bed post
She's a dream girl
Prim time slot
Do a solo
Then a group shot
Her ass is automatic
She makes a blind man stop and stare
Take one take two take three go
Breeze Prime Air Slide (frame)
Take one, take two, take three (go) (frame)
Breeze Prime Air Slide (shake it)
Take one, take two, take three (go!)
Breeze Prime Air Slide (frame)
Breeze Prime Air Slide (go) (frame)
Breeze Prime Air Slide (shake it)
Come make baby give me some more
Come make baby give me some more
Come make baby give me some more
Come make baby give me some more
Do you encore
Encore, do you encore
Encore, do you encore
Encore, do you encore
Encore, standing ovations
Encore, standing ovations
Encore
Take one, take two, take three (go)
Please find me a slide (frame)
Take one, take two, take three (go, frame)
Please find me a slide (frame)
Take one, take two, take three (go),
Please find me a slide (frame)
Please find me a slide (go, frame)
Please find me a slide (frame)
Come here baby give me some more
Come here baby give me some more
Come here baby, give me some more
Come here baby, give me some more
Come here baby, give me some more
Give me some more
Come here baby, give me some more
Give me some more
