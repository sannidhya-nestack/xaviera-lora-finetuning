Just push it, oh girl, just push it
Just push it, just push it, yeah, ah yeah
I'm fresh, I'm fly, now what you expect?
My crew get love and we all on deck
Love Sunday through Thursday but ain't nothing like a
Friday, Friday
Tank full of gas, pockets got cash
Just got paid to the club, we gon' mash
Stop by the spot to get the gear correct
Cause they bound to be a bunch of bum dips to collect
Swooped up the homie and I'm on my way
It ain't no question, it's more on the way
Southern cow style, weekend delight
A pumpin' world party and it's on tonight
Keep the bang bang, no need to fight
Check the drama and the problems at the door, alright
The kid ain't the one and you know the deal
So just do what you feel if what you feel is real
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And no there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And no there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
DJ's spinning digging in the crates
An opportunity for memories I plan to create
Y'all know the Steve so snap a neck
Cause I'ma bring you the real kill the special effects
You got the BBD poison a butt and a smile
Digging your style what's the number to dial
Johnny T's the name and I'ma spell it out
By the end of the night you gon' yell it out
Love, I'm not foolin' myself, I got three words for ya, you're foolin' yourself
If you think for a second what I got ain't strong
I got the line of Richie Levin for ya all night long
Fight the feelin', why even bother? Your girlfriend's hot and my boy wanna holla
You and me and he and she and maybe you and me and her make three
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night (Ain't no, there ain't no doubt about it)
It's going down
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And you know there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
Ooh, oh-oh
Going down
Ooh, oh-oh
It's going down
The nightclub flirter and the skirt worker
Hit her on the cell or maybe I'll chirp her
Dudes prepaid on the VIP
COD but girl I need the CID
15'll get you 20 if you don't look 30
The rules of the game and the game's kinda dirty
Plenty of latex no need to worry
That HIV will kill ya
Off in a hurry, kids play it safe cause it's really wicked
Chicks bite a click, you ain't gotta stick it
Do what you feel, if the vibe ain't wrong
And maybe we can do this all night long
Cause you lookin' sexy baby and tonight it's goin' down
So we can chop it up because that booty's nice and round
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And no there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And no there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
Friday, Friday, Friday night
And no there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
It's Friday, Friday, Friday night
And though there ain't no doubt about it
It's going down
Going down
