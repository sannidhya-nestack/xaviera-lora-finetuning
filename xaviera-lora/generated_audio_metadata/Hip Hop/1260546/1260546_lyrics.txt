And I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna cry
I trust you when I'm at my weakest
I was out to steal the streets
I'm having trouble with my mind
Still seeing things I'm running back
I'm happy when they're sad
But next to woozy like someone who slept
All I want is my real money
Henry gives it to me honey
Am I going back, same place
Am I going back, same place
Am I going back, yeah
Ooh, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la
And I'm going back
And I'm going back
And I'm going back
This issue's on my heart
It's my contempt I never lost
Can I trust you with my life?
Got this tension, is it not?
Do I love you? I don't know
My feelings, have they show a wound?
All I need is trust and love
Can you give me room? That's all
And I'm going back
And I'm going back
And I'm going back
Safe haven, am I born to find?
Safe haven, I really wanna find
Safe haven, to keep me warm at night
Am I born to find?
Safe haven
Yeah, I, say that
