Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you only knew what you mean to me
If you only knew, if you only knew
Before we knew it we'd been falling through
We've fallen through, we've fallen through
To a place with no return
You're the one that I prefer
My favorite, far from basic
You know it's vital for me to know if you're safe
when you leave my side
I'm staring at the time, till
I'll see you again
Girl let's not pretend
That we could just stay friends
Just friends
Way more than that
I wanna be the one you confide in
Spilling all your secrets
Tainted with the paint that covers your skin
Cherishing our space
And I'll never leave, I'll never leave this place
You won't have to beg me, you'll never beg me to stay
To stay with you
If you only knew what you mean to me
You would just see
The clarity of my purity
If you only knew
You would just see
The clarity of mine
It's so satisfying
What perfect timing
When both our eyes meet
It feels so enticing
You purify me
In the air that I breathe
In our sanctuary
Is where I wanna be, I wanna be (I can't find no one like you)
Wish I could multiply you
And take a double shot of you
They sure don't breed'em like you
You say I'm intense (I know)
A little too much (I know)
But I just want you to know
The type of man I am
I'm a pure, pure man (oh yeah)
The only way I can
I'm just a man (a pure, pure man)
A pure, pure man
A simple man
If you only knew what you mean to me
You would just see
The clarity of my purity
