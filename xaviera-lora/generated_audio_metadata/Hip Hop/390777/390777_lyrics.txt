Yo, check it out now, yo, yo
Ayo, your flow sounds old when you spit
It's like you had spider webs on your hand when you roast
I roast your hits, toast your shit to make you harder
Smoke a spliff and let you live,'cause I'm a martyr
The fire starter is verbal slaughter
Underwater, I'm seducing mermaids
After freeing slaves on the martyr
Without a swallow, I can spit a knife
Through your heart and scar ya
Pull your skirt up and call you a bitch in front of your father
So why you lockin all your car doors
Think it's goin to rob you
Take your jewels for shiny chrome revolvers
The heart room
It's all in your eyes I follow
All between your wife dies
Slicin her pie and pop her
You can't stop her
Real nigga who live with the cause
It's like a pen not pen
Cause he got crabs on his balls, they clap with applause
Every time I rap on the mic, ripping insight
Through your brain don't care if you like it or not
You might get shot on the spot, you out on the spot
Bloody ass the infrared dot
It's like he's on some Battle For Props
Tackling drops, snatching your throat
Watch your neck snap, crackle and pop
Yo snap, crackle and pop
Call me son because I'm too hot
Grab your knee and spit around for your pops
Bring your venom to a war in Battle For Props
Battle with clocks or squeeze until the temperature drops
Yo snap crackle and pop
Call me son because I'm too hot
Rock your heat and spit around for your blocks
Bring your venom to a war and battle for props
Battle with clocks I'll squeeze until the temperature drops
Bust at the cock
I laugh like my name is Tupac
Shine like rocks
It's diamond cut with niggas in plot
Put your hands up get ready to box
Look at the clock I'm punching your stomach
Until I hit the rim with your fart
Close caskets I'm flipping birds up out of flocks
Leaving ashes so I burn your corpse and leave you in socks
Dropkick your mother in a ditch and fall on my pits
Throw pig blood on her breasts and pinch they neck sick
Come reckless like a shotgun necklace
Demon infested with Jesus Christ's resurrection
Cut your hands off and count your blessings
Teach you lessons, beat you with weapons
Cause it ain't no half-stepping
This rap profession is Smith and Wesson's text
In Desert Eagle, Vets and Deadly Sequels
So what about your people?
When I spit at your crew
Will it eat you? Will I defeat you?
Or will you counteract lethal?
Throw your metaphors in biblical speech like Hebrews
Only to become squashed by the soul of my ten boots
Never sleep in disputes and the last truth
The same that you roll with could paralyze you
Take your lyco to your funeral and hug your mom deuce
Make a toast to your memory and hustle your loot
Take your lyco to your funeral and hug your mom deuce
Make a toast to your memory, I'm hustlin' your new
Yo, snap, crackle, and pop
On the sun because I'm too hot
Rockin' heat and spit around for your pops
Bring your venom to a war and battle for props
Battle with glocks, I'll squeeze until the temperature drops
Yo, snap, crackle, and pop
On the sun because I'm too hot
Rockin' heat and spit around for your pops
Bring your venom to a war and battle for props
Battle with glocks, I'll squeeze until the temperature drops, yeah
Like Charles
Australia production
Tyree gets deep
Yeah yeah
I'm into rappers
North Cat
Where the guns blast
Where you rest at
Put your head up
Put your L's up
Yeah
It's like that
