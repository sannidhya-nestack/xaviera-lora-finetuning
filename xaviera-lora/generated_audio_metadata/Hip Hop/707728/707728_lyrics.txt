I don't know what I'm doing!
I swear you look so good
You stay right across the street
And you got a man who always keep you in the crib cause he wanna leave
I've been peeping you
Out for a long time
If you ever mess up I wanna be the first in line
I stay G'd up
And I know you peep that
Gotta keep the whip clean and plus I'm counting big racks
I gotta crush on you
And I know you got one on me
Cause I always catch you always looking at me all crazy
If you can get some time
I would like for you to come through
So we can kick it maybe smoke cause I wanna talk to you
There he goes again
You're tripping cause he left you in the crib
It's the same old thing and plus he even started an argument
Now you're on my couch
Let me offer you a shot
I could be your shoulder girl if that's all you want us to talk
All about your problems
I could try to help you solve'em (solve'em)
The next thing you know (know)
All of your clothes is comin' off now (now I'm hittin' your spot)
I'm hittin' your spot
I'm hittin' your spot
I'm hittin' your spot
Now I'm hittin' your spot

I'm hitting your spot
Now I'm hitting your spot
I'm hitting your spot
I'm hitting your spot
Now I'm hitting your spot
Now I'm hitting your spot
That's what you said to me
If hitting your spot was a crime
Then I'd be committing a felony
But it felt so good
That I hope I can get it again
I could be your secret admirer, girl, your homie love friend
You must've told your girl
Because she be looking at me
Like she wanna introduce herself or maybe she want some of me
But I'm stuck on you
I'm really tryna get a little more
Cause you got me hooked like that first hit like it's some good dough
If you can give some time
I would like for you to come through
So we can kick it there's so many things I wanna do to you
There he goes again
But you ain't trippin' cause he left you in the crib
It's the same old thing but this time girl you started that argument
Now you on my couch
This time you brought your friend
The conversation's getting heated while we sipping up on these drinks
Fire up that loud
And I said skip all this small talk
