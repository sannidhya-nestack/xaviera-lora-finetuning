Pa-di-ya-da
Pa-di-ya-da-ta-tata
Oh yeah
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
For the very first time that I ever laid my dreamy eyes on you
Thought that I was touched by an angel straight from heaven
Sent for seven up but the way it is
Better caught up in your suntime
Thought I would've always been yours and you would've always been mine
I never did ever thought I'd have this feeling in my life
Let's hang out around with the fellas feelings with you twice as nice
Caught up with the raps just see you was my sugar and my spice
If ever there was darkness up in my life you shed some light
Down for the ways of me and mine
Saturday in heavenly bliss, honey coated candy drop
Caught up in the mix with just a kiss, soft and silky like the breast of a dove
But the way I feel for you, better recognize this true love
Never to hold back my feelings, better reckon I always kept it true for you
Now sit upon this here earth that I would have never do for you
Do for me love a friend, down to the end, so soft, so fine if lovely was a crime
Know that I would do my time, I get old love, you are my sunshine
You are my sunshine
You are my world (All I need in my life, in my life is my sunshine)
You're everything that dreams are made of
You are the iron in my will
Somebody talks with you every moment while wishing upon a star
No matter where you are you would've been deep inside of my heart
Straight love with the way you go with the flow of life like crazy
Cool forever my treasure no wealth could've measured to my jewels
I drew so many memories believe in me my sweet serenity
Sweet and tenderly I would've always loved you endlessly
Just somebody to call my own someone for me to hold on to
Someone true to be known someone for me to belong to
Caressed and whole our soul grace set upon your warm embrace
Somebody ups and downs in my life you always taught me to keep the faith
Steady reminiscing about the days of love, nights of intimate passion
No second of thought that will it last like some sort of a passion
Ain't no telling where the way it goes, when in the city of sin
Fantasizing about you daily checking in and when when when
Homie love a friend down for the ways I thought divine if lovely was a crime
No doubt I would do my time I ghetto love you are my sunshine
You are my sunshine
You are my world (all I need in my life in my life is my sunshine)
You're everything that dreams are made of
You are the iron in my will
You better believe you're everything in this world that I could've ever dreamed of
Mind to go along with the body like a goddess of love
Nothing more precious, sacred, and cherished than up on this earth
To me, with the way I feel for you'til I'm set in the dirt
Never to be simpin', but if I wear this baby doll just for the way I feel
What's wrong with a brother sayin' how it is to keep it real?
Know what I mean? Just you and me, and the birds and bees
So simple, had to run through threes, had to ABC's
Not know where the fuck was goin' down before my very eyes
Called out for the mix with a product for the most that I despise
Stinking up what went wrong, why'd I do so? Said to be stressing
Not knowing if I won't moment, wanna be caught in deception
How could you do me like that? Popping away so friend to me
How could you do me like that? You were the only one I need
See ain't no telling by the way it goes
Heart broke for the fact your mind thought you was
But you ain't, never to be tripping but blinded by the sunshine
You are my sunshine
You are my world
You're everything that dreams are made of
You are the iron in my wheel, yeah
You are my sunshine, babe
You're everything I need, please babe
