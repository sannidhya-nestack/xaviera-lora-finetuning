Day or night, let's start from the beat in your heart
Feel the rhythm, let's go, move your feet to the flow
Life's action so intense, the rhythm that lifts us up again
Hands up, reach in the sky, time to live, we can fly
Bring it together, feel it now forever
This tonight's us all, never gonna fall
Every voice, one sound
Echoes linger to the unity we found
Let's lift it off the ground
Laughter, joy, we share, dance without a care
Come on, feel the beat, take it to the street
Bring it together, feel it now forever
Beacon lights us all, never gonna fall
Day and night, let's start from the beat in your heart
Feel the rhythm, let's go, move your feet to the flow
Lights flashing so intense, to rhythm that lift us up again
Hands up, reach in the sky, time to live, weaken the fly
Bring it together, feel it now forever
Beat unites us all, never gonna fall
Then we voiced one sound
Echoes, finger to the unity we found
The sister off the ground
Last of joy we shared dance without a care
Come on, feel the beat take it to the street
Bring it together, feel it now forever
Be united so I'm never gonna fall
