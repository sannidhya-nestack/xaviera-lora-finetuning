Uh, it's GND, all day, DC nights, mornings in South Beach
Lam hini doors up, yeah, for everybody living the life
Uh, yeah, uh
We be having crazy wild threesomes
Me and she, she and her, she and me, she and she
See us three, we a blur, we don't curve, we do us
Video can't watch, we do us, sleep on fur, dream on lust
Money and fame was a dream for us
Got my deal, now what's real? What does it all really mean for us?
Sex and power, sex and showers, sex and powder, sex for hours
Private jets, public life, feel so wrong but I fucked her right
I'm a role model buying four models and it feels so strange to discuss my life
Look where I came from, you would do the same son
Bet if you could live my life you would trade her
What you wish for ain't what I live for
She ain't nothing but a diamond on my wrist, whore
Uh, but I love it though, took a little taste and I wanted more
Put it in her box and she hollered score
Powder on her face with a dollar straw
Never did I think I'd lose control
Girl you just too beautiful
Lam hini cruising slow
She feel so unusual
Never did I think I'd fly so high
Feeling like I could touch the sky
Knew that you were trouble
I made you sing my lullaby
Never did I think I'd lose control
Girl you just too beautiful
Lam hini cruising slow
She feel so unusual
Never did I think I'd fly so high
Feeling like I could touch the sky
Knew that you were trouble
I made you sing my lullaby
Money on my mind, money all the time
Stacks on her, that's money on a dime
I'm on top but I feel so low
So I go somewhere where it's sunny all the time
All is cash, all is ass, A1A Collins Ave
Can it be that it was all so simple
Till I put tens on all my windows
Saw that car said I cop it
One day get a couture that's project runway
Backs on stacks and I'm losing my vision
Racks on racks losing my religion
Who am I kidding we in Dubai
Chicks so sick and my whip so fly
Chicks so thick and my dick so wide
Can't fit it all in bitch just try
It's just I want our music
Most motherfuckers never thought I'd do it
Silly motherfucker I swear I'd do it
Scarface life of course I knew it
See me with that bad bitch
Me and her girlfriend make a sandwich
Meditation when the morning come
Is it worth all of this madness
I love'em, treat'em, don't deceive'em
But I don't trust or need'em
Get to cars, get to broads
Call my clique and discuss the weekend
Top down, we on the block
When it's hot she gotta top down
Ready to spark, we don't stop
Never did I think I'd lose control
Girl you just too beautiful
Lam hini cruising slow
She feel so unusual
Never did I think I'd fly so high
Feeling like I could touch the sky
Knew that you were trouble
I made you sing my lullaby
Never did I think I'd lose control
Girl you just too beautiful
Lam hini cruising slow
She feel so unusual
Never did I think I'd fly so high
Feeling like I could touch the sky
Knew that you were trouble
I made you sing my lullaby
GND and the IMMO all is cash that I slide to my kinfolk
Looking at the stars from the side of my window
You wouldn't believe all the things I've been through
GND and the IMMO all is cash that I slide to my kinfolk
