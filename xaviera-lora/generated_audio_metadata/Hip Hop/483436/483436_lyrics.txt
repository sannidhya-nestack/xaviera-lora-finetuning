So much to say and so little time
I wonder what type of impact I make with the rhymes
And beats blended in
I guess only time will tell
Cause that's the true test from all the rest
I've been blessed to witness some of the best
As well as the bad times
Authentic the fad times
And through it all it remains raw from the heart
Sharp as a dart never torn apart
Cause hip hop means a lot but no question
You get lost the music will show you direction
Connecting the young to old old to the young
Man woman and child the profile
Could take all shapes and forms
Whatever your choice is
Different sound shapes and voices combine together
They never thought it would last this long
But the song would last forever
Ever it don't stop
You won't block the goals, we got a lot of those
Ever since back then, been rockin' the shows
That's the way it's gon' have to be'til the curtains close (close)
Yo, it don't stop
You won't block the goals, we got a lot of those
Ever since back then, been rockin' the shows
That's the way it's gon' have to be'til the curtains close (close)
Sitting here with the pad and pen begin
The composition without opposition you listen
Been here for years now here's how
Blessing your ears all throughout making the crowd shout
Who in the house the basement they can never erase the placement
No time for wasting from sunny days to rough
Fat pockets to notebooks still got the dope rhymes and cuts to blend
Positive and negative trends whatever your choice is
Different sound shapes and voices combine together
They never thought it would last this long
But the song would last forever
Yo it don't stop
You won't block the goals
We got a lot of those
Ever since back then
Been rocking the shows
That's the way it's gonna have to be
Till the curtains close
Yo it don't stop
You won't block the goals, we got a lot of those
Ever since back then, been rockin' the shows
That's the way it's gon' have to be'til the curtains close
It don't stop, you won't block the goals
We got a lot of those, ever since back then
Been rockin' the shows, that's the way it's gon' have to be
Till the curtains close (close)
Yo, it don't stop, you won't block the goals
We got a lot of those, ever since back then
Been rockin' the shows, that's the way it's gon' have to be
Till the curtains close (close)
It don't stop
You won't block the goals, we got a lot of those
Ever since back then, been rockin' the shows
That's the way it's gon' have to be'til the curtains close (close)
Yo, it don't stop
You won't block the goals, we got a lot of those
Ever since back then, been rockin' the shows
That's the way it's gon' have to be'til the curtains close
It don't stop
It don't stop
It don't stop
