It's now the first light of day
My senses open wide
Emotions running deep
From them I do not hide
Wings lifting from this earth
I'm soaring through the skies
I gently kiss your lips
I cannot fathom why
You taught me how to play
In such a loving way
The rise and swim of this earth
I see the light of day
I'm learning to see goodness
I'm learning how to play
I've learned to be aware
I've learned to live my day without tragedy and loss
But with dignity and grace
I'm longing for your touch
The feel of your embrace
I've now seen the light
It's filled my soul with hope
You've given me new confidence, you've shown me the way
You're showing it's alright, you're showing it's okay
My heart is filled with joy, my heart is filled with pride
The tears they start to flow, the tears they find their way
Sometimes I think they know, how long they'll last today
Each one a precious gift, that gives a special lift
That takes me on my way, to love you more each day
I'm drifting through the dreams, I'm soaring to your heart
My loving knows no bounds, my love is here to stay
The love we thought we lost
The love that went away, it's here right now
It's right here today, it's never gonna wait
It's always in your heart, it's always in your soul
Forever I will know, the fire's not gone
The fire's not out, it's molded in our hearts
Showing us the way, our souls they swim together
They never lost their way, our mortal selves too thin
They do it everyday but our spotless souls
There are angels in the sky
They show the love they bring in surprising hidden ways
Here comes one now and she's whispering your name
I hear it clear as day
I hear it every day
I love your heart my dear
I long for it to stay
The love I feel for you will never go away
I cry for you right now
My tears are rolling thick
They're dripping to my chest like daggers stabbing deep
I've learned to live with pain
The pain of you's still going
I long for times gone by
The magic of your soul
The bond we felt so well
The bond we felt so well
I'll always be your man, you'll always be my girl
The winds blow us apart, we'll always have those times
If only in our minds
It's better to have love and lost our love for found
Than never to have seen how tensely what we found
They threw us far too close, they scrambled us around
Like fires in the night, our flames kept burning bright
They tickled and so light, they tickled to new heights
The angels fly around, the wings of a dying gold
They comfort us through storms with such a special bond
I've never seen an angel that have opened up my mind
Or should I say my soul, I see them all around
Everywhere I go, their loving hearts are bright
I see them in the sky, I see them in the night
They're calling out your name without the slightest shame
They're calling me to you without the slightest pain
They're loving and they're good, they tell me what I should
Do to earn your love, absorbing all your pain
But it's not about me, it's you and selfless too
How did we stray so far?
Tell me what to do if I could take away your pain
Move it to my heart, I do it everyday
Especially in the dark, download it to my heart
Download it to my heart
Enough of dreams right now
To the earth I must return
Reality is harsh but serves its purpose well
For without negativity how could we feel the joy
The contrast it creates
That shows us fighting wrong
That shows us love and hate
That teaches us to dream and not to relegate
Our lives into the dark
For in the light we see
For in the light we play
For in the light we give
For in the light we pray
I'll be a better man for having loved your soul
I'll fight the demons off
My angel he's so close he's showing me the way
To stay inside the light to never stray again
The darkness I've seen I've followed in its spell
But now it's in the past I've conquered it so well
And so I dedicate my lifetime from now on
To stay within the light to stay within the light
Within the light I'll stay and love you more each day
Within the light I'll stay and love you more each day
And love you more each day
