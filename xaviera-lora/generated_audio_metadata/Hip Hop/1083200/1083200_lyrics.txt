Yeah, uh.
Yeah I'm Jumpman floating over all of them obstacles I was made for this
Nothing is impossible they pass me the rock cause I stay on top
Switch nothing but neck that's a game when it's shot
Surrounded by those who keep me humble never give up
Get back up when I stumble when I slip up
No sky no limit no cap to my altitude
It's more than a game it's an attitude
I'm the vision I'm the fighter
I'm the lion the survivor
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah you know I am, oh oh oh
Yeah you know I am, oh oh oh
I'm the vision, I'm the fire
I'm the lion, the survivor
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah you know I am
I'm lightning in the cloud and I'm about to strike (yeah)
Three points, half court, never on the side
Don't walk anymore, I either float or fly
They say I'm pretty beast mode for a nice guy
So fresh, so hype, so fly, so clean
You'll never kill as hard to beats inside of me, nah
I'm the vision, I'm the fighter
I'm the lion, the survivor
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah, you know I am
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, you know I am
Oh, oh, oh
I'm the vision
I'm the fire
I'm the lion
The survivor
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah, you know I am
Oh, oh, oh
Bring it on, let's go
Bring it on, let's go
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah, you know I am
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah you know I am
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah you know I am
Oh oh oh
Yeah you know I am
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah you know I am
I'm the last one left to stand
Yeah you know I am
