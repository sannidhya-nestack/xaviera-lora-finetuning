Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
I should get a plaque in my city
For never being whack while I spit these words
I'm traveling through time, I'm redesigning your verse
Reconnecting your hook, let's realign your nerves
Soul search the crates, ship'em across states
Till they reach they destiny next to me
It's on a turntable spin cycle
I ain't started making beats before I been nitro
Ain't no fly by night flow
Man I use outer orbit voices every time I broadcast
Hard hat visit, I put your wax in the construction
While I'm improving the form of structure
I get a piece of paper, write that
And then I find a melody, put a bass line beside that
Focus eyes at, play record sync
Man this is hotter than you think
Rhymes
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Beeps
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man, I'm just bringing them back
Man, I'm just bringing them back (hip-hop)
Oh, man, I'm just bringing them back (let's go)
Man, I'm just bringing them back
Shame on a coward who devoured good air time
Four minutes of dead air
Really wasn't no skills there (nope)
Ten albums still here (like it)
World position plus making the moves is the mission
But times change like days and moving minutes
My headphones wrapped on vocal pitch
Shifting in it isn't real pinching
Wallets throbbing from the low end
Friends came out the sewer when I blew up
I threw the firewood to walk
See my kinetic crew is up, we heavy zingers
And we so deadly with the flow, dead ringer for a pro
Each time you gonna blow blow, but of course I'm nice with the flow
Flawless when I go, see my jaw's mechanical
So I keep it tight and when I'm writing so the speakers I won't bite in
And leave marks like my logo, feel the vibe like vinyl, get it?
Rhymes
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Beeps
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Stop, man I'm just bringing them back, man I'm just bringing them back
Hip Hop, man I'm just bringing them back, man i'm just bringing them back
You see I speak with a southern drawl
When I brawl there are no rules
Competing the hottest heat with no shoes
Those dudes got ahead of the line standing
I'm ahead of my time gambling
Placing these chips and scanning
I'm seeing who's really down for the dude
Who in this do lose who's really coming through
I'm so sick and tired man I'm so tired of you
And rap fake persona stop pretending you're cool
Go back to the lab mend your wounds
My mood changes like a ring with deeper hues
You better up grace around and get some deeper dudes
Yeah I peached your mood my lyrics leaked in ooze
Over data diss I make the rap to split after this
Get the camera flashing click see I sprinkle the streets
Like confetti from my loose leaf
T double watch me come in freak beats
Yeah, Runs, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Beats, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Stop, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Hip Hop, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Runs, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Beats, man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back
Man I'm just bringing them back, man I'm just bringing them back (hip hop)
Man I'm just bringing them back, man I just bringing them back
