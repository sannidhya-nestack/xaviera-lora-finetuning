You can't lie to it, can't hide from it all up in your face
Sometimes you can't take it, so I embrace it
Walk with your spirit now, cause I know you're there
And you smile when you hear it now, coming clearer now
I see the blueprint and use it, I went from a pawn to the king
So I laugh at the world that we living in
Cause the battle is way beyond us giving in
It's a sickening fact that we're blind and confide
In the truth of your own mentality
What you gonna do man what you gonna do
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue tied
Nowhere to go seeing you struggle with tough times
What you gonna do man what you gonna do
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue tied
Nowhere to go seeing you struggle with tough times
Corner crashing life flashing what you got sitting in
Contemplating situations at a dead end
My friend you the route no doubt
Another lesson learned another one burned down
But not doubt time to see what you're about
Consequence for every action
Making for you satisfaction
Earth just a part of the fraction
Energy of mind eternity of time
Walking the line with my thoughts divine
What you gonna do, man, what you gonna do?
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue-tied
Nowhere to go, said you struggle with tough times
What you gonna do, man, what you gonna do?
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue-tied
Nowhere to go, said you struggle with tough times
I remember the first time I said hello to my conscience
Time had surely told it was quite fucking obvious
It's far-raising interludes of criminal endeavors
With no long effect into my schedule
Life's short road turned at its own discretion
United we stand with all its imperfections
Rain, sleep, crime to win time
The nitty-gritty's so hard to maintain
Find time to get with it
Pinned in paper, playing the caper
Yo, it's not in vain
A long night, sweating tears as I grip the game
Pass the haters, pass the pusher to my chosen
I verbalize, articulate with my gift of gab
While stress grows and flows'til it controls my veins
I realize and understand that life ain't the same
So concentrate, deliberate, and take life real slow
I make no hasty conclusions before you know
Well everything comes to he who hustles while he waits
Choose your fate, lose your hate, eliminate all the fake
Perpetrators, haters that bring you down low
It's the wake up call, we here to say hello
So whatchu gonna do? Man whatchu gonna do?
What you gonna do when reality comes crashing down on you?
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue-tied
Nowhere to go seeing you struggle with tough times
What you gonna do, man, what you gonna do when reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue-tied
Nowhere to go
Seein' you struggle with tough times
Prepared ability mentally
A microphone philosophy
Transmittin' psychologically
Claimin' physical properties
On any opportunity
Microphone my college degree
Still not guaranteed
Motivated to proceed
More of a release than a greed
Not a want, a need
For thoughts I bleed
Manifest until conceived
See what's scopin'
Meditation, preparation
For the title you're hopin'
What you gonna do?
Man, what you gonna do?
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you
And leaves your tongue tied
Nowhere to go
Seein' you struggle with tough times
What you gonna do, man, what you gonna do?
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue-tied
Nowhere to go, seeing you struggle with tough times
Jealousy, hate eliminates the competition
Opposition never wrote stronger words in the composition
But now I'm cutting loose, stuck with proof that this world really ain't shit
Believe it, know it may take time to see it
But open your mind and the truth can be yours
Not everyone is ready for the half of it
So I'm taking it slow and easy when I'm asking it
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue tied
Know where to go seeing you struggle with tough times
What you gonna do, man what you gonna do
When reality comes crashing down on you
Comes around on you and leaves you tongue tied
Know where to go seeing you struggle with tough times
