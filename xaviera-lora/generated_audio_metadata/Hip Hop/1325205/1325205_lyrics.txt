Digits print while on the midnight thread
Laugh pack crew in a side chat spread
Click after click stacking jokes on stack
Turning quiet screens into feedback crack
We trade memes quicker than a caffeine drip
Every buzz landing like a championship
No gold trophy yet the brag feels sweet
Scroll wheel spins till we own that feed
Sync that count four taps lock the line
Words link tight charging through the timeline
Hold for the drop then flood the grid
When the clock hits go we do what we did
Swipe swipe
Feel the surge inside, hands up high, we're certified
Swipe, swipe, win, let the good vibes spin
Locked in together, we swipe to win
Binary confetti when the milestone pops
We stack high scores while the small talk drops
Side quest heroes with a budget of memes
Turning playing weekends into champion streams
Doubt logs in but we mute that noise
Patch after patch we refine our poise
Any naysayer glitch gets cleared in a sec
Update rolled out now watch the deck
Hold tight, countdown's near
Bold flow, pulling us clear
One more swipe, walls give way
Wheel of glory, press save your day
Swipey swipe win, feel the surge inside
Hands up high, we're certified
Swipey swipe win, let the good vibes spin
Locked in together, we swipe to win
