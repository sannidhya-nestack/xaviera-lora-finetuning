I remember who I was
I'm not going back where I started from
Don't look back, I'm gone
Ghost, ghost, ghost
I remember who I was
I'm not going back where I started from
Don't look back, I'm gone
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Light up, if you understand it
Light up, you feel where I'm coming from
From
Light up, if you understand it
Light up, you'll feel where I'm coming from
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Turn my microphone up, this hip hop for the grown ups
Diagnosed bipolar, word to the soul controller
It don't matter, mind over matter
Cause I'ma beat this, peep this, to each his own
You in the bleachers, me I'm on the field
You feel me, running them yards boy
Word to God boy, Satan cannot beat the yard boy
Me odd boy, it don't matter where I been
Vicin I'm in, skin I'm in, proud of that
My past, I ain't going back
My mind, sometimes, feels like a battlefield
War torn, yeah, it's a war going on
Inside my brain cells, psychologist tells me I need to see a psych
This what mental illness look like (I remember who I was)
(I'm not going back where I started from)
(Don't look back, I'm gone)
Coast, coast, coast
I remember who I was
I'm not going back where I started from
Don't look back, I'm gone
Coast, coast, coast
Light up if you understand it
Light up if you feel where I'm coming from
From
Light up, if you understand it
Light up, you'll feel where I'm coming from
Ah-ah
Can you get this?
Got to prioritize mental fitness
My peoples are suffering
No Tylenol, no buffering
Can fix the fix we in
This awful mix we in
Got the whole community mixed up
Me, I picked up on what I was advised
Opened my eyes, took notes
Nightly down my throat
Swallowed two double coats
To get myself about this funk
Rid my thoughts of the gunk
Some self-medicate to the detriment of they fate
Stand up, recognize yourself
Realize yourself, bipolar and mental illness don't mean you ain't a prize yourself
Sure as I stand here before you, I can assure you
Once you take that first step, you made the right move (yep)
I remember who I was, I'm not going back where I started from
Don't look back, I'm gone
Ghost, ghost, ghost
I remember who I was
I'm not going back where I started from
Don't look back, I'm gone
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Light up if you understand it
Light up if you're where I'm coming from
From
Light up, if you understand it
Light up, you'll feel where I'm coming from
Light up, if you understand it
Light up, you'll feel where I'm coming from, from
