When the sky outside is darkening And you're searching for the light
You hesitate to light that candle that you hold
So afraid you might get burned
But you don't have to be a guardian angel
You hold your wings so close to you, you've otten how to fly
And as for me, I can only dream
That you could learn to love me
Put your trust in me baby
Oh put your trust in me baby
I know you're feeling tired and lonely
And on love you closed the door
But can't you see just how wonderful this could be
If you'd only let me in
But you don't have to be a guardian angel
You hold your wings so close to you
You've otten how to fly
And as for me, I can only dream
That you could learn to love me
Put your trust in me baby
I know that sometimes love can hurt you
Too many hearts that can't be broken
Too many times too many words are often spoken
Where intentions didn't lie
But you don't have to be a guardian angel
You hold your wings so close to you
You've otten how to fly
And as for me, I can only dream
That you could learn to love me
Would you trust in me baby?
Put your trust in me baby
I'll put your trust in me baby
I'll show you how
