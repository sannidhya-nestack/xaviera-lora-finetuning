Oh, man
What's up, man?
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
Yo, what you singing, man?
It's a new hectic song, baby
Who's hectic?
You mean you never heard of hectic?
Oh, what's he -<|13.16|>
So fly, la-da-da-da
Oh, Nana, no Osama
Go bananas, oh, Zuzana
I keep that sticky-icky
Smokey, smokey, okie-dokie
I spit that killy-willy
Illy-skilly, hit the filly
I get the latest baby, I just like the birdie birdie
My alien hurts your feelings, stuff your face like turkey fillin'
I'm from, from Harlem, from the bottom to the top son
I got a big fat pot of potter, fuck some smoking lotter
Owe your owner forty five a dollar, holla
Whoah, he's hot
In the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, watch him chick, he's a pimp, he's a pimp, but I just him to join, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point, that's the point
My pants are saggy, faggy
Haters cry like satin waddies
Don't date me, no don't date me
Most y'all chicks be flaky shaky
Mojitas, oh but Jesus
So damn broke I just got beepers
Don't know me, listen homie
This is what they call me
Ooh woah, he so fly
He's that guy, he's that guy
Ooh woah, he so hot
In the sky, in the sky
Ooh woah, watch your cheek
That's him to join, that's the point, that's the point
Hey yo, fast dragon, ten at a time packing
Go ahead papi, jump in the bandwagon
Sad ain't it, look he done made it
Hooked on the guns ain't he, croak on the run crazy
I never had no cash before, flash before
Never had a rash before, before
Fat bitches never done a bash before
But now I'm back for more,'bout to attack these hoes
Hey, take a bigger giga, give me some money
I wanna say I'm happy but I'm not, give me your wallet
Sorry buddy I don't care for honey's dunny
You just a big fat dummy
Nickelodeon flow stay away
Gumby or crummy sunny you better run from me
Lil Hector the chicken dresser
The pin finesser dope protector
Hawkeye time macheta
You guess a krypton blesser
Oh oh he so fly he's a god he's a god
Oh oh he so hot in the sky in the sky
Oh oh watch your cheek he
Master Point, Master Point, happy
