Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Camino fuerte, camino con mala suerte
Y después tú vas a ver que vas a ser más fuerte
Desde ese wey, ocho años en la cárcel
Y a tus enemigos, tú no seas cancer
No te dejes tapo culo porque pienso que eres duro
En estilo al Pacino, al Pacino, al Pacino
This is your way, en español es tu camino
Así que ponte duro porque tú eres mi amigo
La chino bomb y un rico bullets y se pino
Los pensamientos de nosotros van contigo
Andando por la calle con locados mi amigo
Riendo de los tiempos de chalado mi amigo
Recordando sufrimientos viejos tiempos escarmientos
Orale
Recordando sufrimientos viejos tiempos escarmientos
Now check it out (check it out)
Livin' that fast life
No money can stop this man
P sellin' keys at the lowest for a hundred grand
Come in with that right neighbor
It won't save ya
Sniff that through ya nose and now you're frozen by the flame
Givin' props and to my niggas doin' time
Stay strong it won't be long until you're doin' fine
The nine inclines on the street they're doin' crime
Too many homicides the blood was the first sign
On the real with the steel cap spiel
Taking life from a sucker who thought he had mass appeal
Two times dope, the hope of the coke
That's rap brothers that took it as a motherfuckin' joke (work)
My name is Capito after all the double E
U-N-D-E-R-S-T-E-N-D-I-N-G-P-E-A-C-E
I'm from P-O-U-D-H-K double E-P-S-I-E
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, god damn, I'm stuck
Cooking and violence, a life to live
For brothers rolling lockdown, surpass another man's rig
It's going deep like steep amongst the wrong edge
Racing shark panic and crack to kill another head
You gonna shit and dip for your fucking life
Remember one time, SC stole your fucking rights
You can't live without another kilogram
I wouldn't have some time, so fast I blew a hundred grand
A dollar cents, see men search over bins
Flashing all kinds of money with bitches to give me head
I hypnotized to the money and wealth
I was a hustler playing craps with max and drug myself
Damn! Coming down from the money and snitches
I got locked up for time at years up in the county prison
You can't believe from the pity and pain
I'm reminiscing to myself because I'm living in
Shame! Life's a bitch and there's no shame
And you get locked up, my mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up (say what?)
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck (yeah)
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Life's a bitch and then you get locked up
My mind is confused, goddamn, I'm stuck
Straight out of Folsom, Chino, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, New York in the house, punk-ass tricks
Latino bomba española, aquí toma ya
Nine-six
Os gooda veteranos OG's out there
Canalitos and canalitas, yeah
Órale
Livin' en la pinta, livin' en el barrio (Livin' in the pinta, livin' in the barrio)
Livin' con mis homeboys, con sangre en la mano
Livin' en la pinta, livin en el barrio
