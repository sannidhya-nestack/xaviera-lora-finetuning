Yeah, yeah, it's a dance
Yeah, yeah, uh
She wore her words like velvet lace
A puzzle wrapped
In the perfect face
Her eyes were knives
They cut through stone
She danced in shadows
Claimed my throne
I asked her name she gave a smile
Her laugh could twist the hands of time
I met the devil and she spoke in flames
Her mind a fire that I couldn't tame
She kissed my soul and I lost my name
I met the devil and she won the game (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Her voice a whisper yet it screamed
Like thunder wrapped in a fever dream
Her with the blade a tongue of spark
She lit the match that burned the dark
I tried to run she held me still
Her power bent my every will
She spun her charm with velvet thread
A thousand truths that bled me red
She wrote the rules then bent them twice
I paid her toll and rolled the dice
I met the devil, she spoke in flames
Her mind a fire that I couldn't tame
She kissed my soul and I lost my name
I met the devil and she won the game
