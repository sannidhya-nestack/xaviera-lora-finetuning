I used to free throw women but beef come with em
Grandmama said the police gone get em
Pop with my ass she like please don't hit em
Now it's vacation out in Reno chillin
Casino spinning we blow spinach
Hit the u you don't be so timid
I had it up to here with your hero
Image of ego is finished in three days
Got a style from the East Coast, admit it, so keep on pretending
I'll be on some pimping, the recent most gimmicks
Each floor is mimicked, the Jeep more attended
With heated floors in it, I'm usually thuggin' with some Gucci-luggin' C's
Groupies love it, life's like a movie, cousin
The entrepreneur, I sponsor the tour (that's true)
Droppin' manure, hip-hop connoisseur
The G's gone, get'em, the freaks come with'em
When these flows hit'em, the streets gone fill'em
The G's gone, get'em, the freaks come with'em
When these flows hit'em, the streets gone fill'em
It ain't hip hop no more, had this shit locked before
Slaughter MC's as I whip out my sword
Kids rock no more, cliques got divorced
Ordinary rappers thinking it's not a war
Neglecting the game, expecting to change
Rims ice and chains ain't much to explain
In that sixteen bars of a verse you spit
Now they gleaming and leaning and working the beat
They the stand up act they comedian rap
And I'll be damned if we ever met I'm feeding you death
So for every step taken with my heart on the road
Another crap LP full of garbage is sold
And as long as I got this freedom of speech
Put the thread through the needle unbelievably sweet
With a kick back flow I get that cho
I still can't wait till we get back home
The G's gone get em' the freaks come with em'
When these flows hit em' the streets gone fill em'
The G's gone get em' the freaks come
With em when these flows
Hit em the streets gon' feel em
Yo RG's gone
Get em the freaks come
With em when these flows
Hit em the streets gon' feel em
Yo RG's gone
Get em the freaks come
With em when these flows
Hit em the streets gon' feel em
I'm a cool mellow fellow
But never call me yellow
I break your bones
Me off all your eaters
Zello
Too complex your neighbor
I got what's your favor
Open up my goodie bag
I pull out your flavor
We smash large flows man
We keep on grindin' the streets gone buy it
We hit'em with that vibe to make'em get up on that line bitch
Pumped up adrenaline get back to Michigan
Dippin' in the Z ridin' slow on some Michelins
Peep my surroundings B-town be frownin'
Upon me but I gotta put my feet down and pound it shit bounce it
Bumpin' it, blowin' out your system
Won't start rippin'til the whole crowd listen
I need slim wrenches to feed my britches
Indeed I'm vicious, but I bees'bout business
The G's gone, get'em, the freaks come
With'em when these flows hit'em, the streets gone, feel'em
The G's gone, get'em, the freaks come
With'em when these flows hit'em, the streets gone, feel'em
Yo, the G's gone, get'em, the freaks come
With'em when these flows hit'em, the streets gone, feel'em
Yo, the G's gone, get'em, the freaks come
With'em when these flows hit'em, the streets gone, feel'em
