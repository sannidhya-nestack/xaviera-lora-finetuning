I'm a mellow guy roll up in the street, back up in the club, like a dance make you feel free
Check me out, watch me dance, foot on his feet and quick it, make you move like I'm quicky dance
Check me out, we style up in the club, while up and make you flip through, make you wanna jump
Sit back and relax and drink your wine, and talk it, make you move and make you feel fine
He's back, me and Mike is here
Jump up in the club and dance
And we no come and we no fear
He's back to dance make you flow
Make your wine go
Make you wanna come back and say disco
And everybody feeling fine
Drink your wine
Have a good time
Make you feel like you're fine
Everybody got the fancy clothes
Get wild up in the club
Make you feel like you're cold
Hit me style with me cool
And dress up in the bout dance
Come down me come down me got flick up
Bad boy them lick up
Sometimes they sick up
Pick up, hurt the schools, me let you choke up
Me like the way you move up in the club, yall
You swing your body, shake it, make it move up in the club
How you wind up in disco style, I whip you, make you whine
Come down and make you feel fine
Jump up, I miss the move, I miss the groove, yall
Come on whip the ting, I make you shake, I make you whine, yall
Hypnotize your body, make you wanna whine, yall
Come down and make you shake that body, yall
You got the ting, I make you move, make you groove
Back in style I make it wild make it smooth
Shake your body girl make it one big ting
Look at your eyes girl make them one bling
Hip style cool and ready them flocky
Sometimes me want sometimes me get lucky
Cool up on the club and sometimes I'm looking for the girl
Wild up I make it wild upon that girl
You know say me come down with this cooked ting
Shine body come down me wild upon the ting

Hip-hop style, coolie, make you wanna whine
Come down, make you feel like you're off a good time
Style body, girl, I make you feel like you whine
Come down, make you wanna have a good time
Jump-jump, show-talk to G-Mode

Everybody dancing on the disco floor
Make you whine, come down, I make you feel like you more
Two scenes, semi-wild and ting
Cool body shake, I make a roof that ting
Slap body coming out with a new groove
Make you dance, make you wanna get smooth
Drink the champagne, get wild pon the floor

The wicked come down and not stop no fight
