After all the crazy things that just went on
Can we be alone? Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? Can we be alone?
Listen to your favorite song
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Can we be alone?
On the way to ya
Almost got a ticket for speeding
Thinking bout you and what I'm needing
I had to come out with a damn good reason
I said Mr. Officer
Is there anything I can get it off of ya
I gotta get to her cause my heart's for her
I just need a little more time to talk with her
He said I'll let you go
Talk to her just as long as you slow down
If I catch you again you gon' go down
I just thought I'd let you know now
I said thank you I gotta go now
Since I have to really go slow now
He said consider this a warning
Since you're doing the most
You better wake up with this lady in the morning
After one heavy day that just went on
Can we be alone
Can we be alone
Can we be alone? Can we be alone?
Listen to your favorite song
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Can we be alone?
Now I'm knocking on your front door
I'm realizing there's nothing I want more
Then to be with ya
You didn't think I'd be on time did ya
Yeah I fooled you
I come to scoop you
So we can do what we wanna do
It's up to you
I pass the buck to you
Whatever baby it's cool
Now we get to the restaurant
I should've made reservations
All this time that we're wasting waiting
I could've been home making
Sweet love to you, laid up with chill
Touching you, holding you
Getting the most of you
Doing everything that I'm supposed to do
To show you, after all the crazy things I just went through
Can we be alone? Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? Can we be alone?
Listen to your favorite song
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Let's just be alone
Can't we be alone
All the crazy things
That's been going on
Trying to get to you
Get you all alone
All the crazy things
That's been going on
Trying to get to you
Get you all alone
Can't we be alone
Can't we be alone
Can we be alone? Can we be alone? (Listen to your favorite song)
Let's just be alone, let's just be alone
Let's just be alone, can we be alone?
