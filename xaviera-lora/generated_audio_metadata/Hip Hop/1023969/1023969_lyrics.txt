Now why would you want to stop right before the top
Give it everything you got then pull it up and plop down
Even if you could why would you want to pretend
That you ever wanted to blend and make it to the end with
Another dream that another human being let careen
Into the screen and disappearing scene
Another scene that the good earth don't need
Another seed that never breeds
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't let the drip drop hot
Hold up and make it lovely
Make it real and make it yours
Don't stop
But if you wanna just believe what you wanna believe
Then you can leave it up to me and I'll give you the key, it's easy
Just keep on hoppin', keep on rockin' and don't start stoppin'
Now it's everything you need just to water the seed
And if you wanna make it bleed, you can give it to me, I'll grease it
I'll believe for you, you wouldn't believe what I see in you
So don't stop, don't let the drip drop hop
Hold up and make it lovely, make it real and make it yours
So don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't let the dreams I hop, hold up and make it lovely, make it real and make it yours, girl stop
