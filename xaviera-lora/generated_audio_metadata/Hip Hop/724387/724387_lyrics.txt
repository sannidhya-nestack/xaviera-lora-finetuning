Woke up, I'm waving, on the seat like the Navy
Turned up, no behaving, everybody going crazy
Pink umbrella, peanut collider, got my pinky up, I sip it proper
Pretty women, I got a lot of, sipping with me down in Ensenada
Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts, I don't smoke but got a pack of ports
As a last resort, I sit matador, with a girl as yellow as a labrador
Sun is shining, the sky is blue, if the timing right I might find a boo
The music up, speakers banging, I'm on a boat, I'm feeling
I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat
I'm on the ocean broadcasting from a boat, from a boat
I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on the boat
In case you didn't get the note
I'm on a boat, I'm on aboat, I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on the boat, I's on the boat
I'm on the ocean broadcasting from a boat, from a boat
I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on a boat, I'm on the boat
In case you didn't get the note
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll, I'm on a, I'm on a, I'm on a roll, I'm on, I'm on a roll, I'm on I'm on a roll, I'm on a I'm on a roll, I'm on a Roll, I'm on a Roll, I'm on, I'm on a Roll, I'm on I'm on a Roll, I'm on a, I'm on a Roll, I'm on A Roll, I'm on a Roll, I'm on a Roll, I'm on a Roll, I've been rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin' Roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll-rollin', roll -
And proceeded to giggle
Turned around and took a sip
Backed it up on me and wiggled
Feel like a thousand degrees
I'm cooling down from the breeze
She put her hands on her knees
Backed it up all over me
I got my hand on her hip
Told her girl I dipped and you dipped
Man I'm happy that I took this trip
Girl if it's too hot then strip
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on a boat
I'm on the ocean broadcasting from a boat
From a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat
In case you didn't get the note
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on aboat)
I'm on the ocean broadcasting
From a boat (from a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a boat)
I'm on a boat (I'm on a float)
In case you didn't get the note
I'm on a boat
In the ocean, on the boat, on the boat, on the boat
I'm in motion, on the boat, on the boat, I'm on the boat
Yeah I'm on it, on the boat, on the boat, on the boat
And I'm floating, on the boat, on the boat, I "m on the boat
The sun's too bright so I'm in my shades
I had enough liquor give me lemonade
Trick I'm on the ocean I'm not on the land
You'd have to be with me here to understand
The captain even dancing on deck letting loose
You tell me we ain't living I'm a chunk of deuce
Yeah we get turnt up then we be living large
Don't hate on our life cause you ain't living ours
I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat
I'm on the ocean broadcasting from a boat, from a boat
I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat
I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the ocean broadcasting from a boat (from a boat)
I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat, I'm on the boat (in case you didn't get to know that I'm on the boat)
