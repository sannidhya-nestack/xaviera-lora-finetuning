I'm the king of rap, there is nothing higher
Giving y'all that fire, this that
As I proceed to give you what you need
This is strictly for the G's (woo-wee)
Live nigga on the rap, they salute me though
But it's probably cause I block out in the studio
It's the king, let me do my thing
Ain't nothing to hire, I require y'all to balance
Ayo, S is for that shit I provide
H for the heckling, catch the black orphans survive
Don't confuse me with them mother lames
We on that money train
Westy Snipes gettin' right with this hustle
Ain't none of y'all really in my league
I'm a beast, Danny the dog, I'm crawlin' through the streets
That's my right hand to guard, I'm a freak
I speak with the block, joggin', Glock sparkin'
Cop cars and got bars
And you want drama, you want a romp with a master killer
The crime saga, the Don Dada
Pally Pally leather goose'bout to let it loose
Pirelli shoes on the coupe, Machiavelli, whoo, whoo
Feelin' like a hundred milli in a suitcase
Rides speedin' down the highway bumpin' two chains
Got me creepin' down your block and bustin' Ruger's mane
They pointin' fingers but they really don't know who to blame
So analyze my persona
I'm high as an astronaut up in the clouds puffin' marijuana
Partner, this is feel good music for the fearless hoolim
Daddy Kane half-steppin' next to Dazza Facts
Livin' fast, Mach 1 with a shotgun
Cockin' and bussin'
Bloodclot, G-I-G-1 for your weapon
Play pussy, get fucked, get stuck
Hands high, give it up
See me ridin' with my niggas, what up?
I'm the king of rap
There is nothin' higher
Givin' y'all that fire
This that
As I proceed to give you what you need
This is strictly for the G's
Live nigga on the rap, they salute me though
But it's probably cause I block out in the studio
It's the king, let me, let me do my thing
Ain't nothing to hire, I require y'all to ballot, it's the ring
Side chick flexin' on my jack like nigga check me
Wifey goin' through my phone, she really tryna catch me
I'm a G so I never hit delete
I just tell her that I love her, them other chickens I sleep with'em
Ray Charles on them bras nigga play your part
Ali dodging strays yelling boobaye
Watch me rob them
They say a boy is like a calculus equation
I'm a problem no multiple choice
Ride out with the toaster
45 with that dirty 38 cobra hanging off my shoulders
Show's over
Hoes want the pipe stressing follow me on twitter
Y'all be going in the right direction
Money growing like Barack Obama chia pets
Some be flowing like Inostradamus weed and sex
Licking a dope track
Money spilling out my coat swag jack
I say I'm bald like Kojak
But this is an introduction to vintage hustlin'
Niggas thuggin' in car, hard-knitted to fit it
Top notch exhibits in between the rhymes
My lyrics provide images for optimists and kids to mimic
And y'all mad'cause this is my world
You just a squirrel clutchin' my nuts
Dippin' like Marv Hagler, sick with the hard grammar
But punchlines never paid the bills though
And this is why I hit y'all with that real flow
I'm the king of rap, there is nothin' higher
Givin' y'all that fire, this that
As I proceed to give you what you need, this is for victory
Live nigga on the rap, they salute me though
But it's probably cause I block out in the studio
It's the king, let me, let me do my thing
Ain't nothin' to hire, I require y'all to bow like you can kiss the ring
Twenty bars, runnin' laps like triathlon
Baby moms got a ass like Bonita Applebaum
Let me put you niggas, haha, look at that
I'm the king, I ain't even gotta give y'all niggas a third verse
Just ride out to my shit
I'ma get y'all outta the next one though, remember that
