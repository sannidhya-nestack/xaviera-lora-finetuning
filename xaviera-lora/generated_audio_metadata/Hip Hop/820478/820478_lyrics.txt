I could love you better
Better than anyone
I love you better, baby
Love you better, baby
There's a sigh on my finger like the one on my head
There's a rusty key in my pocket, a cold sight to my bed
There's a house on the south side, another ice-nosed barbeque
These pills ain't working no more, but I'll, I'll just take the last few
I could love you better, love you better, baby, oh
I could love you better, baby
I could love you better
Love you better, baby
Better than anyone
You know it could be forever
There's a letter in the notebook
A picture fades inside
A timeless reminder
Lives that coincide
Take the time to remember
Faithless as it can feel
Some things are just ain't otten
Will I wake or is it real? (I could love you better) is it real?
Better than anyone (you know it could be forever)
I could love you better (love you better baby) better than anyone (you know it could be forever)
I could love you better (love you better)
Better than anyone (I could love you better, baby)
Take the time to remember
Better than anyone (you know it could be forever)
I love you better, baby (oh-oh)
Love you better, baby
I love you better, baby, oh
Love you better, baby
Days are time just for laughter, a time to cry
I think we shall stormy weather, days that's warm and dry
Take the time to remember, pain less it can be
Can I close the door forever?
But keep that around, stay key (I could love you better) love you better, baby (better than you are)
I could love you better, baby (I could love you better) love you better baby (better than you are)
You know it could be forever
Yeah, I need to love, I need to love, I need to love you
Better be there
I, I wanna love you, baby
Better be there
Take the time to remember
I knew, I knew
I could love you better
Better than anyone
I knew I wanna love you
I could love
