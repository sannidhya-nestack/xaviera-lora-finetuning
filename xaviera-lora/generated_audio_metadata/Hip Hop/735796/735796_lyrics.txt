I'm a teacher of the masses, Malcolm X with the glasses
A lecturer in your class is blast, it's never blasphemous
Shine brighter with no lighters, internal fire
True writer back in the day, call me that typewriter
Knowledge based, the bars are never cut in paste
Word, I'm your saving grace, people not is no debate
I make it okay, oh hey, let me get that air
Diamond in that rough for the touch of your mom's loving care
A new age
A new plague is in a flux
Everything is online
Newspapers drying up
Technology the universal remedy
We used to read books
Now them libraries empty
I got my mind made up
Talk to the world
I'ma do it straight up
Never act fake and never played up
Now stop weight up
Stop weight up and rise
Rise rise
I hope you're ready
Hope you're ready
I'ma tell it to'em, I'ma tell'em that
When the wise men told me the gems of wisdom
Come only once in a lifetime
So when the lights is on and the mic is on, I'ma hit'em
Yeah yeah when the lights is on and my mic is on, I'ma hit'em
I see the world through a telescope, I tell her hope and let me quote
Faith let me be the pope, stress let me stop the stroke
The education, the desperation of learning
When kids become the vermin, the future is so uncertain
Sex at you fifteen, your low esteem is evident
Your innocence is going and your baby needing benefits
Jobs, your house, your dreams and your spouse
If knowledge could be the key then proceed to work it out
Flip the mic switch full clip of my two cents
I'm due to vent when sharing my thoughts they turn to events
Take the podium pressing this revolution and blessing your institution
With love you're not refuting so
I got my mind made up
Talk to the world I'ma do it straight up
Never act fake and never played up
Now stop weight up
Stop weight up and rise rise rise
I hope you're ready hope you're ready
I'ma tell it to'em, I'ma tell'em now
When the wise men told me the gems of wisdom
Come only once in a lifetime
So when the lights is on and the mic is on I'ma hit'em
Yeah yeah when the lights is on and my mic is on I'ma hit'em
And when I return, I'm giving you my heart
Stop, listen, I'm ready
Lights is on, I'ma play my part
You gotta believe you can do anything, huh?
This is the revolution, the revolution
Computed to your memory
Living life for money, causing music
Now that's everything
Take my words forever, they can't tell me a better way
And the wise men told me the gems of wisdom
Come only once in a lifetime
So when the lights is on and the mic is on imma hit em
Yeah yeah when the lights is on and my mic is on imma hit em
