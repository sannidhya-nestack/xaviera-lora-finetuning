City lights flicker, broken dreams scream loud
In the concrete jungle we fight the crowd
Where the world spins, a deaf ear to the downtown's plea
Streetwise, tough skin just trying to be free
Suicidized crime they don't even see us
We spit rhymes raw, unpolished, unjust
Concrete can't fight fist up
Can't win but we live briefly for the city's sin
City lights flicker, broken dreams scream loud in the concrete jungle
We fight the crowd when the world spins, a death gear to the downtown's bleed
Streetwise, tough skin just trying to be French
Suicidize, pong, they don't even see us, we spit rhymes raw, unpolished, unjust
Concrete can't fight this stuff, can't win but we live briefly for the city's sin
They cry from down
Echoes of the heart, flapping at your vow
We the backbone for guiding in your calling
Break the chains, it's the stain you don't know
Who they speak louder than the man in the soup alleys?
What's the secret city talk?
Pursuit fast, talk hustle hard
Grind on Brooklyn street
We rise, fall, stand tall to our own beat
Me on light, blind sight, stubborn face
Restless nights, fight right, saving grace
The underdogs roar beneath the elite's feet
Pulse of the pavement, every step we repeat
Up, up, down, up, down, make crown crumble down
Echoes of the lost, nothing that shall frown
We the backbone, otten in your glow
We break the chains, ditch the shame you don't know
Up down, hotel fake, cloud born down
Echo from the loft, laughing at your frown
We the backbone, otten in your glow
Break the chains, ditch the shame you don't know
