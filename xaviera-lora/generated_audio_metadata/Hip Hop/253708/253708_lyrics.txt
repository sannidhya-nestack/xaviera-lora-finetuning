Let's talk about this life in the streets
It's like a Glock hot back bussin' at beats
They don't bust me, police discussin' life's a guess
At least fifty rounds when I'ma leave in distress
The coast, haters gone, hate on the X
I don't care, cop back, dog ready to flex
What about my dogs runnin' the West?
Always roll with the Glock and the Vest
You know the block and the cone is a mess
I'm a hustler, hustler to death
Ever felt that deep flame dog straight in your chest?
The coast, that beat see
The beach rollin' the bets, or in the dot, y'all
Smokin' the sets, beatin' the cracks
Never thought of bein' the best, or wantin' more than the rest
Let me tell y'all'bout a hustle of stress
When I feel it, it's like who can fuck with the X?
My block up all night, hustlin' to death
