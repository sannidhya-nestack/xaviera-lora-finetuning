So many things I want in life man
Will I get em? Shit I don't know
Feel me
Mo is a fiend for a whole lot of things
Everything I want in a cop I only seen in my dreams
Everything I want in a cop seem to surpass my means
I made it through a hustle and distribute some samples to fiends
Money I want to dream and I want to cream
What I want in life is to live lavishly
I stay in some cheeks you know I be monaging these freaks
I tap you from the back that way I get in deep
What I want in life is some prosperity
You heard me I want a crib in the city
With all of my peeps
I want a portion of the cruiser and a couple of jeeps
I wanna trip out to Belize and smoke a few trees
I want a female that's scared to get on her knees
I wanna take her absolute leave, absolute leave
From the work piece and think about selling that D
A couple of trees already rocking that TCP
What I want in life is to get my cash
What I want in life
Money's not to live in the past what I want in life
Cousin is to rule the world what I want in life
For once it's to trust my girl what I want in life
Son is to get my cash what I want in life
Money's not to live in the past what I want in life
Cousin is to rule the world what I want in life
For once it's to trust my girl what I want in life
My girl, I need me the dough and the cash
I'm building my stash
I know I'm repeating myself
It's the only way I'ma last
I wanna live that life that I see on TV
Fly down to Orlando and chill in the palm trees
And hide up in shorties and thongs with fatties
Spend about three G's, dog, in less than a week
Fly first class money with the window seat
With all of my peeps, eat whatever we want to eat
I want my mom to pop deuce'cause I live that life
I want her to trust in Christ'cause some boys are hype
He protect your soul dad so don't put up a fight
And mom hit church on Sunday plus Wednesday night
Woah, yeah I'm religious yo I trust in God
I don't do everything right but I'm trying hard
What I want for you to take me in is your son
On your last day you look at me and say well done
What I want son is to get my cash
What I want
Money's not to live in the past, what I want in life
Cousin is to rule the world, what I want in life
For one sister trust my girl, what I want in life
Son is to get my cash, what I want in life
Money's not to live in the past, what i want in life
Cousin is to rule the world, what i want in life
For one sister trust my girl, what I want in life
My girl what I want in life is a crib filled with guns
Fill em up with jerichos and revolvers
Son what I want in life is to regulate my funds
Living off my interest after stacking them ones
I wanna invest my cream so I can live my dream
I wanna hook up my shorty with diamonds and rings
I wanna get in this rap game showing my skills
Man I was born in the very south mood of the beach sands
I want your cheddar so I can look better
For packing through reddish you still pop a chicken
Whatever don't make me go and sever your arms
And sell all your leathers after I
Rob your monkey ass including your cello
What I want in life is to stop popping shit about who I sound like
Money sound as dick saying you rap like dudes
You sound like king you rap like beef
Nigga I sound like me
What I want in life is to get my cash
What I want in life
Money's not to live in the past, what I want in life
Cousin is to rule the world, what I want in life
For one sister trust my girl, what I want in life
Son is to get my cash, what I want in life
Money's not to live in the past, what i want in life
Cousin is to rule the world, what i want in life
For one sister trust my girl
