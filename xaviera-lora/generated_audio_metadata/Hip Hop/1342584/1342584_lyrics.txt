Ooh yeah, alright, hold my hand, we're taking flight
Oh yes and let's win
Take my hand we're jumping in
Oh children go strong
Hear my words sing my song
Oh yes and let's fight
Gonna take the school tonight
What I've been through, what I've seen, used to be the American dream
Now it seems I went a different route, different clout, had to pay a different amount
How much I had to pay, just to make it to another day
Tired of my time delayed, so I sit down and I play
Lord keep me safe, keep bad things away
Help accomplish all my tasks everyday while you're safe
Protect my family, let my people live happily
Best of all, help me, master me, in God we sing
In God we sing, we don't need no bands or bling
We just need to seize the day, oh yeah, while you sing
Oh, it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright, oh yeah
Once in your life you had strength
You had problems, you faced them
You rock, oh yeah, you rock
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah
Lord keep me safe
Keep bad things away
Help accomplish all my plans
Every day while you're safe
Oh, it's always the same old story
When you are young, life is challenging
You to reach higher and farther
Just reach out, reach it out, it's higher, it's farther, it's farther, it's farther, it is farther, yeah
So far in front of you, that's why you gotta reach out and reach out please do
That's why you gotta reach out
That's why you gotta reach out and reach out please do
In God we sing, we don't need no bands or bling
We just cling to seize the day, oh yeah, while you sing
Oh, it's gonna be alright, alright, oh yeah
