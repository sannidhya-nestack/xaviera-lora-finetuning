Inside I'm a wasteland, it's so hard to live with a broken heart
See I'm so hopeless, don't want you to see my scars
Inside I'm a wasteland, it's so hard to live with a broken heart
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
Wake up feels good, smile radiates
Hoping that the day can make a proud lady great
People say I'm beautiful, beauty of it's brighter
Everything that I've been through, assuming I'm a fighter
But they don't understand it's something that side burns
Making the same mistakes, it's nothing that I learned
Cause played wrong, hard to see it in my face
Cause I'm happy everyday but I'm eager to replace this
This burning sensation
Four walls, no windows, no ventilation
Knife in my chest, no ending, it's penetration
A heart that's minted, it's bending and then it's breaking
Gone
And I swear I was stronger, everything that it was
Can't compare to the drama but nobody knows
Cause I'm happier than ever but it feels like I'm cornered and I'm mad we're not together like man
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
See I'm so hopeless
Don't want you to see my scars
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
The love of my life said it's over
Said he's getting older and his heart is getting colder
Tryna defend the wing like I was starting cephalos, your more days or let it sink in
I lost my head and shoulders so weak
And I don't wanna go to work, don't wanna put on a front
I don't wanna show what hurts, feels like I died, he got away with bloody murder
Why would he want me hurtin', or why would he want me further away?
Wasn't we good just a week ago?
Just put me in the water, let me sink below now
Gotta keep my smile on bright
And make sure they can't tell I cried all night and I swear
Feels like I'll never love again
Just hoping that the next person understand
I'm not ready for love, don't want my guard down
In the summer they'll see how I lost pounds
This ain't right though, no
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
See I'm so hopeless
Don't want you to see my scars
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
A weeks pass, can't breathe
Lay a strip away and it ain't me
Lookin' in my eyes and I can't sleep
Four o'clock in the morning it's the same thing
Hey life goes on keep tellin' myself
Lost in the mirror
Soul searching tryna cross the Sahara tryna find home
But the strip is gone from my spirit I know
I'm laughing like nothing has changed
Never thought love lost was a bad thing
They thought that I'm strong I don't have the heart to tell em
Don't wanna spill my guts don't understand the feeling I know
It's crazy this front I'm putting on
But if I slip once I'm as good as gone
And maybe one day I will come clean
I'll say how I loved him he didn't love me
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
See I'm so hopeless
Don't want you to see my scars
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
See I'm so hopeless
Don't want you to see my scars
Inside I'm a wasteland
It's so hard to live with a broken heart
Inside I'm a wasteland
Inside I'm a wasteland
