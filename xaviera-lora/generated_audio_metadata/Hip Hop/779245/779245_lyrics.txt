(crying)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Pussies on the shawty, drop it down low
Dance to the flow, make it clap, make it roll
Pussies on the shawty, drop it down low
Dance to the flow, make it clap, make it roll
She ot she was got drunk
Leave in the air don't move back up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up
Bustas on the shawty, drop it down low
Dance to the flow, make it clap, make it roll
This is for the guys who's got drunk
Keys in the air, don't move, I go, go
Bustas on the shawty, drop it down low
Dance to the flow, make it clap, make it roll
This boy got juice, got drunk
Who's in the gate don't move, now go
