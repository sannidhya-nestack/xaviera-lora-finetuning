ST3
Detrimental
Mr. Blitz is the wickedest
Tranquilizing the niggas that thinkin' they're lyrical nicks
It's the illest and in fact, deathly mental
Comin' through with the fat gats, the gats and that's that
Let's get into the mix
A sucker for love, I guess I can't admit that
this is where I'm at in the rap
Don't ever take it for joke though
You takin' it for a joke, yo
Can be independent and ain't even normally roll
Especially when it comes to right feet
Don't ever excite me
You can get the bees and fleas
Showin' the tales, shit you can never prevail
Could use a B-I-T-C-H-B-I-L
If I see more parkour on a sweet track
But I gotta let them know in the back that it's the bit tonight
If you ever think you're getting monoloded, mon on ya, I'ma black your cat
If you'll stop talking, I'll do what you say
If you clean handin' me,'cause most can't hang
If you can live up to your words, boy
I'll show you everything in a lot more'cause ooh
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's high here for the ride do whatever you want
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's high here for the ride do whatever you want
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's high
You know you make me feel like loving you
Kissing you, grinding my body on you
Making love to you and then
Being with you'til the morning comes then
I gotta go, I'm not the only one who
Should you bet on the daily?
It was a one time thing, let me go please if
Last night was special to you
I don't know what to tell you
Other than you got me in the mood
And I was feeling your attitude
And no, I don't want you to be my due
So let's meet up at the club again
And we can grind and start whining
And then do it all over again
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's hot here for the ride do whatever you want
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's hot here for the ride do whatever you want
I want you to pick it up then drop it like it's hot
You know you make me feel like
Guess I can break it down now, how I adore you
Yeah the best wishes about dudes,'bout time I take time
Tired of waiting on the line and ain't moving, it's time for improving mine
I need a lady that's sophisticated to fit the XXX rated operated dick
And if you a gangster bitch, let me see you grab it click and rub it like a itch
You best believe I'ma examine the tocha chocha, just the case for H .I .P.
'Cause these bitches quick to come a quick break
Disease is to decease me
To blitz on and push on a bitch with the oxy touch
When I want to watch then I dodge
Listen I don't mean to be cruel
All I want is good food and to finesse the mood
Inconceivable
Showing you what I'm into
No other girl would ever do
Everything I do for you
you get me in the mood
You really get me in the mood
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's hot
And I'm feeling your baddest baddest
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's hot
But still I don't want you to be my
Drop it like it's high
You know you make me feel like
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's high
You don't really get me in the mood
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's high
And I'm feeling your baddest baddest
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's high
But still I don't want you to be my demon
Pick it up then
Drop it like it's high
You know you make me feel like
