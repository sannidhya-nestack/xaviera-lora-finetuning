I saw a bug bat toddlin' the cracks of the street
A bloodin' struggle, they had plastic screens
The cellophane cuts were almost like yours and mine
Until a brave one crawled to my ear
And he told me of his trials in the street crack theater
I grinned as if I cared
He smiled like he had the time
He said, "In whose camp does your banner flyin'?
Can I have you on my side?"
He loaded a pistol, but I replied
I said, I'm Antepo, no shout catechist
So keep your pants with political activists
You take your cause for lack of a purpose in life
Pursuit of happiness, ooh, demonia
Good spiritness, you live in proof that ignorance ain't this
Praying, libero no somalo in free Tibet
You never prayed for the souls with the fixed bayonets
Well I wave like a man being shot from the cannon
Born on this track of warm rock curling through nothing
Only on the front so spirit can fight
Storm the Bastille of desperate life and dance in the street
Every night until the day I die
The bug replied.
He said, "It's been a long while" and the dialogue to win
To Grant, Sarah Franklin, when Lincoln's just a fin
Positive value for this bug since you're so well balanced
Gaining perspective from the outermost valance
You never keep what you eat, you have to use labor with action
But you're thinking too evolved to fight for my faction
We're currency baby as we live and breathe
That's steel for you, Attica for me
I'm going back to my cell where I breathe a little free
But let me give a final thought like a Jerry Springer
If happiness is as bad as you can call my purpose love
To survive I fight the battle and to me you're the bug
Thunder struck, I sat on the curb
Realizing I could be a social sir
Then I saw my small confessor, he got killed in a raid
I would've stomped out his assassin if I wasn't so affaned
Said I rose to my feet, I walked straight home
I locked myself in, I wrote out this song
I think of the bug while I'm dancing in the street
Every time my neighbor throws his sneaker at me
I feel his restless spirit longing to fight
While I'm drinking and singing in the middle of the night
Then it hits me
The bug was right.
That's it.
