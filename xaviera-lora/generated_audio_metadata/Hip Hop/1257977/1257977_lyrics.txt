Barking for a friend, sounding up to crazy, but
Like an in-depth, making friends after stress
The bubble of hot, it's just as soon as I got
Like a rocket in the brain, just to make it stop
Are you a bark horde?
Yeah, is your ground so right?
Is this your plan today?
Are you your plan today?
Are you your plan today?
Are you your plan today?
Are you a bark horde?
Is it time to learn this? We should climb today
Are you here for today?
Are you here for today? Are you here to climb today?
Right next door to me is a mean nasty troll
He looks down the block just a short little stroll
Neighbours they come in all shapes and sizes
But wait there's Tracy and all her surprises
And she's only 10th grade
She just got a load of her grades are a mess
But it doesn't concern her
Everyday in my neighbourhood is filled with straight actors
Load after load of complicated factors
Kickin' it in the neighborhood
Hit me up like the old times
My brother's always all good
Little drop of thine maybe even a rhyme
In the neighborhood
My neighborhood
There's a couple that died in a seething decay
They moved in last year and won't go away
From the boisterous family their laughter all screams
They need to shut up and stop the extremes
While the trolls devour us all sense of civility
I find Tracy's nature, I find viability
But things get strange in the neighbourhood
When old mid-hallowed comes out of the wood
He's got a much stranger than we thought that he could
He's up to no good in all likelihood
Kicking it in the neighborhood
Hit me up like the old times
My brother's always all good
Little drop of thyme maybe even a rhyme
In the neighborhood
My neighborhood
And Tracy with her learner's permitting hand
Is amusingly pleasant and much in demand
But I don't think she gets what the learning's about
When she looks at me with her cute little paw
And that crazy couple with the gardening mess
Just seem to enjoy an irrational distress
With such strange food
Their garden enlarges
It's a wonder they're not facing criminal charges
And the troll's ugly life makes them look debonair
When they are together it's quite a big stare
It's hard to imagine how they ever got hitched
It must be a curse and likely bewitched
For this is where I live today
It's my neighbourhood
Won't you come to play
If you come today
We'll have so much fun
By tomorrow I'm sure
We'll be needing a gun
Are you part of it?
Is it counteractors?
If you come today
Are you, you come today
We'll have so much fun
By tomorrow I'm sure
What we need ain't a gun
Like Tracy with her learners, permitting hand
It's amusingly pleasant and much in demand
But I don't think she gets what the learning's about
When she looks at me with her cute little pouch
And that crazy couple with the gardening nest
Just seem to enjoy any racial distress
With such strange fruit they're gardening largest
It's a wonder they're not facing criminal charges
And the troll's ugly wife makes it look never-near
When they are together it's quite a big scare
It's hard to imagine how they ever got hitched
It must be a curse and likely bewitched
But this is where I live today, it's my neighborhood
Won't you come to play, it's my neighborhood
Won't you come to play, we'll have so much fun
We'll have so much fun, we'll have so much fun
We'll have so much fun
In the neighborhood
My neighborhood
In the neighborhood
My neighborhood
Kid you the living gun
Like hit me up like the old times
My father it's always all good
We'll drop or die
Maybe even a ride
