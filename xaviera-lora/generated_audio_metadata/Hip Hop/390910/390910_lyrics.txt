Millennium Raps baby, check, check
Life's a gamble no muscle gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger avoid danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow to solve who I'll be able to swallow
Life's a gamble no muscle gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger avoid danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow the sorrow I'll be able to swallow
I've been through so many stages and phases of life
Engaging the mic, lacing the pages I write
Paying the price, wasting my ages ain't right
Caged in I fight, the race is creating a hype
Facing my plight and the dangers that hasten my height
Placing my sight on the angles I'm receiving the light
Waiting to strike, I camouflage a cable device
Then label your type, the type who turn the tables for spite
Debating the bite I counteract you chasing my flight
And hating my might my bite just make your verses ignite
Life's a gamble no muscle gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger weight danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow the sorrow I'll be able to swallow
Life's a gamble no muscle gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger weight danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow the sorrow I'll be able to swallow
Don't shuffle with the struggle, it's the hustle, it's hard, I shuffle the cards
Tryna cut the stubble, these cards
Ain't got enough muscle to tussle with God
Thinking you rough and tumble, still gotta suffer the charge
Ain't no escape, can't outrun fate, this week's your wake
In these plates, a new release date for your piece of the cake
Cause sleeping late's a known trait of making mistakes
And faking jacks won't only hold you back, it'll make you ache
Life's a gamble, no muscle, gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger, avoid danger, down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow, don't matter, long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow, the sorrow, I'll be able to swallow
Life's a gamble, no muscle, gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger, avoid danger, down the tunnels you travel
Hollow or narrow, don't matter, long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow, the sorrow, I'll be able to swallow
One roll of the dice can only display one way of life
Some say it's hype, some say they don't play
Some say I'm nice, some say we enslaved, but I say we right
Birth in a quiet conscience with concepts
That's constant and dominant and stay on step
Get caught up in my harm's way
And it's game to aims beyond play
that bullshit ricochet
Life's a gamble, no muscle, gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger void danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow and narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow the sorrow I'll be able to swallow
Life's a gamble no muscle gotta hustle and scramble
Channel your anger void danger down the tunnels you travel
Hollow and narrow don't matter long as my shadow follow
Maybe tomorrow the sorrow I'll be able to swallow
