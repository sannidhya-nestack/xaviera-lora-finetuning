Yeah, oh
Coming in real fast to the city
I saw the turn you was about to take
You hardly gave me any warning
You barely
Use your face
Oh
So true
Would it be too much to ask you
For a break on the fair?
Hey, some slight considerations please
No more light stairs
Ride it slowly
To the scenes
As the driver
You're so mean
Hey
I come to see you
At the station
I'll be wearing blues for the blues
I won't take but just a moment
I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna ride that silly silly train away from you
Hey, send a train
