Cool like cool like cool like cool like cool like cool like cool cool like cool like cool like cool like cool like
So cool her favorite color blue
Clinking ice cubes by the pool all due
Praise to the day amazing grace
Raise up a glass the taste is just fabulous
Lush life bubble cush puff pipe
Hovering above life and it's just right
Loving all the right places
You can't face it, shit, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, shit, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like shit, cool like, cool like, cool like cool like, cool like, cool like, cool like
When I met her, she had a sweater on, summertime attitude like she the one
I'm like at a number 9, tattoos and a bad mood
Black frames, breathing air like she can't lose
Broke out the mini-bik, lit up a cigarette
Camelite to the lips, waitress came to get the check
She said listen, um well nothing
I can almost see the thoughts running through her mind
Running down the line on the bullet pointed list
Let's go, one, I can tell he ain't got money
But two, well, yeah he is kinda funny
And three, but see it's like the six degrees
Separation, she knew a girl I used to date
That's appropriate
What's your name? Say it so I don't et
She said Grace, you know
Table and a placemat in Angel's face
Put the devils in the rape bins
Who like who like who like who like who like who like who like who like who like who like
Who would like, who would like, who would like, who would like?
Be cool, what I'm telling myself
Time is what matters when developing the film
Got the chemical still when the dark room fills
She got the wide angle lens and a gaggle of friends
They flock with the weather, knock the block off the meter
We walk together and we talk about the recent books that she's read
Listen to vinyl, different from a hipster, her hips don't lie bro
I think I'm liable to spit it live while you quote so let's toast
Lift the drinks from the coasters
Let the smoke smolder
Everybody pause when she roll up
Ah hold up is that cherry cola
Six pack got some cold ones
Doja Rhodes up head about to blow up
Oh what man about to show up
Show love flow like the O .C .E. to the A .N .C .U .A kid
Who like who like who like who like who like who like who
Who would like, who would like, who would like, who would like?
