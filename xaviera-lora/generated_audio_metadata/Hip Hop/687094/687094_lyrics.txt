Ah, yeah, oh
Oh, tell me baby, tell me baby
Magic baby, magic baby
Mama, you need a man to adore you
Put some excitement in your life and not bore you
Someone to hear you out, not ignore you
You see me, I don't mind doing these things for you
Whatever you wanna do, just name it
My pockets the same as my name is, I'm famous
I might see these boys still stainless
No pain no gain miss cause I'm brain dressed
I wanna but I'm kinda scared to talk to you
(I'm kinda scared to talk to you)
Show me why should is what you're out to do
(Show me something)
Keep it real with me is what you got to do
(Just keep it real with me)
In the condition I'll be in hope you got energy
Cause you got a lot to do
You're the reason why I should be with you (you)
With all the crazy things I've already been through (with all the crazy things I've already been through)
What makes you so different, so different
From the last who, from the last who (from the last who)
From the last who that I was dealing with (uh-oh)
First of all, don't compare me to them other cats
You can't even come near me with them other cats
You supposed to have a brother's back
Give me a little more credit, ma, what's up with that?
I'm trying to take you out of life that's average
So you can live lavish and travel with me to Paris
Cause you was flying JetBlue when I met you
I had to upgrade you to private jet spool
Cause I respect you
Something sexy and soft to lay next to
I wanna wife you not ex you
Cause to me in my eyes you know what
You something special
I could never et you
This man here will always beget you
And baby that's for sure
Is there anything else you wanna know
Just give me one reason why (give me one reason why) I should be with you (I should be with you)
With all the crazy things I've already been through (with all the crazy things I've already been through)
What makes you so different (what makes you so different) from the last you (from the last you)
From the last you that I was dealing with
You don't know how much you mean to me (You don't know, don't know)
You know we're not playing no games (No, no, no, no, no games, baby)
But if it is what it is and you're into me (Are you into me?)
Well then let's just go ahead (To the damn thing)
You wanna be my number one baby
You wanna be my number one baby, well shall we proceed? (Yes indeed)
You wanna be my number one baby
You wanna be my one and only baby, well shall we proceed? (Yes indeed, first you gotta)
Why? I should be with you with all the crazy, crazy, crazy things that I've been through
that's what makes you so different
Cause like you have a feeling you would
Just give me one, one good reason
With all the crazy things that I've been through
Something that makes us so different
Just give me one reason why
Why, why, baby, baby, can't be feeling you
