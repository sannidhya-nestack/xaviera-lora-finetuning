Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel your touch electric
Every moment the faintest, yeah
Our love it never fades
Oh, our love it never fades
Well, it's for sweet confession, know just who I'm needin'
You bring the fire, boy, you set my soul a-breathin', oh
Underneath the stars we're dancing through the night
Locked in your arms if everything feels right
Close the door
You gotta hold on me, won't let go
Your kiss is like a potion
In this magical motion, oh
We ride this wave so free
Oh, we ride this wave so free
Every glitch is built, my heart beats faster, oh, it's thrilling
With every touch, boy, you'll see my senses fillin' up
Grace, the tingling shade, another moonlight
Two hearts aligned, they're torn tight
Just stay close (just stay close)
You've got hold on me, won't let go
In this world of ours, I've got greatest strength
Take my hand, together we'll go any length
Immersed in you, I'll never feel afraid
Our love forever will oh never fade
So stay close, stay close
You got hold on me, won't let go
