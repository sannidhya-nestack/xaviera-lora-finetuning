Yeah, skip dogs back
Yo check this
I got a question for y'all
Do you ever feel so good
About the situation you're in right now
That you don't even care what you've been through
All the bad stuff, the heartache, the pain
You wouldn't change it if you could
Cause it's what's led you to where you are right now
And right now, everything's perfect
It's kinda how I feel
It's kinda how I feel about this
It's kinda how I feel about this album
They say the beginning don't determine the outcome
But I'm a hit hard knock'em out round one
This is Ultimate Rhymin'
Welcome to the octagon
Do you know what I've been through to do this?
Do you know how long it took me to prove this?
Since the days a flight attendant was a stewardess
I've been waiting for this moment patiently pursuing it
My path has say the least been ruinous
What I've been through a little bit ludicrous
But I'm here still real still doing it
Love conquers all skip dogs better prove this
Yeah, woo
If you feel good right now
I need you to do something for me
I need you to just
Put your hands together like this
Come on
Clap
Clap, clap, come on
Clap, clap, clap, clap, come on
I need you to get up, get down
Everybody gather'round, show love
And throw'em up, come on
Get up, get down
Everybody gather'round, show love
And throw'em up
I need you to get up, get down
Everybody gather'round, show love
And throw'em up, come on
Get up, get down
Everybody gather'round, show love
Put'em up!
I don't know why I love this life
All I know is it feels so right
I could do this thing every night
It's like marriage when I rap it's for life soon
Pop champagne put it on ice and
Throw mics in the sky like rice
I never know what's coming out of my mouth
It's kinda like throwing flows down like dice
I'm taking over like an 08 Democrat
Restoring grace to hip hop America
Put your boots on lace up America
Skip dogs here brace up America
I fell in love with the taste of America
We don't normally display in America
How long I had pace through America
Just to find my place in America
Get up get down everybody gather round show love
And throw em up come on
Get up get down everybody gather round show love
And throw'em up (I need you to)
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round, show love
And throw'em up (come on)
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round show love
Put'em up (I need you to)
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round show love
And throw'em up (come on)
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round show love
And throw'em up, I need you to
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round, show love
And throw'em up, come on
Get up, get down, everybody gather'round show love
Put'em up
