Yeah, I know
(D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-b)
Drivin' in my car in the middle of the day
Finished with my work now it's time to play
Been a long hot day'cause I'm thinkin' about
Your love
Can't live without
Now I'm out on the road doin' 80
Jammin' to the hippie hop just like in Haiti
Drop top down in the sun
Make a little trip to see my number one hun
Do what you do, I like the way you do it
Driving, driving me wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving me wild every day
I got the will if you got the day (uh, uh)
Driving in my car in the middle of the night
Cop pulled me over, started reading my rights
I looked right at him and said, "Wish I could hang"
But that'd put me late, by a god dang minute for my date
Straight mate, a hot little swamp fox took in the bait
So the cop gave in'cause he knew that look
He'd seen it all before and he knew exactly what it took
Do what you do, I like the way you do it
Driving, driving me wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving me wild every day
I got the will if you got the way
You got the way, you got the way
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Ooh, I hit me, take my time (oh, oh)
Ooh, I hit me, lose my mind
Oh, I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Throwin' down with the lyrical jam
So deaf you got to say damn
Smooth like a razor through the microphone
Cuttin' through like static on your telephone
Listen to the lyrical master
Blastin' on the scene and creatin' a disaster
Boom, hump right on cue
Before you know it, I bought and sold you
Drivin', drivin' me wild all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme (you, you, rhyme)
Driving, driving me wild every day (ay)
I got the will if you got the way (ay)
Driving, driving (driving) me wild all the time (ay)
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme (got the rhythm)
Driving, driving me wild every day (ay)
I got the will if you got the way
With the mind of blue
I liked the way
Been like a duck and see
I thought the rhythm
Started reading my rights
I looked right at him
And said wish I could hang
But that'd put me late
By a god dang minute for my date
Straight mate
A hot little swamp fox digging the bait
So the cop gave in'cause he knew that look
He had seen it all before and he knew exactly what it took
Do what you do
I like the way you do it
Driving driving (huh)
Meanwhile all the time (ay)
I got the rhythm you got the rhyme (you got time)
Driving driving (huh)
Meanwhile everyday (ay)
I got the will if you got the way
Driving driving
Meanwhile all the time (ay)
I got the rhythm you got the rhyme
Driving, driving me wild
Everyday I got the will if you got the way
You are
You are the way, yeah
Oh, oh
