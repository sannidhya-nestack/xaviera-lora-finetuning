One, two, one, two, yeah, uh, uh
It's the man, stay in need, uh, check it, check it
It's the man, F-A-L-I, F-A-L-I
Check me out, yo
It all started as a toddler, my soul was strugglin'
Four plus five is what I was packin', the trigger I be huggin'
Dippin' in the moonlight, too tight, had O's to slang
Kendi coded, "SS," banged out, sittin' on things
Life was hectic, but I checked it, my portions was filled
Misinterpret who I be, slip around and get killed
Doubtin' me, playin' games with me, get blown off the block
No clothes, no shoes, you lift out your socks
Family members took a weight, all straight in the line
They said I was too young to feel it, still losing my mind
So I cried through the lyrics, writing to the music
Statistically be dead at 21, wouldn't get a chance to use it
If you wanna come at me you better
Get down, if you wanna come at me you better
Get down, if you wanna come at me you better
Get down, if you pull that bust ass
Cause you know I'm a clown
Pistol pack a pot of slinger
Loyal to my block
Started off with a fifty pack and flipped it into a knot
Never had a pity
Broke trigger go figure
When the game gets too strong I numb it up
With a fifth of liquor
I'm cocked my glock
I wish I could the battle stick
Prince ran in my home
Had to unload the clip
Mentally confused from loves who wasn't true
Pregnant by my cousin, huh, see what they put you through
It gets deeper, like the bass in your speakers
Drink a gallon of Moet while girls solicit for sex
I was born as a rider, raised as a soldier
Now I'm thuggin', trigger-huggin', passin' food'til it's over
If you wanna come at me, you better
If you wanna come at me, you better (get down)
If you wanna come at me, you better (get down)
If you pull that, bust that,'cause you know I'm a clown
Thirty plus six, plus ounces makes a cake
That's the numbers you figure, why you booming that weight?
These junkies kill me, yo, claiming to lock the game
And you been pitching for years, they never heard their name
Plus these hoochies ain't no good, these gals ain't no good
Like systems in your ride
Been banged all through the hood
Get mad cause you twerked a friend
And then a next of kin
Pay her no mind
Tippi got the gifts her chin
If you wanna come at me you better get down
If you wanna come at me you better get down
If you wanna come at me you better get down
If you pull that bust ass cause you know I'm a clown
Good.
