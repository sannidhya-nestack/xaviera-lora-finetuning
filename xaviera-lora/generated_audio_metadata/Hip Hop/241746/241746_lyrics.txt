Dear Mr. Government, I'm kinda struggling, hustling
Tryna get this cake and not get busted man
My 9 to 5 used to pay all my bills
Now I gotta resort to chopping up crap with drug deals
I never realized this shit when I was young
When I twisted up a spliff and took a hit then I was sprung
I was always penalized for shit that I done
I was told by this old man that I would end up a bum
This is like hell
Yeah because we living in these slums
You got me walking on this third rail
Giving my all
I'm on the run from your punk-ass warrants
So please, slip'em off my back because I'm out here warrants, so now
Dear Mr. Government
We all got a dream, but it seems we still struggle in the same
It wouldn't be easy'cause we supposed to have equality
We still live our lives even though you tell us these lies (Dear Mr. Government)
He say we gon' stay on our grind'cause we got the freedom to ask why (Dear Mr. Government)
Dear Mr. Government, I'm still strugglin', musclein' (Why, why, why, why, why)
Niggas out they deck like I'm the customs man (Why, why, why, why, why)
My nine to five wasn't payin' me shit, so I quit to quit
My last check bought one of your bricks
I see them dicks you got posted in that white crown Vick
I'm like a can of oil mister cuz I'm just too slick ya dig
I'm not tryna sign up for your military
Just take a look at your own streets niggas gettin buried
We all gang bangin we all cane swangin
Just take a look at this letter ya see that I ain't playin
I'm not tryna be Mr. Bad Guy but if I can't get no help then somebody's gonna die
Yeah Mr. Government
Oh, we all got a dream but it seems
We still struggle and you say it would be easy
we supposed to have equality
Oh, we still live our lives even though
You tell us these lies but you say we gon' stay on our grind
we got the freedom to ask why
Mr. Government, my life is on the shutters, man, I'm locked up
I keep sending you letter after letter, man
And I ain't heard no answer
And I'm a serious scamster
If I ever see that copy
Gonna get held for ransom
I'm just trying to get some aid and assistance
Maybe immunity
Like you get foreigners businesses
They raising taxes on our black asses
My girl done got the cash to get me out
And since my letters don't work, it's time to sew a seam, since sew a seam
Instead I'm focused on the growth and dreams, and since my letters don't work
I'ma be heard by any means, everybody in the streets gon' start to sing
Yeah, Mr. Government (Oh, we all gotta dream in your patience)
Yeah, Mr. Government
It would be easy'cause we supposed to have equality (We ain't Mr. Government)
Oh, we still live our lives even though God only tell us these lies (We ain't Mr. Government)
He say, "We gon' stay on our grind'cause we got the freedom to ask why" (We ain't Mr. Government)
We ain't got nothing to lose, no, no, we ain't got nothing to lose
We ain't got nothing to lose, so what you think we gon' do when we ain't got nothing to lose?
