I want my hoodie back
And I ain't being bitter
You took my heart
So give it back
And I ain't being bitter
But if I'm being honest
I want my cookie back
I ain't being bitter
I ain't tryna be with you, no
I just miss your kissing
I just miss your touching
I just miss your loving
I want it bad, I want it bad
Three in the morning, why am I calling?
Scrolling through old photos, I couldn't discard them
Thinking'bout all the times that you left me lonely
Was supposed to be me and you, but now it's only me
You told me you loved me, I tried to believe it
You said that you care, but I couldn't see it
Used to be my everything, so how you go ghost on me?
Like why whenever I see you, you try so hard not to notice me
I know what you did last week
Calling your phone but I still ain't hear a peep
You and me ain't never ever been that deep
This ain't no thing in me
This ain't no thing to be
I want my hoodie back
And I ain't being bitter
No no
You took my heart
So give it back
And I ain't being bitter
But if I'm being honest, I want my cookie back
I ain't being bitter, I ain't tryna be with you, no
I just need your kissing, I just need your touching
I just need your loving, I want it back, I want it back
Long legs, long legs, pretty face
She was so bad, so bad, all in my face
Now I'm so mad that she gone, so mad that she gone
Baby girl on my mind (I want it bad)
So I put it in a song (I want it bad baby)
I know what you did last week
Calling your phone but I still ain't hear a peep
You and me never ever been that deep
This ain't no thing in me
This ain't no thing to be
I want my hoodie back
And I ain't being bitter
No no
You took my heart
So give it back
And I ain't being bitter
But if I'm being honest
I want my cookie back
I ain't being bitter
I ain't tryna be with you, no
I just miss your kissin'
I just need your touchin'
I just need your lovin'
I want it bad, I want it bad
I want my hoodie back (I just want my hoodie back)
And I ain't bein' bitter (I just want my hoodie back)
You took my heart (I just want my hoodie back)
So give it back (I just want my hoodie back)
And I ain't bein' bitter
But if I'm being honest, I want my cookie back
I ain't being bitter, I ain't tryna be with you, no
I just need your kissing, I just need your touching
I just need your loving, I want it bad, I want it bad
I ain't even worried
