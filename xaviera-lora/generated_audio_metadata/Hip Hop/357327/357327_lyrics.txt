Keith Murray buckshot, RKZ, Buck, Buck, Buckshot, the whole culture
This is dedicated to MC's, rappers, DJ's, producers, independent labels
2000 and now, peace to the god, in the earth
This is for you niggas who think it's so easy to get the record out, check it out
Keep spending your money and your hard earned paycheck
Just to hear the engineer say check, one two
Testing one two, fake video you investing in one two
8mm my heat is your precious news on your sleep button
Cause you keep frontin so I cruise through the Atlantic
Every one of my antics become antiques they keep like hammocks
One panic, I release Ben Lattin'
Been around the world, y'all ain't never leave Manhattan
Wait, I know you, you work for traffic, uptown
I seen you flaggin'em down, I start laughing
No wonder why your face look familiar
Anyway, the point is, who gives a fuck? They don't feel you?
Listen, you got to get on, get a J-O-B
And stay there, punch that fuck time clock in
You heard me? You know what to do
Pop said he catch a beat now (yeah, yeah)
Pop said he catch a beat now (uh-huh)
Pop said he catch a beat now (that's right)
Pop said he catch a beat now (uh-uh)
Pop said he catch a beat now (uh-huh)
Pop said he catch a beat now
Pop said he catch a beat
Don't front, you know I got you open
I black like the moon when I feel that notion
And labels be scoping, hoping to coax him
Into something stupid, damn they must be smoking
Talking fifty fifty nine, eighty twenty
And publishing, you can't get a damn thing from me
I work too hard, put in way too many hours
Y'all bull in and stop the smell of flowers
And I don't call that grinding
I call it wasting money in the studio rhyming
And I don't call that shinin' (uh-uh)
I think y'all n****s frontin' with the mail or the diamonds (right)
That you cop from the back of the sauce (right)
That's why when you send your demos and that n**** get lost (uh-huh)
Straight to the garbage can
My man, you should learn how to mix for you sending your n****s
Pop said he'll cut your beef down (yeah, yeah)
Pop said he'll cut your beef down (don't you et it)
Pop said he'll cut your beef down (uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pop said he'll cut your beef down
Keith Curry BDI off the check
Yo, I go H like primates, high like sauce crates
All doors locked, nobody can escape, I'm on some Eminem
Flow for 8 miles, rip an empty head off, throw it in the crowd
You can never hurt me, even if you hit me in the face with a bottle, your arms got no power
Man, y'all (bleep) funny
Sitting around wasting time counting up (bleep) money
Get some (uh)
You can never (bleep) with Keith
You ain't no stick up kid
You would sneak these beat up first to pot (bleep) get your (bleep) whip
Go right to the cops
Point me out and then snitch like
Yeah, that's him officer
He beat me down, I want him arrested
I'm yelling like this (bleep) is pathetic
You cyberspace thugs
Blog gangsters

Uh huh, yeah, you know what it is
Beatin down on punk suckas
