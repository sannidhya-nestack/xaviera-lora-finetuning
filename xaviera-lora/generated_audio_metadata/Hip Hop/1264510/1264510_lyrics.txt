Legs be rolling heavy, loud scars
Break the gates, tear down the walls, prophetic souls
Distant echoes smash the falls
Shattered screams like broken dreams
Cold disrupts the ancient schemes
Echoed screams, silence nights signing off the final screen
Ladies taking over now
Gone too far, no turning around
Static whispers, fierce and raw
Revolutionary
Re-re-re-re-re-re-rearation
The blue shark, fading lines past digital haze
Rebel hearts burn through the maze
Dance with ghosts in disarray
Rise and shine, no dawn today
Freedom calls, hard-core embrace all non-ma
Lights aflame, the truth we find
Collective power now aligned
La-la-la, oh
Ladies taking over now
Golfing fun, no turning'round
Static whispers, fierce and raw
Revolutionary how
Fading lines past digital haze
Rebel hearts burn through the maze
Dance with ghosts in disarray
Rise and shine, new dawn today
Freedom calls, we're all blind, breaks on my mind
Lights aflame, the truth we find
Collective power now aligned
Allow alone
Ladies taking over now
Gone to final turn around
Static whispers fierce and raw
Revolutionary
Ladies rolling heavy loud scars
Breaking gates tearing down the walls
Prophetic souls
Distant echo smash the fall
Shattered screams like broken dreams
Cold disrupts the ancient scenes
Echoed screams silence night
Signing off the final scream
Ladies taking over now
Gone to final turn around
Static whispers fierce and raw
Revolutionary
We we we we we we we we we we
Revolution
