Come on
God's gift
Come on, I'm with you
I'm a struggler
I'm running down
Rapping was like my first time throwing my raps
Holding my wrist folded blowing with the breath that I had
Lowering my fist back showing I'm with that
Bell rings still lunging my swings et that
Dawn King's abs on my way to be champ
Over with the blow of a soldier throwing my hands up
A victory dance is one proof to be the answer
No anthem cheering the rhythms here in my fan club
Christian living interviews and temper tantrums
Chance of a lifetime that's what they flipping
Handing me money and women
Benjamin grinning for my hitting
Spitting all out the gums with that runaround
Thinkin' Jace ever change how much money you come with
I ain't the one to fake appearance and play dumb
You can kill ass superstars shine lipstick and make up
It God's gift to say stuff for God's living greater
I train hard to maintain and make a name in skyline
The world is mine on paper
Blend form and bold print to be the champ
You gotta know to move at moments notice
Tough like Trojan silence is golden
So I told men gang from yen
Focus you will find in every book I wrote in
A smooth approach in the ways I fall when hopeless
In times of need I sit and dream and think of all this dope
How to cope with society that’s always trying me
Living the lie to me but a chance hitting the lottery
No camaraderie gotta roll solo on the side and see part of me
Parting teeth I’m just winning while thinking logically
AM’s through PM’s I ruled in every coliseum
Say my name I bet they die to beat them
Defending all my reasons
You're wet like rainy seasons
I switch the guards a minute
Roam the streets without no beefing
The full predominant check my record
No losses given
I ain't go spittin'
So when I'm stickin'
I hit like glisten
Solo vali with the quickness
There ain't no competition
Eye of a tiger
This fight has accomplished many visions
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (my soul, my soul)
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (your life, my life)
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (my soul, my life)
I got a gift from God
Reaching legendary in my own times
Barbing and weaving out enough hours in these days to keep me pay breathing
I roll all 25 overtime
So I speak older rhymes
Drinking the oaks of a villa my body golden size
There's no retreating plus no surrendering, no denying
Another rocky, rematch Apollo close your eyes
Go ahead and open wide, the greatest love of all time
The only way I lose is if I get disqualified
Still raise my hands up high, won't ever let'em down
Superiors claiming they rare breed though in the town
Must have you mistaken for all them other losers
Don't ever ever pay mind because they out to school ya
Born ruler, Barracuda chopper, she used to
Dope maneuvers, don't let the age of wave fool ya
King of the ring, while y'all pop crisps
I sip gin, sing an herbal tea on occasion, sesame
I'm young and dedicated, I have won a major gold
Don't wait for sauce to rip it, get out there and save your soul
Choose if you wanna fight, but fight if you wanna win
And if you lose, understand that that is not the end
I say defend if a challenge comes to break your spirits
I say defend, give some fuck up, no one wants to hear it
I stand firm, watch my fist clench and chest raise up
Remember the majors to these players, like Joe Frazier
Marciano, Lewis to Roy Jones
Longevity, y'all testing me, I break bones
I speak alone if ya'll wanna do something do it
Days my home find me try me do act stupid
Ya'll only hear of one God's gifted on the mic
Only one imagine what my road dogs is like
For bike call us Tyson with an appetite
At his prime I seek divine all the rest to die
Shout outs to all my dogs in the south side
Well leave ya mouth wide understand that
Understand that God's gifted
So one keeps ya rocking like
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (my soul, my soul)
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (my life, my life)
I got a gift from God and God gave me this (my soul, my life)
I got a gift from God
