Yeah, shit down, dirt move up, dirty Sanchez, yeah
Ayo Sanchez, open the gates up, then you're welcome
Interview with a night child, follow me
Let me take you down the alley to the minor that's shifty
When it gets dark and hard you need a six pack
But first you got to brace yourself for what dreams may come
I been in hell and back to juice my wealth and yet I'm still home
Think nothing will ever change that my thoughts get more intense
My methods direct contact like Michelle Pfeiffer
Give it up close and personal
Leaving local marks from this beast just to curse you
I'm dead serious still as raw as they come
Not even safe where they for us produce more radium rum
I can't be restrained who's to say what's the same
The closet filled with mascara and pain
Eat'em like the Texas chain
But y'all can keep the fame don't want the spotlight
Only focus right here
Gettin' my money real tight
Y'all can do your single note but this ain't Rick
Put the best hits in the dark
Move to the motion like the descent
We here to rip the game out the fray
So anybody in the D to move out the way (I'm out the way)
It's time to stand up for the game to change (change)
For all of y'all out there who don't know her name (who don't know my name, yeah)
It's your day, it's your day, it's your day (it's your day)
It's your day, it's your day, it's your day (it's your day, it's your day, it's your day)
It's your day, it's your day, it's your day, it' your day
I've been the game too long to give it all up
Had my real life passions been kicked to the dust
Before I let that happen I first changed my position
Bottoms up,'bout to grab this UberGids for the Christy
I flow below sea level I get down
Yet like Louisiana meant to stay on top of the ground
With the sounds I gotta stay level headed
Never mind the eager testicle at times making me dread it
I'm the one they want to market most sopper-boo, so y'all can call Shifty, yeah the crazy versatile, unlike anything official ever heard in the wild, I was defounded as a hip-hop, down to my last drop, blessed this game with everything I got
We here to rip the game out the frame
So anybody in the D to move out the way (out my way)
The time is now for the game to change (change)
For all the y'all out there who don't know her name (who don't know my name, yeah)
It's shift day, shift day, shift day (it's shift day)
It's shift day, shift day, shift day
It's shift day, yeah (it's shift day, shift day, shift day)
(It's your day, it's your day, it's your day, it' your day)
Got you sitting in your head and back for the long haul
(Chop this throne like I whip on tracks with a chainsaw)
Y'all know my work from beginning to end
End it to end, lurking crackin' skulls
Cracks in their chins, I told you before
I'll break it down, industry doors
All in doubt, I let my light shine straight to the cause
That's where you get that real love from
If it ain't genuine then that's the truth
Some throwback shit, and I don't want none
For real, y'all can go ahead and keep that
Hate on true parts, ain't gettin' it further on the map
Just slowed your progress, hope to see you wanna come up
If it's leftover after chips, overflow my cup
Double time, ain't nothin' sicker than the rhymes
At the notion, everything is truly messin' with mine
Lyrics told a hard punch, ain't no taxin' my flow
Call me Mayweather, hittin'em with them killer ass blows
We here to rip the game out the frame
So anybody in the D to move out the way (out my way)
It's time to stand up for the game to change (change)
For all the all out there who don't know the name of Shifty (who don't know the name of Shifty)
It's Shifty, it's Shifty, it's Shifty (it's Shifty)
It's Shifty, it's Shifty, it's Shifty (it's Shifty, yeah)
It's Shifty, it's Shifty, It's Shifty (it's Shifty, yeah)
It's Shifty, it's Shifty, it's Shifty (it's Shifty)
We here to rip the game out the frame
So anybody in it need to move out the way (out my frame)
The time is now for the game to change (change)
For all of y'all out there who don't know the name of Shiftee, Shiftee, Shiftee (it's Shiftee)
It's Shiftee, Shiftee, it's Shiftee (it's Shiftea, it's Shiftea)
It's your day, it's your day, it's your day, it' your day
