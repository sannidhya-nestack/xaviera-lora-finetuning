I hear the bass knock, got me under your spell
Breathing in the tension, every promise you sell
Hearts on the edge but I'm done with the chase
A queen in command stepping into my place
You told me fairy tales wrapped in heavy steel
Sparkling words so sharp left a tender wound to heal
I'm done sipping poison from your silver lies
Got a brand new focus watch me finalize
Your whispers got quiet but my mind's still loud
I'm ing my path free from your toxic crowd
Heat in my chest, can't cool it down
Got me wired, got me fired, I wear the crown
Heat in my chest, a thunderous sound
Gonna make you feel the echo all around
I used to tremble stuck in your space
Now I flow with rhythm leaving doubt no trace
No fake confessions I'm done being used
Strength in my voice I refuse to be reduced
You can watch from afar while I ascend
No more illusions, I don't have to pretend
Heat in my chest, that's the melody I claim
Heat in my chest, blazing out my name
Heat in my chest
Still roaring strong
I've known my worth
All along
Heat in my chest, still roaring strong
I've known my worth all around
