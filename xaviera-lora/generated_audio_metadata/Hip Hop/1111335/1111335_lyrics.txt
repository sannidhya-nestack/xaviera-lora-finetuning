Whipping chickens in the kitchen then gone take a nap

Gucci coat
Spice up my tour on my bitch Drayton Christian Dior
First I wake up in the morning then go count them racks
I might pull up on your main thing tell her blow me back
Whippin chickens in the kitchen then go take a nap
When it's dry they come and get it make it play like Madden
