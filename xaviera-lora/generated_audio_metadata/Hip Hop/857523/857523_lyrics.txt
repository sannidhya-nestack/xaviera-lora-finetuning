Kill your best champagne on ice (alright) we don't need to know the price (yeah) me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (yeah) kill your best champagne on ice (alright)
We don't need to know the price (yeah)
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (uh-uh)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party (uh-uh)
At least I ain't a bitch and that we all gettin' naughty (gettin' naughty)
This girl goin' wild up in the spotlight
We VIPin' tonight
Bars and Bellevue on ice
Raise your glasses up right, cheers
Obeys price
Married to the game of celebrate they throwin' rice
The Hollywood type, bait them in real life
Clash they goin' bite, stoppin' habits for a price
Hold your advice, shift and take the whole slice
It ain't a roll of dice, my takeoff rocket flight
I want it all, this how I ball up late nights
Like booty call, spread my wings, I can't fall
I'm a different breed, Zach, runnin' with pipes and knapsacks
I'm so hood, bitch, as if you didn't know that
Can't et the ice black, take'em down like all slacks
Real tuna, Nickelodeon, been a rugrat
I'm high fashion, still more popular than the Brats
Faith will check the stats to bring the hook back
We'll hang it in boutiques and bars
Dressed in Gucci just like so (yeah)
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (for the night)
Pizza and luxury combined
Blow your cash and drum on (yeah)
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (all night)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party
At least I ain't a bitch and then we all gettin' naughty
I'm in the zone just losing my mind
Know it's about time to get it cracking
Pork rinds, low profile, that's a girl still shine
Gotta wet your turn trick, you out of line
Respect the grind, you can kiss my freaking behind
Who find this wine, make these bars keep trying
No service, cremation how I kill rhymes
Reppin' that red white and blue, I'll take my time
Think I'm on a rap, how quick they switch sides
I'm on needle, drunk night then coke soda with french fries
No D-Hi, ice to keep my brain a-tide
I'm on the rise, keep your focus on the real prize
Super duper fly to rap'cause you can't buy
Watch how your every effort's straight suicide
You can come to rap, butcha open your eyes wide
The Lord by the city, come on let's ride
We are stepping out of shiny bars
These chimichus will take us far
Yeah, me and my girls we wildin' out for the night
Shuttin' down the boulevard
Armed with cash and credit cards
Yeah, me and my girls we wildin' out for the night
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party
Least I ain't a bitch and then we all gettin' naughty
Wildin' out's my ammo, nothin' I'm trained to do
I'm a work of art, you'll craft this up, your kid drew
Got Harley and my crew, mix it up, beef stew
I'm sick of the few, sellin' smooth boat crews
Stash Cubas earned a one spot, I can't lose
Here I go, ask pretty plug, I pay dues
Never come from outta nowhere
Baby clues, if hood don't know who you are then you ain't making moves
Step up your swag, whole albums are dragged through all these bitches legs
So I'm leaving round nothing but toe tags
My kills instantly, when it get eventually
They ever mention me, writing scripted in history
Spread it for centuries, can't you see they loving me?
Fans hover me, fight security to hug me
Put down my Janehead cock and the game lovely
Shit that rap poured and released some C above G's
We're gonna chase our cares away
Dance and party every day (yeah)
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night
All good things will come to you
Have a wish make it true (yeah)
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (uh-huh)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party (uh-huh)
At least I ain't a bitch and then we all gettin' naughty (gettin' naughty, gettin' naughty, gettin' naughty)
Y'all know what it be
Me and my girls we wildin' out for the night (shakin' feet, feet)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party (it's a party)
Yeah, listen, vision
Yeah, my girls, we wildin' out for the night
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party
Let's get it
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party
Least I ain't the bitches and we all gettin' naughty
