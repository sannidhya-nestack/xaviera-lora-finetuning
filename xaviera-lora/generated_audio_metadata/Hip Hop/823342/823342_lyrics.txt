Cocaine baby
Let's talk about this
Let's talk about it
She said I need to know
Girl I need to know
Bitch I'm a poet
And I know it
So I speak these words
I shattered the earth
I make it shake
Feel it quake
Hebrew built in three days
Yeah I do this all day
Talking to you all day
All day
Baby girl
Tonight you're mine
She like let's talk this out
I know there's things on your mind
That you wanna get out
I can't hold your pain, can't feel your pain (tonight girl, let me walk it out)
There's no need to talk it out, I can show you how I feel (body is all angry)
Body, body (body is all angry)
When our eyes meet, and I know, now where else you'd rather go?
Right now, right now, right now
When our eyes meet, and I know, now where else you'd rather go?
Right now, right now, right now (body)
The body is all I need, bitch (body, body, bitch)
Body's all I need, bitch (bitch)
I'm speaking body language, yeah
I'm speaking it so fluid like what I do (all that shit)
She ain't expect me to do this
Ain't like you bitch, you got my back on your backstab like Judas
Oh where your truth is? What's your soothing? Where your bruise is?
I'm from Amsterdam, where the kids have no confidence
It's just fake fronts, man it's kinda fake
So over this shit, girl
Let's get back to what matters, yeah let's make things
It's happening, baby girl, tonight you're mine
She like, let's talk this out
I know there's things on your mind
That you wanna get out (get out)
I can't watch your thing (can't)
Tonight girl, let me walk it out
There's no need to talk it out
I can show you how I feel (body is a language)
Body, body
When our eyes meet and I know, now where else you rather go?
Right now, right now, right now
When our eyes meet and I know, now where else you rather go?
Right now, right now, right now
Body
Your body is our language (body, body)
Body is our language
I know you wanna be
Anywhere but here
But you're here with me
And life ain't fair
But we control our destiny (language)
My flow like the giving tree
Wisdom preaching the prophecy
Who you need the one and only
Identity crisis poetry
Viewers holding me back
When I was playing cold back
Mentality didn't get to the rack
Full up step back
That's cash don't get me
That no pity you a fool but I can see
We have no faith in my craft
I'm 3D limited and deluxe
New breed even parents fear me
Baby girl
Baby girl you fear me
You're being me, I know you're feeling me
So baby girl, tonight you're mine
Eyes are still shining
