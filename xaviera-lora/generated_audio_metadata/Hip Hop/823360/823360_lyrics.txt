This is a confession session
So just breathe in deep
Take that last sip slow
You gon need all of these memories
If that's the truth you've been sipping on
Please don't spill any
Because when I'm done with you
You'll be addicted to me
Wanna join my family
Get you a branch up on my tree
Spirit free like a lucid dream
I know but
My mind is so gone, my girl is loco, need to put it in a song
MJ, LeBron, Kobe or Frodo, yeah we all after those rings
Forever chasing glory, these conversations are simple
Plus you so difficult, got my back to the ropes and I can't
Abandoned principles, yeah I know what I said ain't the same as what I did
But if you ask iveness, he will give it
It's you I've been missing, it ain't true, I ain't slipping
If anything, I just readjusted balance, I'm the prospect, no one's scouting
Break that up, twist it slow, light it up, we both know where we going next
This is a confession
Session
Wanna tell you everything in a confession session
So break that up, twist it slow, light it up
We both know where we goin'
Next, this is a confession session
Wanna tell you everything in a confession
So just breathe in deep
Inhale that last hit slow, let your mind
Teach you lessons, feel the vibe in this session
Have a confession then just make it
Better to keep a promise than to break it
Thank you Captain, obvious
Better to have love than not at all
And that's not at all false, so count your blessings
I never been overseas, never been through depression
Made it through a sickness, I call it sunlight though
Why these fools used to hate on me cause my
Thought probably mad cause I could take your girl
Shook the world and you gone
Like five minotes literally took too long
I'm like six foot long ahead of y'all
I ain't even like to race but it's the home stretch
So I'll make the pace no need to stall
If you girl thirsty I'm the beverage
I'm never hesitant the exception
So just go back to wherever you came from
If it doesn't feel the same just let me know let me know
Cause we could go
We could do this today we could go
We could do this today
Just break that hub, twist it slow
Light it up, we both know when we going next
This is a confession session
Wanna tell you everything in a confession session
So break that hub, twist it slow
Light it up, we both know when we going next
This is a confession
Session
Wanna tell you everything in a confession
