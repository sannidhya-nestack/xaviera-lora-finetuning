We all wake up in the same crazy town
Gotta find a way to get up so you don't end up down
Times are hard money is tight can't buy no gas
Seems like everything we never wanted is here to last
We're gonna make it through this time
We're gonna find a way
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna be strong
And it won't take long
I believe we deserve everything in the world
The perfect life
The perfect love
The perfect girl
Don't be careful what you wish for
Dream big, live life
And always hope for more (It's gonna come around)
We're gonna make it through this time
We're gonna find a way, we're gonna turn it around
We're gonna be strong, and it won't take long
We're gonna make it through this time
Everything you need and every time you bleed
It's gonna come around
Believe it's gonna come around
We're gonna make it through this time
We're gonna find a way
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna be strong
And it won't take long
We're gonna make it through this time
Everything you need
And every time you bleed
It's gonna come around
Believe it's gonna come around
Gonna come around, yeah
Gonna come around
Well everyday we get another chance
To breathe, to give, to get up and dance
Well one day we might rule the world
And we'll all be dancing
With the perfect girl
We're gonna make it through this time
We're gonna find a way
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna be strong
And it won't take long
We're gonna make it through this time
Everything you need and every time you bleed
It's gonna come around
Believe it's gonna come around
We're gonna make it through this time
We're gonna find a way
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna be strong
And it won't take long
We're gonna make it through this time
Everything you need and every time you bleed
It's gonna come around
Believe it's gonna come around
Come around
Believe
Believe
Come around
You wanna come around?
