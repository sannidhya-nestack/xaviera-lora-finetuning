Sometimes I just sit around and I'll be thinking'bout
All the things in my past, how they trickled down
All the pains in our memories are with us now
They just ripple down, and though little now
They add up, tug hard, try to rip you down
So your eyes through the dust get lifted now
Though not always the life I requested
I try to make the best and I shine like a prism now
Never knew love until it came into my life
Now I'm as free as I can be
Never knew change until it came into my life
Now I am free and I can see
I know that road let me know where
And the goals that I hold seem so far away
I cried a thousand times
It only made me stronger'cause I know
Never knew love until it came into my life
Now I'm as free as I can be
Never knew change until it came into my life
Now I am free and I can see
When every lesson's eclipsed by a mess
Then questions arise, how many times will I be tested?
I don't know and I don't care because right now
First time in a long while, not only can I write now
But I can stand in the booth and recite now
To get up on stage and engage and ignite crowds
And I can play with my nephew and my niece
And I can run around the block and come back in one piece
I can do what I do if I can breathe and while I'm breathing
Believe me I'll scream on these beats
But if I disappear again and you don't hear from me
You can probably guess what happened, ain't no mystery
And this song will be the proof of a time
Where the sooth in the booth went and made his mark on history
Never knew love until it came into my life
Now I'm as free as I can be
Never knew change until it came into my life
Now I am free and I can see
I know things get hard
But I know we'll fight even harder (things get tougher)
I know things get hard (so what we do)
But I know we'll fight even harder (we gotta fight)
I know things get hard (we gotta hold our heads high)
But I know we'll fight even harder
I know things get hard (you can't deny how far I've come)
I know we'll fight even harder
Never knew love until it came into my life (never knew love)
Now I'm as free as I can be (free)
Never knew change until it came into my life (oh)
Now I am free and I can see (I can see)
