Don't get caught, you can do what you gotta do, don't get caught, life, don't get caught
You can do what you gotta do (yeah, uh, yeah, uh)
You can do your thing homeboy but don't get caught
Whether you flippin' that white or holdin' that Glock
Pumpin' trees on the block or you tokin' that rock
When the D's and the cops all got you on watch
Next thing you know, them boys will raid your spot
And hang you big time like Mr. Flater's clock
Headin' up north, losin' everything you got
From your cars to your house to your rings and watch
you sold to them cats you didn't think was jakes
And now you look at it all as a joke
A big mistake how you didn't hesitate
To sell a half a brick of yay
Now you facing six to eight
Just for trying to get some cape
Ain't that some shit
But that's how the jakes work
Giving us these bricks
Then they summoned us to state court
So before you go ahead
And try to make more think
How much dough is catching a case worth
Shh, them cat be cooking
Lies, don't get caught
You can do what you gotta do
Don't get caught
Life, don't get caught
You can do what you gotta do, don't get caught
