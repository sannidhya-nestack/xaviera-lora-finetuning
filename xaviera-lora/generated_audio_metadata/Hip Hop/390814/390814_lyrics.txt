Yo, man, positive, this can't be happening yo, this can't be for real dawg
What's that, doctor, repeat it again
You said it's positive and my life's finna end
Fuck that, this can't be happening to me
I'm too damn young to have HIV
I might've caught it from Sharon
She draws the black LeBaron
Lisa, Teresa, or maybe it was Karen
I wonder did I pass or did I give it to someone
Was it passed from birth from my girl to my son
Oh no I got a looker in the eye
I got HIV and this means I finna die
Wait mommy don't you cry
Please try to understand
It wasn't supposed to happen wasn't part of my plan
A freak by nature I love hitting skins
Ran train on parlor with a couple of my friends
That night my condom broke
I thought it was a joke
I said put it in your mouth take it way down your throat
What peoples don't know is you can catch it from the orals
Living life recklessly with no kind of morals
A pimp, a player, a baller, a mack
But once you get eight son there's no turning backs
I can't believe I put myself in this position
KRS tried to warn me I wish I would've listened
Stop what you're doing it's time to state the facts
Before you hit the road man you better be strapped
Cause now when winter AIDS attacks
You better run out and get you a Jimmy Hadd
Stop what you're doing it's time to state the facts
Before you hit it raw man you better be strapped
Cause now when winter AIDS attacks
You better run out and get you a Jimmy Had
Sick from this shit and there is no cure
The friends that I have they don't know me anymore
I drink water at they house they break the glass when I leave
My moms in denial she's refusing to believe
That soon I'll meet my maker how long will it take her
To understand I'm at my rapture like I need the baker
Cast out of heaven, God took away his grace
I woke up this morning, had a lesion in my face
At night I can't sleep, my body soaking wet
Tossing and turning, my bed's full of sweat
I lost fifty pounds, wasn't even on a diet
Before you hit it raw, I suggest don't even try it
I'm telling you the deal, age shit is real
In nine out of ten, all it's going to do is kill
With no discrimination, no hesitation
If you're white, black, Puerto Rican, every nation
It costs so little for a pack of three
You better wear your hats
Stop what you doing, it's time to state the facts
Before you hit the broad man you better be strapped
Cause now in winter AIDS attacks
You better run out and get you a Jimmy Had
Stop what you doing, it's time to state the facts
Before you hit the broad man you better be strapped
Cause now in winter AIDS attacks
You better run out and get you a Jimmy Had
Bet you heard a Dina Howard song, a freak like me
But you never heard a jam about the HIV
Now stop what you doing, I suggest you pay attention
Easy E, Magic Johnson, it's just a few dimension
But you don't hear me though, you think it can't happen
I'm a wack nigga rappin'cause I ain't about gun clappin'
I know you like it raw, but brother stop and think
That pussy might be good but your life could be extinct
I still can't believe we like back in the day
Thinking AIDS is manmade and it only affects gays
Stop all the madness, end the confusion
You saw a blood transfusion
The third way is sex nigga
Even if you straight fuck around and catch the hiv
You bound to meet your mate
Before you go inside or rock your rough riders
Like 9-7 to local bodegas
Your supplier, it cost so little for a pack of three
There's Jimmy Hats by BDP
Remember you're never too old (yo just give me one more chance)
You better pack your hats (yo the A's shit is real dawg)
Remember you're never too old (you gon lose my life man)
You better wear your hats (they at restaurants and tell me about their shit)
Before you hit your dorm and it's time to state the facts (you remember that song?)
You better go and get you a Jimmy hat (about Jimmy hats)
Cause now in winter A's are taxed (to M to I to J)
So go out and get you a Jimmy hat (to M to J to I to M)
It's Jimmy (remember you're never too old)
Hold up it's Jimmy (you better pack your hats)
Hold up Jimmy
