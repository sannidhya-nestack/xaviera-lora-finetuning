Yeah, yeah, feeling fresh, feeling fine
Watch me blossom, yeah, yeah
Woke up today with color in my view
Used to feel so gray, now I'm breaking through
Something's made my heart, gave me something new
I'm learning who I am, staying honest and true
I stroll down the sidewalk with a brand new glow
Music in my headphones let the rhythm flow
No fear in my breath let my confidence show
I'm cool in my lane keep it steady and slow
I'm a wild bloom flowers in my mind
Growing in my own way not a cloud to find
Petals spreading wide let my spirit unwind
Wild bloom yeah I'm feeling so defined
Wild bloom wild bloom wild bloom
Can you feel the shine
Wild bloom, wild bloom, in this heart of mine
I sip my morning tea, watch the shadows fade
Dancing in my mirror, this is how I'm made
Colors in my words, every step I upgrade
No regrets on my path, loving each escapade
Calling up my girls, got a vibe to share
Laughing'til we cry, never stuck in despair
Moments form a mosaic that we all can wear
Feeling blossoms of joy, sweet as summer air
I'm a wild bloom
Wild bloom, flowers in my mind
Growing in my own way, not a cloud to find
Petals spreading wide, let my spirit unwind
Wild bloom, yeah I'm feeling so defined
No more walls blocking how I feel inside
Vibin' colors swirl whenever I decide
I let my heart lead, let the worries subside
Wild bloom energy, it's too bright to hide
Wild bloom, wild bloom
Can you feel the shine?
Wild bloom, wild bloom in this heart of mine (ay, ay)
Wild bloom, wild bloom coming through (breathing)
All that's true, watch me flourish in everything I do
Yeah, yeah, all gone
Coming through, breathing, all that's true
Watch me flourish in everything I do
La la, la la, ah, ah
Wah-boom, wah-boom
Can you feel the shine?
Wah-boom, wah-boom
In this heart of mine (woah-oh, woah-oh)
Can you feel the shine (can you feel the shine) (woah-oh, woah-oh)
In this heart of mine
Yeah, coming through
