If haters want some, come get some
It's me, inflicting fear, watch you breathe heaven
Say my name out consequences, can you bleed heaven
To lose, I already lost so there's nothing left
So I'ma fight to the end
Nah, my last breath throwing blows
Causing casualties like I was throwing bullets
No need to reload, cock back, I have more bullets
I like it hard
The time I tend to let down my guard then I hate it hard
Confusing, I don't know where to start
I never give a four steam ahead until I blow up or throw up
Or until the world get tore up
Let's celebrate the omega when we make the world blow up
Making haters hold up, run up, get fold up
So if haters want some, tell them come get some
They might win that some but lose at this one
Others tried and they lost and got none
So come and get some, you're always welcome
Your rise to the top it won't last long
Do drive by with a microphone
I'll root your residence and make it my home
Watch me cut this chick and I leave her wide open
Me all down her throat and, uh, commence to choking
I'm not joking, I'm pimping
So much money out this mic
She may be a dyke, realizing this is what she like
So we can fight throughout your shoulders
Showed another no love
Run up, get swole up
Haters, get some
