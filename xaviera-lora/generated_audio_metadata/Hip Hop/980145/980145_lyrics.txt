Tonight let's get this over with and done
Cause you the one, bear my daughter
Set of twins, another daughter
Plus two sons, I'm so blessed that I gotta get
And yo my baby she be calling me a hood thing
Let's keep the home fire burning
Others they be learning how this L-O-V-E thing go
You and me we be like bingo
Met with no strings yo
Attached perfect match
You the perfect catch
Beautiful and stacked
Legs silky with the creamy thighs
Creamy eyes
I slipped into a comatose state
And you walked by
Froze when you said hi
Smile mind tricked me
Jedi
Had me begging the force
Be with me yet I
Buckled my seatbelt for the ride through your galaxy
The queen of the universe for you I hunger
Plus I thirst, first things first
I know you're worth, proverbs 3110
I got the magic potion, get it in (slow motion)

Fascinated when you rock that fascinator play dog
Wall smooth like I wasn't moved at all
Kept my pride bent up inside of me like you ain't fly to me
But truthfully who would I be if I could lie to me
I'm choking off your smoke love you got me high I'm smoked up
This gangsta loving we got peter bombed glad we loc'd up
It's me and you against the world all I need in this world
Plus this life of sin
It's me and my girlfriend
Let's get this paper baby
Flip this paper baby
Pull a caper baby
If they bag us
I'ma plead out
They won't take my baby
Hold you D like it's supposed to be
You be the most of me

Never question my loyalty queen
Death before dishonor
Take a charge and do a bid for you
Guilty of honor
