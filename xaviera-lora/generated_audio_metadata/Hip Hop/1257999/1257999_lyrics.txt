Bounce, when it go down
Bounce, my machine said keep it bold
Keep it high, let it roll
When I bounce down
Touch the sky, reach the top
Feel it, break it down, break it down
Bounce down, let it go
Make it high, make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul
Never grow old, don't lose control
Through the night'til the dawn, keep it strong
Exhaust all your fears, bounce back now
In the rhythm find your spark in the sound
Leave a mark, feel the bass through your feet
Let the world feel your beat
Bounce, bounce, let it go
Make it high, make it slow
Feel the strength in your soul
Never grow old, don't lose control
In the rhythm find your spark, in the sound leave a mark
Feel the bass on your feet, let the world feel your beat
Bounce bounce let it go, make it high make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul never grow old never lose control
Bounce, bounce, let it go, make it high, make it flow
Feel the strength in your soul, never grow old, don't lose control
