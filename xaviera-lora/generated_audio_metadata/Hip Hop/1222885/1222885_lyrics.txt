It ain't a problem, it's my job son
Sweep the streets clean, rinse it up, keep it lean
There's players in the frame, up in the game
Thinking things'll change but it's still the same, uh
Still about gats and rocks, hoes, pips, beefs and smoking glocks
There's always time to fall on your face, what?
Always someone to erase, yeah
You might think that you can hunt me down
Steal my juice, uh, wear my crown
But in the end you'll find the funk
Smoked out face down in my trunk
If you're moved to my plan
Things'll work out fine, turn out grand
If everything works to my design
We'll all be down and it's still all mine
It ain't a problem, it's my child's son
Sweep the streets clean, rinse it up, keep it lean
There's players in the frame, up in the game
Thinking things have changed but it's still the same, uh
Still about gaps and rocks, hoes, pimps, beefs and smoking glops
There's always time to fall on your face, what?
Always someone to erase, yeah
