D-d-d-d-d-d-dance (D-d-d-d-d-d)
Yeah, you can see that look in my eye
Ain't gonna stop anytime soon
Wrote a whole new book while I cry
Me and my team all flowers to bloom
Can't stop'til we reach the sky
We the type to play on the clouds
Sing to the moon, meet the sun real soon
Our thunder'bout to boom
Dancing with lightning
For some may seem frightening
We find it exciting
To dance in the lightning
Dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-d-d-d-d-dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-d-dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Light strikes, darkness ignites
Karma bites, new days, new nights
Take action, seek sight
We are gonna win this fight
I'll die for the wrongs, get right
And you better believe that everybody's gonna be alright
Dancing with lightning
For some may seem frightening
We find it exciting to dance in the lightning
Dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-d-d-d-dance, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
D-d-dance, oh, oh
The sun's fire, pounds in our heart
Every target hit with our love dart
Measure this, we above chart
Treasure this, we could win smart not average
See we invent, unsavage with our intent
Rain falls, wash away, owl's call
Better prepare on the lair for a whole new day
Dancing with the lightning
For some may seem frightening
We'll find out
Exciting to dance in the lightning
Dance, tick tick dance
Tick tick tick tick dance
Tick tick dance
And when you feel it, don't conceal it
Screaming bliss, you were it
Peace to God and Goddess
Seek calm amid fits
Realize the cosmic trick
We are bread as slaves in a prism
Open your mind to the system
We all been dead and spinning
Get off the box to the prison
Ain't nobody got time for you to just sit there wishing
Dancing
With lightning I am dancing
With lightning you are dancing
With lightning we are dancing, dancing, dancing
D-d-d-d-d-dance (oh oh oh oh)
D-d-d-dance (oh oh)
D-d-d-d-d-dance (oh oh oh oh)
D-d-d-dance (oh oh oh oh)
Let's frequency match
Are you into that?
Read my mind from the past
I recreated new facts
Can you feel my pulse?
My body is your map
Let go what's false
Next I'll cocoon with your rap
