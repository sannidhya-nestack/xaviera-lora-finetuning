My fault, I didn't mean to snap like this
I didn't mean to make the track clap like this
I'm tryna see myself seven figure it up with a better way to get a buck
I'm tired of bagging up my fault
I didn't mean to move so swiftly
I was always taught to move quickly now y'all can't get rid of me
I'm tryna get my music out to you peoples that's in need of that real music
Tweaking that suit I'm speaking to
I didn't mean to cause no problems but
If you want some trouble we can go on and solve em
All I wanna do is make hot tracks with fat stacks
Write real raps I'm coming for your spot so you can kill that
Here's the reason why I'm writing these rhymes
I'm trying to keep myself sane without committing no crimes
I feel like a immigrant from Mexico
I'm looking at this check and I'm getting paid pesos
I ain't really mean to get in the business
But I need a slot so now I'm coming to get it
I'm sick of these rappers copying equipment like they music be hitting
But all alone these niggas late where they pissing
Look homie my fault
I ain't mean to pull up and get bitches
But I got a rod that's gonna reach for the fishing
I'm teaching you playa because your baby mama sleep with a player
Cause you ain't there to get it bitch no attention
Look homie my fault
ot to introduce myself
It's Mac Tiller with a doobie hoodie who on my belt
I took the tool off the shelf
My notebook pad and pen so I can go cook fast in the kitchen
And spit it like clean dishes
Get with it like three wishes
Come get it so you could say you hit it like we trippin'
I'm on the mission never sitting around
I gotta keep that mic ripping while I'm sipping that brown
I gotta keep this split burning they be fitting a crown
For the new king plus I gotta lick on them pounds
I see you got that music all in your speakers like I'm the Tiller feature
Got these rock rappers they taking heavy breathers
It's the reason why I'm writing these rhymes
I'm trying to keep myself sane without committing no crimes
I feel like an immigrant from Mexico
I'm looking at this check and I'm getting pay pay so (my fault)
I ain't really mean to get in the business
But I need a slot so now I'm coming to get it
I'm sick of these rappers copping equipment like they music be hitting
But all alone these niggas late where they pissing
Look homie my fault
I ain't mean to pull up and get bitches
But I got a rod that's gonna reach for the fishing
I'm teaching you playa because your baby mama sleep with a player
Cause you ain't there to get it bitch no attention
Look homie my flow ain't my fault
That your girl like the way that I move way that I walk
She like the way that I talk but I be brushing her off
See I gotta keep my mind on the money get paid get rich like Bill Gates
Real cake demonstrate my mission to rise in this competition
I'm striving to get ahead in these life and times
Writing a brighter rhyme giving my praise to God
Giddy sun rays I rise to the occasion and vibe
Quarter hour show time live
Ride to this shit better get in where you fitting or you gon fold the hand
One step can lead to a lifetime of pain
You better get up on your game, man, never stay the same, man
You can switch the game up but I'm never gon' change, man
You can ask anybody that know me, they say the same thing
Mac-T, Lode, Dillian, Tweak do the damn thing
Platinum Plus Underground on the stain, the stain
I ain't really mean to get in the business
But I need a slot so now I'm coming to get it
I'm sick of these rappers copying equipment like they music be hitting
But all alone these niggas late where they pissing
Look homie my fault
I ain't mean to pull up and get bitches
But I got a rod that's gonna reach for the fishing
I'm teaching ya playa because ya baby mama sleep with a player
Cause you ain't there to get it bitch no attention
Look homie my fault
