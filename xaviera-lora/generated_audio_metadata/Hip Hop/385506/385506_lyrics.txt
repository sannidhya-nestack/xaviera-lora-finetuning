Peace
Yeah
Once again (Say Jazzy) (Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh)
(Say Jazzy) yes yes ya (Say Jazzy)
A lot of people say I'm wasting my time plus all of my talents
But I'm steady making joints so their point is not valid
So unless you're in my shoes I suggest you stay silent
Cause I'm a calm collected cat with a tendency to get violent
But yo that's not the way that I prefer to handle business
I've been dealing with some cats that claim to have my best interest
If that's the case then
Why your heart can be something relentless
Dealing with y'all could be worse than going to the dentist
And man that's not the way it should be
Or maybe it should it mixed emotions got me following instincts
Like Cuba Gooding and I know deep down what I feel is what I feel
And what I feel is real to me it's hard to keep it concealed
But I do forsake a argue and I hold it inside
Minding we minding we need to holla and like swallow our pride
This is a ride we plan to take on until we die
And if you with us then stand by our side and say jazz addicts
Say Jazzy (huh huh huh huh huh huh huh)
Say Jazzy (huh huh huh huh huh huh)
Say Jazzy (huh huh huh huh huh huh huh)
A lot of people doubt me, speaking evil out they mouthpiece
Saying I don't spend enough time with rhymes, so now I'm all about beats
Yeah I can vouch for that, steady broke with no loot
Cause I've been shelling out for wax, be checking in my house
The stacks of vinyl, final releases, textpressings and such
I get a rush, erupt like a vinyl over lush
When the vinyl's in my clutch, I find them vital so I light em up like fire
All day and night, my people lining up to hear the sounds of the three man band, eight man crew
I hold my own, anyone on my clique, yo they can too
As individuals, we define rhyme and climb to the pinnacle
Every line of mine shines till you find that I'm invisible
Refined criminals even take time to rewind syllables
I combine spirituals with sublime lyricals and divine miracles
You never find feeling through rhyme, I deliver you, yo
The feeling is true, I know y'all feel it too, it's jazz status
(Fuck the fuck, fuck the fuck)
Say Jah say (Fuck the fuck, fuck the fuck)
(Fuck the fuck, say Jah say)
(Fuck the fuck, fuck the fuck)
(Fuck the fuck, say Jah say)
A lot of y'all don't really understand the feeling I get
When it's time to spit and Rags comes in with a scratch to match his sick
We have the gift to resurrect the b-boy classic shit
Y'all haven't fit to this ridiculous shit
I'm passionate and naturally this has to be
Packed down to the generation soon to come after me
But things changed drastically so we wild
Just gradually it turned to a tragedy
It was sad but I felt it was something we all had to see
Personally I was affected dramatically
I almost laughed at me my family was backin' me
Now the torch been passed to me and I accept happily
So like a dashing athlete I use my track to speak
Half these sweet wanna be tough guys be rappin' weak
I tell'em all to have a seat as we conduct this masterpiece
Showin' some masterpiece, showin' some masterpiece
Showin' some masterpiece, showin' some masterp -<|25.16|>
