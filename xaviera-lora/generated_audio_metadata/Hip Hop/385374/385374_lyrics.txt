Toma ya aquí, aquí estoy con mis homies
Y pa' ti esta canción directamente, pum, en tu cabeza
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me ofongo a buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangría
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ría
All my homies they be slingin' a rock show
And them honeys blazin' up in the spot show
All the niggas drop-toppin' a block show
Hey yo, step into the spot, strobe light, steady spinning
Spot this dime piece, dressed up in silk, white linen
First approach, how you doing? What's your name? No convo, go back down
Reject the game, second step, same spot, no girl to be found
Oh well, might as well keep walking around
Then it hit me
Damn right in front of my eyes
Five six jet black hair and caramel thighs
Last chance last call for alcohol was made
Step to her with two glasses of alize
She's all into it acting like she wasn't
By the way who you here with?
You here with your cousin?
The vibe was cool it's about to be on
Won't you grab your coat yo
And let me take you home she said cool
Let me tell my peeps I'm leaving what and you know
Her cousin the girl I hit last weekend?
Tengo plata y me ofongo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangría
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ría
All my homies they be slinging them rocks yo
And them honeys blazing up in the spots yo
All the niggas drop top in the block yo
Kenny Pearl hotbox in the box yo
Now I'm dipping in the ride to ride to Crescent
Where to see my homie Nate Cole
Crippin' the walk you see ya
Dig this ball like bounce skate rock
Until we hoppin' off the block
Kocock the killin' county cops
It's in the city of South Central L .A.
Where homies like to grill and party and kick the foreplay
To camaradas and hiders that get the groove on
Move on, don't note just get your cool on
It's out the fridge for 40 ounce the O .E. Schlitz
Malt liquor to St. Ives and long drinks
To my homies with Cadillacs and pump thrills
Three wheel rollin' with gold ribs and candy pearls
You know it's on to hot spots and port flicks
Night clubs runnin' and trick hoes to jock shit
Niggas come to rub a whiz but double down
Dragonflies clubbin' it's on so get the chronic out
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangría
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ría
All my homies they be slingin' them rocks, yo
And them hunnies blazin' up in the spots, yo
All the niggas drop top in the blocks, yo
Kenny Pearl hotboxin' the Fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me ofongo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangria
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ria
All my homies they be slingin' them rocks yo
And them honeys blazin' up in the spots yo
All the niggas drop-droppin' a block show
Kenny Pearl hotboxin' a fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
