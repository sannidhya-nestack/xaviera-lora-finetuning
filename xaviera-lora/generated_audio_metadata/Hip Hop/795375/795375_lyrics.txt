Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie you can take a toe
Yeah I drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah all through the week, great goose in Hennessy
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie you can take toe
You gotta drink
Smoke, smoke and drink, yeah all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
I smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Split from the club with some chick I don't know
Moving slow-mo, sitting pretty on some low pros
Most hoes sniff coke by the boatload
Get'em home, won't be anywhere they won't go
With a swollen nose, hopes of getting bulldozed
Don't sniff but I'd rather blow smoke
Get drunk then bust in a ho's throat
I can drink, smoke and be broke as fuck
I'll be up in the club before it opens up
And I'm low
Joke in a freestyle circle
G's got tree, got green, got purple
And if that's the case, give that shag a taste
And if anybody hit it, they gon' have to pay
So what the problem is?
Either y'all pitchin' in or y'all finna splint, smoke, drink
Drink and smoke, put a couple on that homie, you can take a toe
Yeah, drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah, all through the week, great goose and Hennessy
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie, you can take toe
Gotta drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah, all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
I'm a hood fella, baby, yeah, I do it my way
Put a couple drinks in me, now it's time to parlay
Hit the block with my chick, she a dime for sure
And the keys right over'cause it's time to go
Time to roll with the homies, shit, I'm out for the night
Hop up in the whip and pass the ball up to the right
Pull up at the light, twenty-six is still spinning
Caddy like a spaceship dipping
Budweiser tipping, got a fifth of grape juice
Grab a cup, fill it up, a little bit of juice
Got me getting loose, hit the club for show
Gee whizzlin' is bitch, better cuff your hoes
to stub your toes and I ain't stepping on your shit
You the type of talking I'm the type to empty loops
Quit playing games, one bitch is enough
You ain't hitting this shit if you ain't pinch on the blunt
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie, you can take a toe
Yeah, I drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah, all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie, you can take a toe
Gotta drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah, all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
Feelin' lackadaisy, quick past the fragrance
That ash amazement, who's fast to blaze it?
Take a long drag and save it
With my comrades contact in the basement
We on that today shit
Living each second
Stay motivated with the herbal beauty essence
Complex and veteran
It comes to getting blown
You can get it how you want
Draw off of some jokes
It ain't no going wrong
Throw some Henny in the cup
Raw dog like it straight
No tampering my buzz
What it was what it is homie tell me what it be
Hopefully some bubbly
And a couple double D's
I can cuddle up a twin and get nice all night
With plenty drinking dro just to keep y'all tight
For that red eye flight
Come and take a ride with some spool operators from that Midwest side
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie you can take a toad
Yeah drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah all through the week grey goose and hennessey
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke
Put a couple on that homie you can take toad
Gotta drink, smoke, smoke and drink
Yeah all through the week grey goose and hennessey
Drink, drink and smoke, put a couple on that homie you can take a toe
Yeah drink, smoke, smoke and drink, yeah all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
Smoke, drink, drink and smoke, put a couple on that homie you can take a toe
Gotta drink, smoke, smoke and drink, yeah all through the week, Grey Goose and Hennessy
