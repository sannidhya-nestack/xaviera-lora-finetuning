Ayyo cut back the breaks to freak lines that blast jazz tunes
It's the words, don't switch the scoop from here to any state
I shake shit up, I'm here to impress a yo so never step to this
Or catch'em like the rest
102 Theta, number one creator
Slip into the mix and take a picture with your beta
So check out the flicks
Get hip throwin' a strip up the vibes
JBL signed through the rise
Kick man's fusions, jumpers, no illusions
Suckers out there wear too much, we could do this
yo, I'm off them all I checks I get your hoes
And tell your moms, tell your people
they'll be knowin' rocket show
So yo, I won't think twice about what jam in a second
You know the style is Jeff, so check it (This is some shit, Jack)
I'm out there with the stagger, I'm all that, I'm hip, I'm hip like Mick Jagger
Dead over school, like camera action, we're on, forever JBL, cause we coming off strong
Pick up the deck, pull out the broom, it's a mess
It's that ring, boom, sabat, the mode ways you expect above the roof
It's title to the vocal specs, so stamina, stamina, hey hey
I can't admit you see the grime is hopeless, piss a hundred percent
So catch the drift, power muff like nap
You're fine hittin' smoke if you're sneak in the shaft
Things are gettin' bad, uh huh, packin' in fact, uh huh
The local like a motor stickin' wheels on tracks
As dirty as it is, but this is mint and grime
I roll with the twenties, flipping niggas and dimes
I play the hard D's, so get off the must grab
Stay tuned to 88,'cause 88 play mad dash
I take a big step, flash like X-Press
I smoke cigar for a few cigarettes
So who know, hey, do you know, et it
I'm all full of credit, I squeeze like a headache
I never got stuck'cause I'm all shook up
These chests a pop when I push the pushups
My pants can almost sag, take more pulls than a drag
I'm smaller than Einstein but sneakier (sneakier)
Man yeah, like that and grind
Now we're getting down to the Nip-T-Free City (uh)
Now we're getting down to the Nip-T-Free City
Now he's getting deeper, deeper like a shack
Call me Grim Reaper cause I made you walk the plank in the sea of sharks
Slam like storks in the garden cause I'm hard
That is hell
Libra the logo
Silent but deadly
I'ma rock steadily
Whistle my medley
Toot my own horn
Cause I got it going on
I'm coming on strong
Like hardcore porn
The dirt
The juice
The grit make mud
I never shoot thugs like Elmer Fudd
I never drink blood
Cause what I like about you's nothing
So I gotta doubt you scrubs
The jazz be better
L to the letter
Latin to win
Tell'em what's happening
That's something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that' something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that's something to deal with, that's something to deal with
I'm going down now
