Cause I love the way you walk every time that we talk
Makes me love again on second thoughts
I really don't know what I should do, do
Cause when we break apart you always say it's my fault
But believe things change and when I get into this game
Everything will be okay sweet loving all day
Baby just me and you
I think I wanna take this closer
People change when they get a little older
So let's walk with my hand over your shoulder
And I'ma keep you warm when them nights get colder
Cause I love the way you sit back looking all pretty
With your hair pulled back and your lips all gritty
I think I fall in love again with you
Fall in love again with you
And I love the way you cross your legs
With those high heels on
The sun shines on them all day long
I think I'll fall in love again with you
I think I'll fall in love again with you
As heralds our angels sing for you every pitch
That's daddy's little girl but little mama's a witch
She got her mama lips, mama hips, mama swift
And she act like she don't like me when she knows I'm so fly with it
How can I not love you when I'm so mesmerized by your walk and your talk
How can I not love you when I got it forever in my mind will never pass?
Lady you ain't gotta like me if you love me
I hate how like you always looking pretty lovely
You so fine fine you messing with my world
So where you goin' stinky booty little girl
Cause I love the way you sit back lookin' all pretty
With your hair pulled back and your lips all gritty
I think I'll fall in love again with you
I think I'll fall in love again with you
And I love the way you cross your legs with those high heels
On the sunshine zone'em all day long
Think I'll fall in love again with you
I think I'll fall in love again with you
