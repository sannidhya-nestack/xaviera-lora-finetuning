That day you came into my life, girl you left me hypnotized
(Hypnoa, Hypnoa)
Now every time I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind
(In my mind, yeah, in my mind, yeah)
when I saw you the first time
Girl, you left me hypnotized
(Hypnotized)
(Hypnoa, Hypnoa)
And even when I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind
(In my mind, yeah, in my mind, yeah)
First time that I saw you, you was just eighteen
Now you're Jordan, you're twenty three
Cali girl, you mean, a beach skin mami
Very rare to see, sun rising on the west side
And you laid up with me, little Betty, I survived, yeah
Scootin' up in my ride, yeah, I put on all my ice, yeah
Fair sense, you look nice, I'm tryna put you on some flights
Places you never been that you like
Your life, yeah
You was rocking on saints till I put you in on Saint Laurent baby
I don't really care bout your past what y'all done who am I to judge baby
When we link up drink up you a real fun fun time
But when I close my eyes my mind gets paralyzed
That day you came into my life girl you left me hypnotized
(Hypno, hypno)
Now every time I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind
(In my mind, yeah, in my mind)

Girl, you left me hypnotized (hypnotized)
Hypno, hypno
And even when I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind
In my mind, yeah
Ain't no debating, no denying
You the baddest in the room
Baby girl you loud
Tryna take you to midtown
Take you all around
So these haters all can see you
They gonna try to put you down
But don't you ever hide your cries
You're my favorite view
Love your attitude
Everywhere I go all I do is see you
I think I'm seeing two
You give me deja vu
In my dreams I see previews of me and you
My mind is fried
I'm mesmerized
And when I close my eyes
My mind gets paralyzed
That day you came into my life
Girl you left me hypnotized (hypnotized)
Hypno, hypno
Now every time I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind
In my mind, in my mind
Cause when I saw you the first time
Girl you left me hypnotized (hypnotize)
Hypno, hypno
And even when I close my eyes
You just pop up in my mind

Girl you left me hypnotized, hypnotized
Now every time I close my eyes you just pop up in my mind
In my mind, cause when I saw you the first time
Girl you left me hypnotized, hypnotized
