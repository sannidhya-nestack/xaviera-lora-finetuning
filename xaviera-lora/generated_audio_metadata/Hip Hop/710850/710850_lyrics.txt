If I could fly like a bird in the sky so high
If I could fly like a bird in the sky, so high
Like a bird
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm so high, I'm so high
I could fly like a bird in the sky so high
I could fly like a bird in the sky so high
I could fly
Like a bird in the sky so high
I could fly like a bird in the sky so high
Like a bird, like a bird, like a bird, like a bird
So high
In the sky so high
Like a bird in the sky so high
In the sky so high
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life
So high, life, life, life, life, life, life
So high
