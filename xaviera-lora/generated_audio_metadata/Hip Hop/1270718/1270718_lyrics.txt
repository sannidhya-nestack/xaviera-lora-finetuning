Yo, I see you tryna flex, acting like you run the block

In the same game (in the same game)
Walk across that line
Focus on your grind, let me handle mine (it's a line)
Stay in your lane, but better know your role
You ain't built for this, so don't lose control
You wanna be someone but you just a fake

Better know your role, you ain't built for this
So don't lose, it's a lie
Stay in your lane, fuck, know your own strength
This ain't your game, don't go the wrong lane, it's a lie
You ain't gotta front, just stay true
Focus on your path, let me do what I do, it's a lie
This is the boy, the boy, the boy, the boy, the true, it's a lie
In your lane pump, don't cross that line, focus on your grind, let me handle mine (handle mine)
Stay in your lane pump, better know your role, you ain't built for this, so don't lose control (don't lose control)
But you just a fake, chasing other dreams, man, that's your mistake

You tryna be someone, but you just a fake
Chasing other dreams, man, that's your mistake (that's your mistake)

That's why you tryna hustle
Keep it blunt
