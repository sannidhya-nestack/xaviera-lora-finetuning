Think I'm in love with a vampire
Her mouth drips with sweet words
And she talks all day about the grave
And says she can't get a suntan anyway
What the vampire? Hey, what the vampire? She's sexy and she knows it
Immortal life, hella, yeah, she chose it She says her heart is dark and empty
The only sure cure is to get with me She needs to give up that twilight
Before I leave her in the daylight What the vampire?
Hey, what the vampire? She's sexy and she knows it
Immortal life, hella, yeah, she chose it
I hate vampires
They're so fantastic and they're all so, um, vain
And she doesn't know what she wants except for me
And I'm not interested
I'm tired of thinking about her
Tired of thinking about her
I think I'm in love with a vampire
She only comes out after dark
When we try to share a quiet dinner
She stares at my neck like it's art
She says garlic's a deal breaker
I can't even eat my pizza in peace
She loves plan and midnight steak outs
But the steak is actually me
She's sipping blood from a chalice
While telling me I'm just her type
I'm trying hard not to notice
But the candlelight shows her appetite
I can't believe I got tangled up
In this romance so bizarre
Now she's humming funeral dirges
And insisting we go haunt a bar
I hate vampires
They're so fang-tastic but they're all the same
And they don't know what they want except for me
And I'm not interested anyway
I'm tired of hearing about'em
Tired of hearing about'em
What the vampire?
Hey, what the vampire? She's sexy and she knows it
Immortal life, hella, yeah, she chose it
What the vampire? I'm done with all that nightlife
I'm stepping back to my daylight
No more turning pale in her sight
What the vampire? I'm turning off this gothic scene
Finally free from her guillotine
What the vampire? Goodnight
