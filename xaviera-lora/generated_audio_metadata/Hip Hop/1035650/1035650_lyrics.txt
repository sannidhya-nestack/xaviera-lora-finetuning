Oh yeah
This one goes out to my number one hun
Driving in my car in the middle of the day
Finished all my work now it's time to play
Been a long hot day cause I'm thinking about your love
Your love your love
Now I'm out on the road doing 80
Jamming to the hippie hop just like an 80
Drop top down on the song
Make a little trip to see my number one
My number one hun
Rough cuts simmer on down
Get in the car, I'm driving uptown
At four in the morning or the afternoon
Yo, it's never too late and it's never too soon
Can't wait for the love I'm dreaming of
Next to another, you up above
Love doesn't matter if you're shy
Step on the pedal, let's fly
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, meanwhile every day
I got the will if you got the way
Driving in my car in the middle of the night
Cop pulled me over started reading the right
So I looked my answer wish I could hang
But that'll put me late by more than a minute for my date
Sweet mate a hot little smart fox taking the bait
So the cop gave in cause he knew that look
He had seen it all before and he knew exactly what it took
Rough cuts and my arms down
Get in the car, I'm driving uptown
At four in the morning or the afternoon
Yo, it's never too late and it's never too soon
Can't wait for the love I'm dreaming of
Next to another, you up above
Love doesn't matter if you're shy
Step on the pedal, let's fly
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the rhythm, you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, meanwhile every day
I got the will, you got the way
Driving, driving, driving, driving
Driving, driving, make it, make it, make it last
Driving, driving, driving, driving
Driving, driving, make it, make it, make it last
Going down with the lyrical jam
So deaf you got to say damn
Smooth like a razor through the microphone
Cut and pull like static on your telephone
Listen to the lyrical master
Blasting on the scene and creating a disaster
Boom
Fucked right on cue
Before you know it I've bought and sold you
Can't wait for the love I'm dreaming of
Next to another you up above
Love doesn't matter if you're shy
Step on the pedal let's fly
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the rhythm you got the rhyme
Driving, driving, meanwhile everyday
I got the milk, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the milk, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile every day
I got the milk, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the whip, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile every day
I got the whip, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile all the time
I got the whip, you got the wine
Driving, driving, meanwhile
