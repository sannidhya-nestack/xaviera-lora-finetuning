In the corners of my mind you linger there
A shadowed kiss, a broken prayer
Faded whispers on the midnight air
You were the fire, now it's cold despair
And I'm still dancing with the ghost of you
In the dark where the light won't break through
A love that burned now turned to ash
But the memory stays, it never passed
It's a dark romance haunting my soul
Memories of you, never letting go
In every breath, in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
The silence speaks your name in my sleep
In a dream where the wounds run deep
A heart once whole, now torn and steeped
In the love we couldn't keep
And I'm still dancing with the ghost of you
In the dark where the light won't break through
A love that burned now turned to ash
But the memory stays, it never passed
It's a dark romance haunting my soul
Memories of you never letting go
In every breath, in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
The silence speaks your name in my sleep
In a dream where the wounds run deep
A heart once whole now torn and steeped
In a love we couldn't keep
And I'm still dancing with the ghost of you
In the dark where the light won't break through
A love that burned now turned to ash
But the memory stays it never passed
It's a dark romance haunting my soul
Memories of you never letting go
In every breath, in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
It's a dark romance, haunting my soul
Memories of you, never letting go
In every breath, in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
Every touch, every lie
Like a storm that never dies
We were tangled out of time
Now I'm forever yours in my mind
It's a dark romance haunting my soul
Memories of you never letting go
In every breath in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
I'm still dancing in the dark with you
Though you're gone you're the love I knew
A flame that fades but the scars enhance
My heart's locked in this dark romance
I'm still dancing in the dark with you
Though you're gone, you're the love I knew
A flame that fades but the scars enhance
My heart's locked in this dark romance
It's a dark romance haunting my soul
Memories of you never letting go
In every breath, in every glance
I'm still lost in this dark romance
This dark romance, your dark romance
