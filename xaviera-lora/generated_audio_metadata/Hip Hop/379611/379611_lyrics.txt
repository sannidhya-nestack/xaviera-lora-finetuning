You second guess yourself
Pressure cook your hair
It ain't what you think
It's what you do
It's all about you, it's what you do
It's how you move and how could I lose
Everything true and all that we knew
That time you kept me alive with a punch drunk
Love some budding booze
In bed with cartoons we lay past noon
Rub me loose when I'm black and blue
And now all I got is a track about you
Paranoia strikes deep
You can run but you can't speak
So you throw distance in between
And you wander from scene to scene
And you are dealing
And you make it through
Time passes
And you grow now
She's leaving on a jet plane
Don't et me, don't regret me
Try to remember the good things that wrecked me
If I could change the past would you let me
Fell faster than you know when you met me
Now it's a tragic sad destiny
The rain ain't the same when you're not next to me
My phone don't ring, no text messaging
Now you're so far away by the sea
I can't even breathe, I can't even reach out
Touch you in dreams, I wanna release but I can't stop squeezing
You know my reasons
I change like seasons
But you know down deep we connect JB
But your eyes can't see we were meant to be
And you are dealing
And you'll make it through
Time passes
And you grow now
Shoot, I started rhyming back in'79
Way back when Grandmaster was flashing and Jalisa was fine
And even though my flows is viscous as some $10 glue
I've stuck around, y'all hear this sound and be like, "Hey G-Lou"
Well now it's Ronnie P and CKP
Two fellas from the group known as the A .G.
It's a abstract Uncle Benzo collab without my man Pap
Dude got sucked in the lab
Enough of that, it's time to move on,'bout to sing this song like Donkey Kong, and
You didn't ask but you know I will provide my two cents like Uncle Phil, but
I'm not here to set you straight and make you contemplate about the things you hate, although I
Will say that I told you so when you told me, "Yeah, Joe, this girl is dope," I mean
I thought from the very start that she would break your heart'cause she was kinda rascally
And typically when a bird's in the tree, I play it lowkey, let her walk right past me
But you told me that she was the special lady you were missing
And she told you that you were the only fella she was kissin'
She may have what you want and you may have what she needs but
It's time to move on up like G e Jefferson and Weez
And you are dealin'
And you'll make it through
Time passes
And you grow now
