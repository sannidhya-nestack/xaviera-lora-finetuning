I see a lot of broke-ass niggas around here with that weak shit
We ain't got no money, your partner got money, you broke
It me and Robert, we lit, I just went Barbie to get it

In the streets 94-5, nigga ain't takin' my shit
My uncle been whippin' them pies
Check out this nigga it's real
We got it or not
Talk about that fake being rich
You getting exposed tonight

You ride like a motorbike
You on your ride to rip
You got the baddest chick
Say you be baggin' some
But she really baggin' shit
You in these streets or not
You get that heat or not
You poppin' bottles or not
Yo bitch a model or not

Wish time back, wish time, wish time back, wish time back, hold up
Wish time back, wish time, wish time back
You fuckin' hoes or not, or not
You rockin' shows or not, or not
Your bitch on go or not, or not

Wish time back, wish time, wish time back
Wish time, wish time back, wish time back
Wish time, wish time back, wish time back, wish time back
