Come on over, tonight is game night
Gonna play under the moonlight
Eat pizza and french fries
Oh my, mama made apple pie
With ice cream, vanilla ice cream
I know it's gonna be quite a scene
Yes I scream, yes you scream
We all scream for ice cream
Hey guys, I love this ice cream, do you? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Uh-huh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Come on over, I'm gonna DJ
Gonna dance all night in our PJs
When the time's right, after midnight
We can chill out, have more apple pie
I've got toppings, lots of toppings
And mama's homemade whipped cream
Yes I scream, yes you scream
We all scream for ice cream
We all scream for ice cream
Hey, hey, hey
I've got toppings, lots of toppings
And mama's homemade whipped cream
Yes I scream, yes you scream
We all scream for ice cream
We all scream for ice cream
We all scream for ice cream
We all scream for ice cream
