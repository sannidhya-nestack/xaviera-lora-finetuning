Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
We don't play games, so who's the next batter?
That's gon' make me bust shells and make your eggs splatter
Your name don't matter, you better simmer down
Beef start cookin' when it's hot time for dinner now
You got the dogs around, they all get a plate
But pick the scraps up before they come investigate
I don't just drop bombs, I make'em detonate
So when a couple more moves, I scream and checkmate
I'm tryna get paid plus eat well
So try to come into these waters, you gon' see shells
Try to come across these borders, it's gon' be hell we deal
Tell y'all about the L where the G's dwell
You know the streets well
There no making noise
Have your team full of blood clots like Jamaican boys
Shit get too bad then I'm taking yours
Heavy dried out in the summer before you raising yours
Down South Florida stand up
You from the suburbs to the hood stand up
No matter where you from let them fools know what's up
It's down South Florida everybody stand up
On my down south niggas with where you at
On my bride county niggas with where you at
On my dead county niggas with where you at
On my palm beach niggas with where you at
Down south Florida stand up
You from the suburbs to the hood stand up
No matter where you from let them fools know what's up
It's down south Florida everybody stand up
On my down south niggas with where you at
On my bride county niggas with where you at
On my dead county niggas with where you at
On my palm beach niggas with where you at
Too much reefer smoke, too many Remy bottles
We fill pistols with hollows cause we don't chill with models
We chill, snooty big booty bitches this hot shit
Can't get they ass in they pants but at least they raw
Fig it off and get off me, niggas tryna be like me
But they don't do it how I do it they ain't G like me
I'm straight fire on the MIC, water me down
Big boogie down down, the crowd loving me now
On stage rocking the show, toe up from the flow up it slacks
With a flow up throw backs, with a so up so what
We ain't blow up yet we get down
How stupid does that sound? Too tight to slack, now you got to feel it
Got a misconception'bout us and you got to kill it
In the land of sunny skies, sharks in dirty water
We reside in down south, where a lot of them floutin'
Down south Florida, stand up
You from the suburbs, through the hood, stand up
No matter where you from, let them fools know what's up
It's down south Florida, everybody stand up
All my down south niggas whip where you at
All my bride county niggas whip where you at
All my dead county niggas whip where you at
All my palm beach niggas whip where you at
Down south Florida stand up
You from the suburbs to the hood stand up
No matter where you from let them fools know what's up
It's down south Florida everybody stand up
On my down south, niggas whip where you at
On my pride county, niggas whip where you at
On my day county, niggas whip where you at
On my palm beach, niggas whip where you at
Now you know where I bees at (I ain't hard to find)
Where I blow my trees at (yeah)
Where I get my cheese at (hey)
It's La De Del, nigga, home of the brave
You treadin' in deep water, then watch out for the waves I got
Nothing but time with nothing to lose
My niggas is on the move and you ain't got a clue
It's you know who
We back in the building
Caving in ceilings knocking your grill in
Rip through your speaker this the real feature
Come down south and see how these boys treat you
Raise it up a level foot mashing the pedal
Upgrade the bass and adjust the treble
Any nigga that's up in here looking for trouble
Gon find it and get found off in a bloody puddle
Ball up your knuckles swing your fist to the shit
Let me know where you at gon head represent like
You from the suburbs to the hood, stand up
No matter where you from, let them fools know what's up
It's down south Florida, everybody stand up
I'm a lot of dead niggas
Where you at?
Melrose Parkway
Where you at?
Deep side, shallow side
Where you at?
Franklin, Sunland
Where you at?
Yeah, South Florida, all around the world
All the hoods we ain't shot out, we still got love
Stash House, remember the name
