Everybody with the bottles in the club, blow your hands and your drinks up high (I know you a wild boy for this)
Everybody with the bottles in the club, blow your hands and your drinks up high (yeah)
I'm drinkin', throwin' back shots, she leakin', takin' back shots
Mommy lovin' when I do what it does,'cause we all VIP, poppin' bottles in the club
Pass the Ciroc, sip the Hennessy
Girl why you actin like Patron your enemy
Bottles on ice, the loudest on deck
The only problem that we gon have is what's next
Tattoos on her neck
Break her body down, superman with the sex
Superman lover, spy hard undercover
She call me Batman, Dark Knight with her rompers
Gotta breathin like asthma
Grab your chest, drive her drunk it's a hazard
Some swervin on the highway but who gives a fuck
This ain't God, that is Friday
Everybody with the bottles in the club
Throw your hands and your drinks up high
Everybody with the bottles in the club, throw your hands and your drinks up high
Everybody with the bottles in the club, throw your hands and your drinks up high
Everybody with the bottles in the club, throw your hands and your drinks up high
Separate the weak from the actors, it's hard to creep these Harlem streets
Sip a champagne with a Grand Marnier, don't get it confused like Spurs or Kanye
I fly straight these niggas a strong J
New York City back to Bombay
Niggas saying Benny yo you feeling yourself?
Haters talking suicide they should kill they self
But I don't mind I'm on my grind
I gotta get this money roll next for time
Shorty talking shit like she pressed for time
But a couple big faces get extra time
Ass and Martin
Mercy and Largo
Prano's capo
Accounts and combo
Cigars from Castro
That's how my week goes
I'm taking this whole shit over
D bro
