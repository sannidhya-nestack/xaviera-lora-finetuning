Welcome to my city (ayy, ayy)
Where the girls are pretty (ayy, ayy)
It's time for some shirt and skin (ayy, ayy)
Those girls here better than any (ayy, ayy)
And we rollin' through, who knows?
Might let you hang out with the crew
Hit the mall or the zoo
My hotel room hit the pool
Bring them all shot guns to set (ayy, ayy)
Welcome to my city (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Man it's the bill we got civilians in the hills
On the streets in the trap on the beach
Dealerships worth a few million each
Running folks that'll take pictures when they say cheese
Music city represents talking wet bout us then you brush a pant
Cause God don't like ugly and I don't either
Only place we don't need to
You pay the meter if you're a lyrical leader
They all know the whip, they all know the chick
Stop us on the boardwalk, true take a pic
Think nothing of it, peeps who done bought my songs
Never did me wrong, Davidson County is where I belong
Trackin' for a new slam to course
We got everything you're lookin' for
Titans spreadin' sounds if you talkin' sports
Hit I-24, see what else in store
Have a bonfire, make a couple s'mores
Go to the farm, take care of a couple chores
Work during the day, party at night
So we never snore, hustle hard to stay employed
Bright lights, club bites, sit back and enjoy
Several areas that you might wanna avoid
Extracurricular's for you to join
Got some bums, gotta some
We got the Batmanville in the interstate capital
May not have parties like Plexiglas
But we got musicians playing saxophone
Shout out to the 615
We be bout that life so don't even try
Welcome to my city (ayy, ayy)
Where the girls all pray (ayy, ayy)
Skrrt, booster, shine and skrrt (ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayyy (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayay (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayya (ayy, ayy, ayy, ah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (ayy) (ayy, ayy) (ayy, ayy) (ayy, ayy) (ayy, ayy, ayy) (ayy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayy) (ayyy, ayyy) (ayyy, ayyy) (ayyy, ayyy)
Country music, hall of fame, folks come here to make a name
Must perfect a banjo if you got dreams of a Lambo
Showing artists who get started off their return home after parting with their savings
Yeah it's crazy losing every penny you have amazing
To make matters worse Amazon overcharge your credit card
As if you ain't already had a reason you should set it off
Financial hardships come with the territory of experience
We out here having fun what's so serious
Now the richest cities in the states make a dollar less'til next payday
Anyways when it comes to being late
Flight might be delayed'cause we always late
To a meeting, grief or corporate meeting
Always apologize because the ones waiting usually idolize you or your position
As you get paid by the show or commission
CEOs try another path to nutrition
They ain't passing admissions
Read as good as long as it's done as it should
Though it hasn't followed still love my hood
Population filled with varying occupations
Different complications
Number one metropolitan area in the USA
Once you settle down with us I promise that you'll wanna stay
Welcome to my city
Where the girls are pretty (ayy, ayy)
Scramble since your hair's skinny (ayy, ayy)
Who's wearing hair better than me (ayy, ayy)
When we rolling through, who knows?
Might let you hang out with the crew
Hit the mall or the zoo
My hotel room hit the pool
Bring the moonshine girls to see (ayy, ayy)
Welcome to my city (ayy, ayy)
