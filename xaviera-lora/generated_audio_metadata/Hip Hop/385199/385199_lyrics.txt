Yeah, yeah, kinship
B-S-U-P
You know what? (Check it out, my conception is immaculate)
The genesis begins like light in the universe
Antibiological, a style that will soon reverse
The way you used to hear in hip-hop on wax (wax)
Even though it's mad funky, it's not about the tracks (tracks)
It's all about the wicked check one twos
And the higher intellectual level that we cruise
So you ain't no father to the style that pleases
hip-hop gave kinship like Mary gave Jesus
The concept, immaculately concepted
Down with the forces of nature, so accepted
You must respect it because it has been proven
That the jazzy kinship sounds will keep your heads moving
So who's in the house for nine nickel plus uno?
The kids with the jazzy mellow sounds, kids you know
The K to the I to the N ship as we trip
the conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
Check it out cause my conception is immaculate
How does it end and where does it begin
From the shades of the jazz so my king can transcend
Music soothes the soul, yes say I
It all came from the e at Old Duva
Carried like a feather on the winds of time
Transforming from jazz to blues and all the rhyme
Like slang it'll change, right cat daddy
Thank G .O .D for my big brother U .P
Now how does it feel when lost on a quest
Were you ever on the path that was laid by the best
My guess
The small step you took made your regrets
You took it as a game that you play out at recess
So jot down the notes on the sound
The mental state is calm, the music is profound
You see the beauty of conception
So you wanna tackle it
It ain't born, the conception was immaculate
Check it out, my conception is immaculate (immaculate conception)
Check it out, my conception is immaculate
Check it out, my conception is immaculate
So check it out, so check it out (check it out, my conception is immaculate)
Check it out, my conception is immaculate
Check it out, my conception is immaculate (it's like that)
Check it out, my conception is immaculate (so check it out)
Check it out, my conception is immaculate
It goes dang diggy dangy dangy dang diggy diggy dangy dangy dang diggy diggy dang diggy dangy dang diggy diggy dang diggy dangy dang diggy diggy
Skippy don't be bop, damn it's the jam
Ripping mics never slip, rapping tight like saran
So can't you visit plan, yes we are
Concepts out of grandma's old pickle jar
Herb again to the core, cause that's what mama pour
Me and my brother UP, tell him some more
See this is how me and my brother connect
We have the extra live vibe sessions coming correct
So check the way we be like rocking the spot
Over hypnotic sounds that be shaking your block
So jock as if you must but don't jock
To the point that I might have to give my boxers an adjustment
I just meant that you should give up the emulation
Find your own style son kill the stagnation
My patience all wearing kinda thin
So I got to recoup and like represent my kid
The E-S, the Poocah, Miss N-U-P
Individual rude boys are we
Even if I hit it from the front or from the back
I get farther from my father cuz my concept is immaculate
Check it out cuz my conception is immaculate (Immaculate conception)
Check it out cuz my conception is immaculate
It's like that
Check it out cuz my conception is immaculate
So check that out
Check it out cuz my conception is immaculate
Check it out
Immaculate conception
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out this my conception is immaculate
Check it out'cause my conception is immaculate
