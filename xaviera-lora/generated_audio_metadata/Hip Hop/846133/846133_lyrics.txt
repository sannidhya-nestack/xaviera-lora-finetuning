Yeah, I gotta help myself a little bit
Yeah, yeah, good shit
Which way am I going man up or down I can't move I'm stuck soon as I touch the ground
Which way do I turn man right or left
Which one am I really fighting for life or death it's been
So many hustles so many struggles
So many hate you still so many love you
So many so many's I don't know what I'm talking bout
So many stepping in and so many been walking out
Where do I go when there's a fork in the road
What can I do with the four closed on
Plus the banks ain't forking over loans
I gotta fend for my family and divorce though
Flows read like this week's horoscope
This country's fucked up'cause we import the dope
Find a way to liberate is what's important though
So don't believe what you heard from the horse's throat
We gotta get where we going to
This is just my point of view
So if it's annoying you
Then you probably going through the same shit
That we going through
Going through obstacles
Could've swore I had a pocket full of cash
That must've been an optical illusion
Can't sense where to go
All of a sudden vertigo
I feel like jumping hurdles but I got'em vertical
I'm at the end of my rope and the curtains closed
What the fuck am I working towards
And how come I keep on hurting so much
What the fuck am I searching for
Got a perfect score still I don't see what's my purpose
If you regurgitate my verse I'll put you under the surface
You know I'll be coming if the cash ain't perfect
But quit rap, cause it just ain't worth it, so I just stay working
Which way am I going man, up or down, I can't move, I'm stuck soon as I touch the ground
Which way do I turn man, right or left, which one am I really fighting for, life or death
It's been so many hustles, so many struggles, so many hate you still, so many love you
So many so many's I don't know what I'm talking'bout, so many stepping in this
So many been walking ass
It's like I'm living backwards
My life's been in shackles
Like I've been driving in circles
Without no working axles
Which way am I going man
I ain't really knowin'
Like I've been shooting roids
But I ain't really growing
I'm stuck in the same place
Hustling to change pace
Bustin' my ass to get away
And ain't nobody gave chase
I'm running from everything
And gunning for everyone
Know when I see a early grave
But hoping the day will never come
See too many people
Too many P .E .P .Us
Too many living a movie life with way too many sequels
Too many fam now and I ain't got a damn thing
Too many hands out asking for some damn change
A lot of hate now and only a little love back
But it's been like that ever since I was a little rugrat
Mama raised me crazy, daddy made me shady
Down in the basement finding little baggies in the eighties
And I never thought I'd be feeling the way I'm feeling right now
Wanna be heard with every word I write down
So I fast forwarded past them cats hoing out
Live it then spit it like I'm the last poet
And I swear if I keep trucking I'll be ending up with something
Thinking that I'm coming up and still coming up with nothing
So I'm fading in and fading out
Made it in and made it out
So even when I'm talking out loud I still don't know what I'm talking about
Where am I going man up or down
I can't move I'm stuck soon as I touch the ground
Which way do I turn man right or left
Which one am I really fighting for?
Life or death it's been
So many hustles
So many struggles
So many hate you still
So many love you
So many so many's I don't know what I'm talking'bout
So many stepping in and so many been walking out
Which way am I going man?
Up or down I can't move
I'm stuck soon as I touch the ground
Which way do I turn man?
Right or left?
Which one am I really fighting for?
Life or death it's been
So many hustles
So many struggles
So many hate you still, so many love you
So many so many's I don't know what I'm talking'bout
So many stepping in and so many been walking out
