Looking for a lover
I'm gone love you boy
Looking for a lover
Feel me
Baby
I'm gone love you boy
Come on drop that beat
Make us feel dizzy and we'll get off our seats
That's when the right bass and the Pedra meet
We're not thinking of sleep
Too old
Get it on get it on now
Come on drop
Get it on get it on now
Get it on get it on get it on now
I don't
Too old
Come on drop that beat
Make us feel dizzy and we'll get off our seats
That's when the right bass and a fat drum meet
We're not thinking of sleep
Too old
Get it on get it on now
Come on drop
Get it on get it on now
Get it on get it on get it on now
I don't
Too old
Looking for a lover
I'm gon love you boy
Lookin' for a lover
Feel me, baby
I'm gonna love you boy
Lookin' for a lover
Lookin' for a lover
Come on drop that beat
Make us feel dizzy and we'll get off our seats
That's when the right bass and a fat drum meet
We're not thinking of sleep
Too old
Get it on get it on now
Come on drop
Get it on get it on now
Get it on get it on get it on now
I know
Too old
Looking for a lover
I'm gone love you boy
Lookin' for a lover
Feel me, baby
I'm gonna love you boy
