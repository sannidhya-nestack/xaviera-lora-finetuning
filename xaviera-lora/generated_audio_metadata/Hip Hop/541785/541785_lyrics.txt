(Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom)
Word of mouth (Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom)
Yeah (Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom), sometimes you gotta put it on pause (Bottom, bottom, bottom)
Is there any girl out there with a little mercy? A little controversy to hurt me? That really deserve me?
Yo I'm in the studio why you keep calling me?
When you can't stand the thought of me sitting in the lab
And you gotta keep me mortally wounded from the heat that we bring to each other
Like Lebron to the ramp on the first day of summer
Enchiladas is burning, come on
The word of mouth you heard about the new newcomer
You stepped in my socks, I done stepped on the line
Rocks got the block saying skip to my line
I'm not like you
Girl I'm an artist you a nag gotta go do you
You try to set me back with that oh boo hoo
Girl you know know know know know know I know you
Eloquently speaking
Challenging words had me saying yo this I'm keeping
Now I'm leaving it was love at first sight
Slugs at first fight got me falling off the deep end
Little birdie looking pretty
Hurry hurry hurry come and come and hurt me
This is for for for for for for for for ah ah ah ah ah
Angry birds
Follow me, swallow me, open heart door
Policy I will see if you really really wanna hurt me
This is for for for for for for for for for for for angry birds
Put'em out
I'm the man behind the mic
Make it seem like it's something I really like, uh
And when you give me a silly fight
Now there's a lot a lot a lot a lot of things to write
About relationships
With you it's like I can't even take a
Cause you know I'ma take a slip
Better yet a puff I'ma take a lift
Out of the country into the sky
Past the clouds in the universe as we fly
Like time flies girl tell me why
There used to be love not as hate in your eyes
Word of mouth and I'm totally committed
To keep these words wrapped around your head like I fed it
A lot of ways to have fun with it
A lot of ways to run with it
I'm not amazed at your silly games
And by the way I'm done with it
Little birdy
Lookin' birdie, hurry, hurry, hurry
Come and come and hurt me
This is for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
No pain, rebirth
Follow me, swallow me, open heart door
Policy I will see if you really, really wanna hurt me
This is for, for, for, for, for-for-for-for-for-for-for ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah
I thought you heard it, what's the verdict? It's me that you heard and it's me you prefer
But it's me that you drive, coo-coo, like a bird
So, so fly away, you can't afford a ticket I will buy the way
And by the way, yo, something's up now
Thank God for an undo button (button, button, button, button, button, button)
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop bop, bop, bop, b-b-b-b-b-b-bop
Little birdie, lookin' purty, hurry, hurry, hurry, come and come and hurt me (this is for, for, for, for, for, for, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Angry birds (what?) follow me, swallow me, open heart though, policy I will see if you really, really wanna hurt me (this is for, for, for ,for, for, for, ah, ah, ah)
Angry birds, little birdie, looking pretty
Hurry, hurry, hurry, come and come and hurt me
This is, this is, this is, this is
F-F-F-F-F-F-F for a-a-a-a-a-a-a angry birds
Follow me, swallow me, open heart though
Policy I will see if you really, really wanna hurt me
Angry birds (what)
Little birdie, looking pretty
Hurry, hurry, hurry
