Me on the top and I won't stop, me on the top and I won't stop, me on the top and I won't stop, me on, me on, me on the top (come on)
Got my hands waving high to the sky
Letting you know that I'm the man'til the day that I die
My mojo stupid, now tell me why would I lie
You see champion characteristics, hey look at my eyes
Can't stop, won't stop, I'ma win
Push it to the limit, no I really can't give in
Oh no I can't pretend, push it to the end
Hey do I have to say this all over again?
baby it's
It ain't a problem, it's my job son
Sweep the streets clean, rinse it up, keep it lean
There's players in the frame, up in the game
Thinking things have changed but it's still the same, uh
Still about gats and rocks, hoes, pimps, beefs, and smoking glocks
There's always time to fall on your face, what? Always someone to erase, yeah
So watch your step cause do what you're told
Or you'll wind up in a box all cold
This is my kingdom always was
Bad ass thinks as bad ass does
So watch your step cause do what you're told
Or you'll wind up in a box all cold
This is my kingdom always was
Bad ass thinks as bad ass does
Got my hands waving high to the sky
Letting you know that I'm the man'til the day that I die
My mojo's stupid, now tell me why would I lie?
You see champion characteristics, hey look at my eyes
Can't stop, won't stop, I'm a winner
Push it to the limit, no I really can't give in
Oh no I can't pretend, push it to the limit
Hey do I have to say this all over again?'Cause baby yeah
Me on the top and I won't stop me
Me on the top and I won't stop me
Me on the top and I won't stop
Me on the, me on the, me on the top
You might think that you can hunt me down
Steal my juice, uh, wear my crown
But in the end you'll find the fung
Smoked out face down in my trunk
If you all move to my plan
Things'll work out fine, turn out grand
If everything works to my design
We'll all be down and it's still all mine
So watch your step cause do what you're told
Or you'll wind up in a box all cold
This is my kingdom, always was
Badass things is badass
So watch your step'cause do what you're told
Or you'll wind up in a box all cold
This is my kingdom, always was
Badass things as badass does
Got my hands waving high to the sky
Letting you know that I'm the man'til the day that I die

Now tell me why would I lie (lie)
