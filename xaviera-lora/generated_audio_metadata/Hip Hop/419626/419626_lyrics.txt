It's 8 o'clock and I just got home from work
And I smell the smell of incense
You know where to be found
But I already know what the business is
So quickly, I jump into the shower
Dry off that I'm in my boxers
Anticipating the moment when I see you
And I know you'll make it through, what a game
Then just as I thought, baby girl there you are
The way the red looks on your skin
To be such a dime must really be a sin
The way the lingerie accentuates your curves
Baby, you the finest thing in the whole world and all (T-T-T-T-T-T-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te)
Hate your love and that teddy, you make me so ready (You make me, you make me, you make me, you make me)
Hate your love and that teddy, you make me so ready (T-T-T-T-Tet-T-T-Te-Te-Te)
Girl, your body feels a thing out, right?
You even got the color I like
Whenever you're wearing your teddy
It makes me wanna get closer, closer, closer
Teddy, teddy, teddy, teddy, teddy
Teddy, teddy, teddy, teddy, teddy
So what now?
Ain't nobody in this bedroom but me and you, so tell me what we gonna do? (we gonna do)
You got that ice around that Chardonnay, how about a nightcap? Let me fix us both a drink (oh yeah)
Here's your glass, can you take a slow walk to the bed so I can look at that ass? (god damn)
You know that's my weakness
Girl you make it do it
Don't let the red looks on your skin
To be such a diamond must really be a sin
Don't wear the lingerie since you it's your curse
Baby you the finest thing in the world and more
Hey girl in that tittie you make me so ready
Hey girl, I'm addicted, you make me so ready (I wanna get close to you)
Girl, your body feels that thing I like (yeah)
You even got the color I like
Whenever you're wearing your teddy
It makes me wanna get closer, closer, closer
I can't take it no more
When I think about what's behind your secret door
You make my nature rise
When I think about the prize
That you hide between your thighs
And your work that
I can't take it no more
When I think about what's behind your secret door
You make my nature rise
But not think about the prize
That you have between your thighs and your work desk
Teddy Teddy
Hey girl in that teddy
You make me so ready (You make me, you make me, you make me)
Teddy Teddy
Hey girl in that teddy
You make me so ready (I wanna get)
Girl, your body feels that thing out right
You even got the color I like
Whenever you're wearing your teddy
It makes me wanna get closer, closer, closer
