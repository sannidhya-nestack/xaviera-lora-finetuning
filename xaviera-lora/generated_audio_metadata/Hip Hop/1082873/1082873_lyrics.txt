I been searching for that cadence (right)
Rearrangement on my patience (right)
In a lane with dedication so blatant
I'm feeling like I am a patient
I am a spaceship, I can't escape this
And my expansion to rocket the flames bitch
Hand to the handle, a pocket, I can't even stop it
My words to the verse is a facelift
I just wanna stay alive living like I'm giving everything I'm doing rooted
I just wanna be a super me to destiny and doing all I can pursuing
Half an eye a lion elephant I am I'm a sentimental monument
Chakra to an eleon I'm on a zillion and in my element
It's my spirit animal by the way
I'm an elemental with a pen
My mental's to the marijuana
Got the token with the word smoke
Cause I glow so Nirvana
As I spin this certain cynic in it
Like I'm kinda cinematic when I win it
Tangible I'm handing you a full amount of sounding out
So influent
So congruent to the fluent of the music
Imma use it to the juices I amuse with
And if you ain't on my level then you better step it up
Or move to the left if the shoe fits
I've been working, working, you can't take my shine away from me
I'ma fly around the world, got the soul to set you free
I've been grinding, finding, you've been sitting back and judging me
Take a breath of all my essence, I'm the juice to all your blessings
Oye, negrita, huh, yo, ho, my Buddha, troopers maneuver
Aim at polluters, saloon out with shooters
I take fit all them brujas in the Uber
You can't wear rumors, these bullets is tutors
Holla, mami with the aura on a milli, no tags
Secure me'cause I really in a bag
I'm a reflex, make'em really wanna gag
Little bad, rabid-ity with the titties all day
Sick of depression, we pressin' the presses
The passion, the pleasure, remember forever
I gotta thank for the past
And since it's all on your ass
Livin' a lie never lasts
Yeah, I'm into it, bein' fluent
I handle it with some sense to it
Been brewin' blood of the innocent
I'm your predicament hood abolitionist
Energy infinite, rah, rah, rah, rah
I know that I got this, I am on a mission
If you standing in my way, you ain't in my vision
I know that I got this, I am on mission
If you standing in my way, you ain't in my vision
I've been working, working, you can't take my shine away from me
I'ma fly around the world, got the soul to set you free
I've been grinding, finding, you've been sitting back and judging me
Take a breath of all my essence
I'm the juice to all your blessings
Inspiration, elemental level
Third eye wide, I'm a demigod queen
Elevation everything, I make it into green
I'm so naked in the scene that the money can't clean
Got the hunger for the love and the loving for the game
And the passion builds flames for the crashing of the pain
If you asking for the fame then you better be the change
Of the rhetoric of everything you ever have claimed
Can't step to this if you not hot
Can't help it if you can't see
'Cause you can't take my flyness or my shine away from me
Can't step to this if you not hot
Can't help it if you can't see
you can't take my flyness or shine away from me
I'm bonding my timing to grind on these beats
How I choose to shine from my grind in the streets
Unwinding my timing to grind on these beats
How I choose to shine from my grind in the streets
I know that I got this
I am on a mission
If you standing in my way
You ain't in my vision
I know that I got this
I am on a mission
If you standing in my way
You ain't in my vision
