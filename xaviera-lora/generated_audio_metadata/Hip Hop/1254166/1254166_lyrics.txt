I live in nightmare
A poison loop in a hidden room
A little sleep soup
A little spell of desire
A taste that ignites
A taste, just a little bite, round shaped soup, you're reeling in the night
A taste, just a little snack, better swallow fast, it'll stab you in the back
A taste, just a little bite, round shaped soup, you're reeling in the night
A taste, just a little snack, better swallow fast, it'll stab you in the back
Oh oh oh, I'm the midnight moon
Uthering secrets in a cauldron deep
Whispering promises to souls that weep
A venomous elixir, oh, get it, boo
Dancing with danger, I'll run made food with you
A taste, just a little bite, razzle in soup, you'll really need a night
A taste, just a little snack, better swallow fast, it'll stab you in the back
Seductress in black with eyes that flicker
Taste in the poison she's a knife sharp sticker, her lips stained
Red with the venom of sin
Awakening pleasures that dwell within
In the depths of the forest where shadows hide
She serves up soup for those who abide
A feast for the wild, the edgy, the free
A symphony of darkness of a song for me
Of a song for me
And a song for you
The hiss of the serpent, the flick of the tongue
Dawns with the devil, you might get stung
Into the night where fantasies bloom
Under the haunted sky in the viper's doom
Rattlesnake soup, a temptress call
A taste of the forbidden, sensual stall
In the garden of shadows where mysteries entwine
She serves up the potion
The hiss of the serpent, the flick of the tongue
Tongs with the devil, you might get stung
Into the night where fantasies bloom
Under the haunted sky in the vipers doom
Rattlesnake suit, a temptress call
A taste of the forbidden, sensual sprawl
In the garden of shadows when the trees entwine
She serves up a potion, dark and divine
Off a song for me
And a song for you
It's a song for me
And a song for you
Rattlesnake soup
Rattlesnake soup
A taste, just a little bite
Rattlesnake soup
You're reeling in the night
A taste, just a little snack
Better swallow fast
It'll stab you in the back
