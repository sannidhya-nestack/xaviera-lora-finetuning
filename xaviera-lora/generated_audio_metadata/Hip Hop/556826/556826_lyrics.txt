Now that's just sick, that's not human, that's fantastic, moving like magic, that's just sick
The throw, the shot, the move, the catch, the kick, they make'em say, that's just sick
you playing up with the best (best) and you know that we put'em up to the test (that's just sick)
Just watch how they playin'
Defy logic and you'll be sayin'
Now that's just sick
We all wanna go pro
Comin' out the huddle screamin'
Let's go
To be amongst the elite
Wanna compete, perform acts of great feat
High dive in the end zone
In full motion down court slamming it home (bringing it home)
Swishin' one for the buzzer beater (yeah)
In the game with the high heater
Now that's just sick
The comebacks are miraculous (yeah)
And when you think they're down they get ridiculous (uh)
Ridiculous
The blood sweat and the tears (yeah)
The speed and the power in the stadium cheers (uh huh)
Haha, they're all webgyms, replay classics, do it again (do it again, uh)
It's all about the great play when we hear all the people they say
"Yo, that's just sick"
That's non-human, that's fantastic, moving like magic, that's just sick
The throw, the kick, the shot, the move, the catch, they make'em say
That's just sick
you playing up with the best (best)
And you know that we put'em up to the test (that's just sick)
Just watch how they play and define logic and you'll be saying
"Now that's just sick"
Man I love watching these guys
Every minute you can see the look in their eyes
They got their mind on the prize
Look to soar, elevate, time to fly
Oh my, now here they go again
Amazing everybody all the way until the end
Here comes another great play and the people in the booth they say, now that's just sick
The comebacks are miraculous, and when you think they're down they get ridiculous
The blood sweat and the tears, the speed and the power in the stadium cheers
Haha, they're all webgyms, replay classics, do it again (do it again, uh)
It's all about the great play when we hear all the people they say
Now that's just sick
That's not human, that's fantastic, moving like magic, that's just sick
The throw, the shot, the move, the catch, the kick
They make'em say, that's just sick
