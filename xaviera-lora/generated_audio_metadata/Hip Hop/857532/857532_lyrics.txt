(I can't let this get to me)
I ain't funding who they should be wrapping up in dollars
Give me some goose or crayon and my nurses will swallow
I've been worth millions if it's Lord willing
I built that dark side, camouflage like a chameleon
It's the top dollar, best money can buy
The couch with holes in'em like croissant bread on the ride
My dog rolls by the low, make the rain from the sky
Too parted to do a diet, take the chunk of the pie
all I ever wanted to do was get money
So I'ma beat this bitch like a knife, Ricky Ricardo
Just a pen to pen, I switch fast, potency level
Catch a can, let it y'all, left 4 grams, I'm back
Superstar, American flag, met rights to brag
Plus double the swag, it's the million dollar baby champion
Pretty punk second to none in Sparks, we never won
I make it rain, a million dollars baby
I make it rain, a million dollars baby
I make it rain, a million dollars baby
We so fly, we shine
I got them out of bed as I'm on the train
That's what I'mma do when I'm on the train
I'll make you play, I'll make your diamonds break
People so fly, we have to play
The independent sorority
Respect that style, so retro
Call us the hip, I throw back
Grab the jersey, next level
I'mma, I'mma be like Fergie
Straight from the can, I'll sit right with some dirty
Claim my throne's that veteran
Transforming all soul with black on
Call me mega, so I'm the bomb
I face them dead on no hiding
Perceive the bottom
Cut the tape, war tee to God
I got you by my lips, I got you by my lips
it's all about the hip with the cash
At the end of the shift
From girl to the dog, I don't let you go
And bring me back some more
it's not okay, baby, if you wanna know
Let's get back to this game
I'll make it right, a million dollars, baby
I'll make it right, a million dollars, baby
I'll make it right, a million dollars, baby
We so free, yeah
Poppin' my band, I'm on the floor
You all together in my streets
I make it rain, I'm in your thoughts baby
So fly, we high, high, high
Okay, it's my go, that mean it's on the floor
And when it comes to money, give me, give me, give me, give me
Throw, throw, throw that cash in the air with them dollars there
Damn, I'm such a brat
Like a kid in a store that is a M-A-M-A-M-A-M-A
Seek of your key in a Chloe bag (Chloe bag)
Do Chanel shades in a sax bag
Now what's next on the list? Lunch, a roof kiss
I'm a badass, classy ass, sassy ass
I don't want no cheap ass fake ass shh
One a million dollar baby keep my full cast raining
If you wanna get with my friend
One seven figure nigga push your eight cursor bigger
Keep it swag on point like they called you Jigga
I'm the diamond princess I can make you say yes
If you wanna get with my friend
I'll make it rain, a million dollars, baby
I'll make it rain, a million dollars, baby
I'll make it rain, a million dollars, baby
We so fly, we high, high, high
Hoppin' out a Benz on the McQueen's
You wanna do it with my friends?
I'll make it rain, a million dollars, maybe
We so fly, we high, high, high
