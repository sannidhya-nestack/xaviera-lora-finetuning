Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
Dear Slim, this is Matt, I'm just a regular fan
I haven't heard from you in weeks, so I just thought I'd check in
And I'm hoping you would have the urge to pick up your pen
And then write me back so we could share some thoughts and maybe be friends
You know a lot of things have happened, lost my aunt and my mother
I lost my job, my apartment, not to mention my brother
You was everything to me but what we both had in common
All the letters that we wrote to you, you never responded
And by the time you finally did, well we both know the rest
Didn't see you at the funeral to pay your respects
You set the box with a starter cap, you signed it by hand
I don't know if you remember me, my brother was still
See the world can call you shady but I know you are slim
And you're the reason why my brother's life has come to an end
Everyday it's hard to reach him so I write you instead
Every letter has a name so which ones have you read?
Dear Slim, this is Madden, I'm writing again
Guess it's better to be enemies, we can't be friends
And all of this could be avoided if you pick up your pen
And write me back so we can talk about the things that you did
See a lot of things have changed, I don't know if you've noticed
Both my mental and my cognitive are equally focused
I can see the whole picture from beginning to end
See the monster wasn't really you, the monster was him
He had a roof, a million posters, tattoo on his chest
And every time you never wrote him back, the man got upset
And the day before my brother died, you know what he did
Told his girl that he would kill her if the baby ain't his
See the world can call you shady, but I know you are slim
And you're the reason why my brother's life has come to an end
Every day it's hard to reach him, so I write you instead
Every letter has your name, so which ones have you read?
Dear Slim, it's the last time I'm writing your ass
I can see the reason why my brother Stan was banned
Thought I had it figured out when I was taking his meds
Every night his thoughts would reach me and I'd write what he said
You don't realize your love replies are killing your people
Your words can open wounds but your silence is lethal
I can see the whole picture both the lie and the truth
See the monster wasn't really standing my way
See it's you with all the issues, you're the one who's obsessed
You're paying back the world for those who never gave you respect
And the day my brother died, the one mistake did he make?
He recorded over everything I said on that tape
See the world can call you shady, but I know you were slim
You're the reason why my brother's life has come to an end
Every day it's hard to reach him, so I write you instead
Every letter has his name, so which ones have you read?
