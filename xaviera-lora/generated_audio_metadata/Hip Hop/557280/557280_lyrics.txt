I've been around, but I'm back
Just kinda feels better when you laugh at me
So girl, I need you to save me from the enemy, that's me
Save me from this hell (Save me from this hell)
I need you here with me
Girl I need your help (Girl I need your help)
Another day (Another day)
Without you here
Girl, why don't you answer the phone? Don't you know it's never good for a man to be alone?
I need you real close to me, close to the place where you supposed to be
I know I got a whole lot of wealth, but I don't wanna spend it all on myself
Yo, let's take a ride in my two seater, until you beg me to call you Ms. Peters
No, I'm not the same Mr. Runaround
I'm Mr. Settle Down, girl yeah come around
And see me turn the brick into a hundred thousand
Alone I hold a block down with you a run of town
We could be the Bonnie and Clyde of this summer now
It is what it is, don't need to dumb it down
Beat up, first to show you that I need ya
Buy you a crib and a whip when I beat up
Save me from myself
Save me from this hell
Girl I need your help
Another day
When I should be
Girl, let me represent you, get you in a presidential suite
Cop you some gems, get you in a Benz eventually
And all your friends, they'll be feeling sentimentally
Deep in they hearts, cause they know just what you meant to me
Without us in each others life, it wouldn't be complete
In other words, it would all just mean defeat
It's complicated, yes simple
Baby, baby, you're the only girl I'm into
Pack your bags, throw'em over your shoulders
Runaway status, change of address notice
No slipping, put your best foot forward
Let's go escrow got the best for us
Left slow rest slow that's what next for us
Better yet that a test for us
It's better laying back in my yard than a hallway
I'm just tired of ducking bullets over broadway
Save me from myself
Save me from this pain (Save me from this pain)
Girl I need your hand (Girl I need your hand)
Another day (Another day)
We're left to here with me (We're left to here with me)
Into the land of luxury
You think you're tall, she's mad and girl standing'em
Exotic patterns keeping them haters off balance
Your talents from above shine above all people
God created many girls next to you none equal
Swag's a statement girl of many words
Chicks get mad at the game angry birds
Haven't they heard you're the only miss peed on this earth
Is it rap if it hasn't occurred
Break you off a mill girl you're made for life
And put something on your neck just to break the ice
Let me gently nudge you away from strife
And let me thank you first hand girl you saved my life yes
Save me from myself
Save me from this hell
Girl I need your help
Another day
Without you here
Save me from my sins
Save me from this hell
Girl I need your help
Another day
Without you here with me
