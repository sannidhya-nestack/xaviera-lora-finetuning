It's into you, into me, acting like you a big star on TV
If you wanna play the game and you wanna do it right
Fuck the haters, do a social light
Snap me this, jab me that, living it up like we're in the grave
In the city of angels, we in the limelight
Fuck the haters, do a social light
Yo, I'm coming back from a concert show
Couldn't see shit over these niggas cellphones
Recording the moment instead of living it up
Homies flashing lights in the eyes of the stage fright
Thinking the whole world cares what you gotta say
Spitting rants and rhymes like you right for the times
Look around you fool, at the others doing it too
You ain't the only one frontin', you ain't the only one side
Answer you, answer me
Acting like you are big style on TV
If you wanna play the game and you wanna do it right
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
Snap me this, chat me that
Living it up like we're aristocrats
You in the city of angels, me in the limelight
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
Tweet that, you twitter for twat
Got 140 characters to give me a blood clot
Head down but you ain't got no shame
The net's more important on the net you've got fame
Fame like Kimmy for being a slut
You saying things will get better and I'm just in the rut
Selfies in the morning and selfies at the bar
Self is what you live with, self is all you are
Insta you, insta me, acting like you are big style on TV
If you wanna play the game and you wanna do it right
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
Snap me this, you chat me that
Living it up like we're aristocrats
You at the city of angels, we in the limelight
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
To you and to me acting like you are big style on TV
If you wanna play the game and you want it to arrive
Fuck the haters you a socialite
Send me this you can't hit that
Living it up like we're aristocrats
You at the city of angels we in the limelight
Fuck the haters you a socialite
Emotify your presence when you don't feel a thing
Tapping's all you're good at when you're tapping your king
I don't follow back and I don't kiss ass
I'm always in front flying high first class
Just think of them pics you can show your kids
Sexting it and texting it like nobody bids
You can count me out if I can count you in
I'll be living in the now not no has been
It's Insta you, Insta me
Acting like you are big style on TV
If you wanna play the game and you wanna do it right
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
Snap me this, chat me that
Living it up like we're aristocrats
You in the city of angels, me in the limelight
Fuck the haters, you a socialite
The you and the me acting like you are big style on TV
If you wanna play the game and you wanna do it right
Fuck the haters you a socialite

You're in the city of angels we in the limelight
Fuck the haters you a socialite
