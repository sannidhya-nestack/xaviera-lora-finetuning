And did you ever have a whip for a girl who could inspire?
Ten thousand years itch with hella hot desire?
Well let me introduce you please
To a girl who fits the bill, I think she took the little red pill
She's a sight to see, this money
Is not worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's scrubs in her high heel shoes
Life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion so fly, you have to get an airplane seat at what cost?
Lost a pretty penny?
Come and get some of your life, a little treat
Turning heads everywhere, trust me, there are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich, one tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh miss money
You're so sweet honey
It's a shame that you adore miss money
Now you got a little would you like a little more miss money
Sweet little honey I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute check your mobile tell me if you got my text
Flexible finesse and I can see that you've been messing with some things I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite a little fatty
Venerous she is very very very catty
Biting up the love is something that you can't ever seem to get enough of
Out of spite, love a car, like to play the part
Crashin' it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, miss money, your fantasy
I think about you every day, I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other, person to a person in your life
Maybe your girlfriend, maybe your wife
Miss money, oh, she's no dummy
Bar's love buddies never ever shot me
With a trickle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
For loves and investment, not selling just to profit
Her laughter rings like a catchphrase of time
But love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of heart, soul, what a portfolio
But if it dividends her love, she'll never
Know how much money you're a fantasy
I wonder if you'll ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
A market of romance she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love it seems too much
Miss money oh the irony's not lost
Can't find her for love, it's an endless car
So she's bankrupt in the market halls
A physical failure, torn apart
But oh, miss money, door still aside
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes, she's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to this money, the bell of the ball, may your assets be liquid
She's funny, oh, the irony's not lost
Camp project for love, it's an endless cost
She's bankrupt in the market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, Miss Money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Buys love, but it's never ever show me
With a sparkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money, the belle of the ball
May your assets be liquid
