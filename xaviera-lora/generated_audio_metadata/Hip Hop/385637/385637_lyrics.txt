Have you blacked out, or maybe it's finally over?
Dressed in a suit, stuck in that pose a lifeless soldier
Nothing but pain was here, couldn't see it, couldn't grab it
Left of you like a silly rabbit, you had to have it
Popped in the middle of a scuffle, sounds were muffled
Everything was moving slow, hot slugs hit your muscles
Pour a ounce of that powder to make it drug related
Twisted up from a homicide, searching as I ooze
Spotlight me down in the book as a crook
He six feet under, mama's picture window
Shout out and his boys in a coma
All these trials and tribulations but it's normal in the game
One day thought it would change but it remains the same
Why do I cut up crack, why would I kill for this brick?
It's the American way, money means power okay
Yeah I know your boy is wrong but what can I do?
Your shorty's eating every night I gotta feed mine too
Yo, your honor check this out, yo, I'm doing my thing
Walking up and down the block seeing who wants some cocaine
Put your hands up, Annie up, this is a stick up
Give me the keys to all the jails and tell my peeps to get up
Yo, your honor check this out, yo, doing my thing
Walking up and down the block seeing who wants some cocaine
Put your hands up, Annie up, this is
On the block, show me a lot, and I know it, hotter than the wind, they took my bends and sold it, yo man I'm gon' ride, for my team'til it hurts, take these shackles off of me so I can breathe and be free, a stone picture
It's what y'all want me to portray, so when it's my turn in court, I won't have nothing to say
Yeah, y'all caught me with the cup and the stone, so get on
Had a 9 mil 380 Calico in my home
Judge, you know how the game is played, you still in the mix
You wanted me to turn state, so this is what I get
Now you wanna put the streets against me like I'm inside
When you know for yourself, I'm gon' ride or die
You ain't got no snitch, you got a Flintstones soldier witch
We'll lock on your neck and shake you like I'm an Eli Pitt
You lock on your neck and shake you like I'm a Eli Pitt
Yo, your honor check this out, yo, I'm doing my thing
Walking up and down the block seeing who wants some cocaine
Put your hands up, ante up, this is a stick up
Give me the keys to all the jails and tell my peeps to get up
Yo, your honor check this out, yo, doing my thing
Walking up and down the block seeing who wants some cocaine
Put your hands up, ante up, this is a stick up
Give me the keys to all the jails and tell my peeps to get up
Caught you staring over my shoulder
Now what's all that for? You got a problem, I can solve it
But I'ma give you some more, in this game you don't play to win
You play to survive, couple ounces will get you killed
Slumped in your ride, yup his soul was shaking
As he slowly dies, can see the stress from death
Cause he was bucking his eyes, no that can't stop
I'm cocky like Rocky for chasing heart patient
Fifteen of life's I'm facing, wondering is it my time
Bleeding on the curve, kill a fool in the hood
As I escape to the burbs, my life is so shaken
In my sleep I scream, I saw me dancing with the devil
Now what does that mean?
Yo your honor check this out, yo I'm doing my thing
Walking up and down the block seeing who wants some cocaine
Put your hands up, man he up this is a party
So I'ma stay on the block (Gimme the keys to all the jails and tell my peeps to get up)
I'ma stay on the block (Yo, yo, Rhonda, check this out)
Yo, I'm doin' my thing (I gotta do somethin')
Walkin' up and down the block, seein' who wants some cocaine (What's up, gang?)
Put your hands up, ante up, this is a stickup (I really don't think so)
Gimme the keys to all the jails and tell my peeps to get up (Well)
I mean, I know y'all gon' sentence me to life
But it really don't matter, you know what I'm sayin'?
My comrades there, my affiliates there
My brother did ten, my other brother did'bout thirteen or fourteen
I mean, I mean, I ain't even worried about it
I go lay down, I do my time
I'm outta here, I'm outta here
Yeah, let me go man, you ain't gotta be grabbin' on me like that
