Down to the end simply for the fact you ain't down with the true
Keep it alive and high till the day I die so tell me what about you
Better believe I'm down for the wave say maybe we can play around
No begging but baby better reckon how many ways to lay it down
With the way my program flow pure let's get lifted
For the fact of the feeling for your body straight got me addicted
Twisted in so many ways, serenade, ain't no masquerades
Face to face, me and you embrace naturally
Thinking of how better ways to serve you
How better ways to please you
How better ways to be true
Shiesty games I see through
So cut the chase, let's get to the point
Better make your mind and rule
To the place where you belong with a rose
Won't never let you go, go, go
Sylvain, Sylvain
Take me away, away
Sylvain
Come on, take me away, away
Straight to the point, better recognize I don't wanna be your man
No doubt to the body, just wanna be your nigga, understand?
7th Heaven's all about me and you
Treating you with the way you wanna be treated
Unless you ask the fool, wanna restart this something like Mike just beat it
For the way it goes, ain't got no time for the game, so instead of restressing
Stressin' on gettin' mucho chedda let alone with the sex
And test for the ones that know, passionate be yours
Where do we spark, macadocious to the most
Where to keep them secrets in the dark
So much poppin' about you needin' to be loved frequently
All day, every day, see no need to keep it secretly
So cut the chase, let's get to the point
Better make your mind and roll
To the place where you belong with a roll
So never to let you go, go
Seven (seven), heaven (heaven)
Take me (take me), can you take me (away)
I'm in heaven, heaven (I got heaven on my mind) take me (take me)
Away, away
Top to the bottom, bottom back to the top, better make it hot
Into the mix with a rock lovin', yeah down to the very last drop
Top of the moment of hot sweaty, steamy, sexy, soft and wet
Caress, expect the best of the best lovin' and nothin' less
Stressin' about the way you're pumpin', bangin' and bumpin'
Straight from the jumpin', showin' off, gotta go in on to the early moan
I'm waitin' something steady goin' and goin' deeper and deeper
Your fire's down to the bone for the facts, same urges and oh so much desire
For the way I feel we'd be friends, down to the end you my nigga
Better believe I'll be there, better reckon I care, I'm your nigga
Know me to get caught up, seen so many dicks I treat and you wrong
Come come at a mix with a one named seven, dive to the place where you belong
Seven, take me away
Save on, save on, save on, save on, save on
Take me away, take me away, take me away, take me away
Save on, save on, save on, save on, save on, save on
Save our way (I show you, I show you how to, you show me how to do this)
Take me away (You like that? Come on, come on)
