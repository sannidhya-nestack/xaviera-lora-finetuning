Calling all my bitches, this ain't a pity party
These boys got your heart trippin', so we blast Lizzo and Cardi
You gave all your power, it's time to take it back
Promise that in this hour, we'll meet you where you're at
I've been where you are, had a broken heart
Had my share of scars, now the healing starts
Gave myself some space, to escape the pain
When men don't know their place, this is what I say
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon' make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon' make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
Hold my purse (yeah, hold my purse)
Hold my purse (hold my purse)
Hold my purse (yeah, hold my purse)
And hold my purse, hold my purse
We got Ben and Jarrett's
And a box of Kleenex
Take turns telling our stories
Singing thank you, next
I've been where you are
Had a broken heart
Had my share of scars, now the healing starts
Gave myself some space, to escape the pain
When men don't know their place, this is what I say
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon' make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
He can't hold me back, no
He can't have me back, no
But you can hold my purse if you want
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon' make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
Hold my purse, hold my purse
This girl don't got pockets but I'm gon' make it work
Hold my purse, hold my purse
I'm too busy rockin' so I put myself first
Hold my purse, yeah, hold my purse (yeah)
Hold my purse (hold my purse)
Hold my purse, yeah, hold my purse (hold my purse)
