Yeah I love the way you work those
Love the way your skirt goes up when you drop it down
Got me wanting to flirt so bad that I can't help but to grab that
If it's half in my face, I shouldn't have to ask
I love the way you toss it up and shake it to the flow
Especially them hips, got'em poppin' back and forth
Now drop it down low, then rock it back slow
Stand up, hands up, know how to stop a show
Drunk in the club, we be seein' this stuff
Girlfriends and their girls try to mingle with us
Nuff said, and we quick to be beatin' it up
I'd put it to your woman if she could keep it on the hush
In the back of the bar
Where we all be at
On some party crap
With Bacardi Taps
Yeah I'm getting lab danced
By some army brat
And she say she got a man
He can hardly rap
Throw your hands up high

Come on girl roll your thighs
Put that n***a in overdrive
I don't wanna socialize
I ain't tryna blow my high
I ain't Jared Joe in line
Tryna get that booty cat
Now I bring it to the side, rolling out the goodie bag
Get you cool and relaxed, fall into your comfort zone
Let me feel your flavor, maybe later you can get the tone
Get you hot all around, rub your body all around
Drop it down, get it low, toss it up, touch your mouth
Got these fellas wild watching how you strut your style
Taking it for show but letting them know you don't
Look around, do it all, all for me and put it out for them to see
When it's time, time to leave, best believe she in my seat
I need it like necessity to see you in that dress this evening
Teasing thoughts of ecstasy, dirty dancing next to me
C-O-M-P-L-E-X, girl do the damn thing
D-R-O-P to the flow then toss it up like champagne
Drop it fast, bounce it back, bring it low, do it slow
Drop it fast, bounce it back, bring it low, do it slow
Drop it fast, bounce it back, bring it low, do it slow
Drop it fast, bounce it back, bring it low, do it slow

Stop trying to keep up with Jug
Which club he at?
He this barbzor?
Does this dude do jumping jacks?
I could never be in love with a stripper
Bar hop, drop a couple dollars and we dipping
Private party through the night to the next evening
Hottie flash titties like Mardi Gras season
Drop it down, pick it up
Dollar bill, lick it up
Down the liquor in his cup
Is this enough? That's what I call a girl going wild
Let her hit the floor, make her Earl on the ground
She hiding from the Kush, coming from the damn border
Soon I'll be in her bush with her camcorder
Call my niggas again, but I ain't really interested
Tell the truth, you only in it for the benefits
She a first come first serve basis
Give you God a few curbs and flirtation
Throw your hands up high, girl, drop it down low
Let me pull you to the side, watch you shake it to the floor
Throw your hands up high girl drop it down low
Let me pull you to the side watch you shake it to the floor
