Uh, it's F .G., baby
Feel good, feel great
It's on your blade
Uh, you know
When the lights go out
Mama, let's break it down for'em
When the lights go out
And the night's gold
And I'm on my own
Now listen here, mama
It wasn't what you wore or didn't wear
It was the way you walk
The way you talk
Your eyes twinkle like midnight in New York
Hair wrap cascading down your profile
Highlighting your smile
It made it worth my while
One summer night
Mmm, yeah
Yeah, the breeze was warm
You walked into this place
And changed my life
I knew you would
The only one
That could take a chance
To be by my side
(I'm tryna be next to you, boy)
When the lights go out
And the night is cold
And I'm on my own
When the darkness comes
I'll hide away
In your arms tonight
As the days go by
I still wonder why
Your silent words can make me cry
(I see your tears falling)
Those crazy games
Too many people play
Is a lesson learned
But I still need to try
(I learned my lesson but I ain't playing no games boy)
when the lights go out
And the night is gold
And I'm on my own
(Doing the night, uh)
When the darkness comes (yeah, darkness)
I'll hide away (uh)
In your arms tonight (I'm in my arms)
Tonight (yeah, sing it, baby)
Oh yeah, the night is gold (it's on your blade)
And I'm on my own
When the darkness comes, I hide away in your arms tonight
When the crying's done
And I felt the pain of losing someone
Don't you feel let down
Just try again, one day you'll find the one
When the lights go out, and the night is cold
And I'm on my own, and the darkness falls
I'll hide away, in your arms tonight
Listen boo, uh, shine sealed the living
Legs quivered, back arched, toes curled, she shiv'n
Eyes half shut, licking lines down the spine
She was mine one time, grabbed her by her hair
Took her from behind, laid her on her stomach flat
Legs closed, hands gripped her back and she like that
And I like this, I reached over we started to kiss
In the wet lips, hot lips, feet in my freaky fit
It was a freaky mix, see I was hard and thick
She wet and tight we clicked just right
Pushed me off spun around
She was down for whatever was clever whenever
My eyes been hushed she laid back again
Legs parted begging me to slide in
I'm riding sliding in and out
Moans escape in her mouth
My love felt snug as a bug in the rug
As we hugged there's no doubt
What it's about is hearing you shout
Say FG feel good feel great
Far greater than you can anticipate
Simple to state you wanted the dime
I gave you weight
Your passion inside your moans your cries
Your eyes
Feeling you clutching me when you thought wrong (I'm on my own, creeping)
Yeah, uh, uh, when the lights go out
Yeah, shadow government, sky high (sky high)
To the new millennium (take me in your arms and I'll be baby)
It's only play time when I talk to you, baby
Can I tell you how much you mean to me?
Can I tell you how much I love you?
Beyond death, beyond reason, beyond love's own power, loving
Your name is like a golden bell, I'm heavy in my heart
And when I think of you boy I tremble, and the bell swings and rings
Sonia, Sonia
