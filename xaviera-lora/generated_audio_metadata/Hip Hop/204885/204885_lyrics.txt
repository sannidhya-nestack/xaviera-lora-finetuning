I know it's been a minute since you heard from me
I used to drop the records every day of the week
But I chill for a second cause the word in the street
Is that I lost the fire
Name ain't on flyers
No headliner is giving it up
But I been in the lab just cooking it up
And it's not in my power to leave the scene
And where's my Rodgees he on the team
What's Nakura, he's always dipped out
Where's the album, is it shipped out
Who's he dating, with whom he got problems
Didn't do bonafide, does he like arson
Face on a card and it can't be found
I beg your pardon, I'm still around
Got plaques on my wall and it's shiny though
The foundation believes so they gave me those
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Let's dismiss all the rumors you get
Did you see me in Maratos and drinks with Chris
And you see me in the blues sporting a current fit
Don't worry about the chicks that don't concern the hits but
When I spit yo I got to burn
You can read the magazine saying it's my turn
I was selling my tapes when you was counting your fingers
Third grade math problem I'm the reason you promote shows
I open the door now you wanna swallow the key and lock me out
Box me out
And you can't knock me out
Still firm like concrete
Y'all really want beef?
Don't risk it
Your vest is thin
Place your cards on the table
I told you then
T-Double's classic
Your style is Jurassic
It's still fantastic
And they is what the class gets
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Is it good to you
Like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe
Can you feel the heat
Plus production who's doing this beat
No man can be that consistent with the heat
Plus where's the sheet is he writing his verse
I'm ten albums deep ain't no time for a curse
I'm snatching awards while you snatching a purse
Not too much work freestyle expert
I brought the town together I must confess
Electric lounge days with the unity fest
You ain't confusing me yet
See I'm focused clearly
Goals after goals get accomplished yearly
New South soundtrack y'all must hear me
T-Double did it again seriously
Is it me or is the town regroupin'
Approve the dub, place playlist the new one
First and best buy, maybe your next try
Check my reviews and they call me the flavor
Is it good to you, like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe, can you feel the heat
Is it good to you, like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe, can you feel the heat
Is it good to you, like it is to be
Can you feel the vibe, can you feel the heat
Is it good to you, like it is to me
Can you feel the vibe, can you feel the heat
