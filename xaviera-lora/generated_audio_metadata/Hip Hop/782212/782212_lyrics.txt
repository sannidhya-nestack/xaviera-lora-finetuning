Heaven cry
Heaven cry
Heaven cry
Heaven cry
May I expose these lyrics I know deep inside of my soul
Only a few will plug in to hear it
Cause mama told me it's a full moon
When I breathe the same air as my enemies
So high can the faithful be real to the realest
When we all rolled up as one in the same blood
Then I can hold smoke so I can see my demons
Circling me maybe I cry now
And wonder why God is watching
Maybe I'm a lost seed ready to sin out of my misery
'Cause love knows I'm a sinner, strapped with two clocks
Blast on my tragedy's, when the twirl like it gives no iveness
I saw my homie shot twice in the head, heard how his memories bled
I smoked weed to celebrate his resurrection
feel me homie, he ain't dead, he free
I just hope death have the same love for me
Hope death have the same love for me, when heaven cries
Heavy cry
Heavy cry
So why in the hell we stuck in word bullshit
When society got mug shots and niggas throw stones at the jail
I thank God for a nature of men
Every time I tell a fake bitch to bend over maybe it's coded a lie
When death on the shoulders of a starving seed
Will he wait to see what this truly mean
When God bless the holy spirit cause evil ways is coming for niggas in they dreams
Woke up to have six shots and hit a C taking it hard to believe
It's a cold world when we ive in time
Cause the world is suffering how these niggas got these niggas mind
When projects are still crying for the welfare check
I wait for the tears to dry
Cause it's hopeless cause the future still no bigger than me
I saw sisters prostitute to get their mouths to feed
They got mouths to feed
My head will cry
My head will cry
Heavy grind
All my niggas out there
Happy Crime
So I ask why survive to make some of us bleed
I hope God be the one to tell it
Cause I flesh if my flesh
My blood is my blood
And if I sip the same wine
Maybe the music could just define the real niggas
Let what's seen be the crooked
And let him without sin cast the first stone
Cause I see the world full of willing lynchins
I guess that's why so many of my niggas in the cemetery
When we all got drunk minds with Happy Crime
Heavy crime, all my niggas
Heaven cry, so high long we didn't take defeat
Souls that's been dead for years, when I never had a chance to grow
Sometime when I'm in my car, roll down the window
Then let the misery and escape the weedy smoke
To ease my mind of a soldier, when I live like always
Because I feel death calling, I had a few close in common
Now who's stalling, cause every nigga on my block still live to being shot
Cause they can't sleep when they on watch
Maybe I get high, help a nigga pass the time
And pray in all my enemies that she a living and never die
We heaven cryin' through all the pain and misery
Heaven cryin' through all the pain and the misery
Heaven cryin' I heaven cryin'
Through all the pain and the misery, heaven cry
For all my niggas watch the government, heaven cry
For all my niggas out there trying to strut, heaven cry
For all those sisters out there that got miles to feed, heaven cry
Y'all get y'all stuff, heaven cry
