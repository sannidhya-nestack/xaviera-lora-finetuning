This is Co-Anthony Brownsville, Channel 9-11, here in the heart of America
Today we're talking about society, how we are struggling as a country
It's like something tearing or pulling at the very seam of the American dream
I think we really have to start to look into this thing because we're on the border of too late
Keep your ears tuned to 9 /11, here in the heart of America (As the sun here rises, his feet hit the floor)
(Don't really go to school, but he gotta hit that front door)
(Meet them fellas at the bus stop, they plottin' to jack)
(Need some courage, by 7 .30 they shakin' the sack)
(Caught his buzz, but all of a sudden this bitch was movin' slow)
(Heard the shots from the drop, time by that time, he hit the floor)
Yeah them cats up the streets, last week they had beef
Plus they holding the grudge, you know we lock down the streets
Yeah revenge is the ultimate weapon here in the ghetto
Hurt my pride, you gotta die, it ain't cool, no I can't let go
So we plotting to make his heart stop beating
Give his team a reality check and make his mom stop eating
It's like Shoji Cabana, snatch him up in the collar
We play for keeps on my streets, when I creep you gon' holler
Couldn't see nothing, he's clutching on the side of the stretcher
Last words you recall, told you cats I wet ya
Joe bars and hood scars in his past, what's in his future
No love from the hood, here's a pamphlet on how they do ya
Now they at the club, as if nothing had happened
That's when them killers walk in, scopey models start cappin'
Knockin' over the tables, grabbin' girls for protection
Hit you mothers in the white dome cars, they catch'em
Shorties wanna be hardcore, but I can't see it, think it's a joke
Get your Metro paper and read it, I'm in the motel
California, I'm in the motel
California, I'm in the motel
California, I'm in the motel
California, I'm in the motel
In the motel, California
In the motel, California
Swerving down 75, tears in my eyes
Finally came to the conclusion, we living to die
I know I'm not the only one who feels that fact
Maybe I am the only one that's being
My heart's on overload, another tale of bad news, I just might explode
Sorry to hear it, the story goes, but when the doors close
Who's here? Nobody but me to carry my load
Lord help me, I keep hating
But it's bouncing off the ceiling, coming back at me
Yo, I freeze for a second and turn on the tube
Rushed by the unbearable news of shooting at school
Another baby's born addicted to blow
How it get into a system?
Yeah, you already know
Let's check out that same system
You see what they give'em?
A legal prescription
Keeps'em high, now that's prison
I'm in the motel (na-di-di-di)
California (na-di-di-di)
In the motel (na-di-di-bi)
California, I'm in the motel
California, in the motel
California, la-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, I'm in the motel
California, in the motel
California, in the motel
California, is it really
The land of the free, home of the brave
I wonder how many times this gon' get played
Knew it was over when them planes hit the Twin Towers
It shook us for hours, the world traced it up
Maybe the Oklahoma bombing cast
Claimed that they should dime it but they can't feel common
Terrorists attack those who die, see you in heaven
Stayin' on the guard, never another 9 /11
I'm in the motel, California
I'm in the motel, California
I'm in the motel, California
I'm in the motel, California
America has never been the type of country that didn't rise to the occasion
You're wondering, where has all the hope gone?
