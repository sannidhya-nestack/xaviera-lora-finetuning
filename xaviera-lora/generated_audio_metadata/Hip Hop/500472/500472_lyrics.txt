All I came to say is hold tight'til you see
Here's the game you came to see
And it will put you all on your feet
I'm the winner, I got game in me
in me there is no word defeat
Now rise up people and shout out loud with me
You're here and you came to enjoy a winning game (hey)
All I've come to do is play hard
Show you all my moves and know-how's
I'm no joke people, I've got game
Come on and watch me'cause I'm a winner
You come to see me play and win
I get paid to draw you in
I'm a smooth player with mad skills
You must trust me cause I'm a winner
All I've come to do is play hard
Show you all my moves and know-how's
I'm no joke people I've got game
Come on and watch me cause I'm a winner
My game will show you I'm a winner
No doubt about it I'm a winner
It's deep in my heart I'm a winner
See it's just not talk I'm a winner
The speed of my feet is like a Ferrari
And I come down hard like Mario Andrade
Don't et about Jerry Rice
He was an NFL winner
But now it's my game and now I'm a winner
I'll leave you in shock
And you won't believe'til the game is over
Like Dirk Nowitzki, I'll just have to show ya
All I've come to do is play hard
Show you all my moves and know-how's
I'm no joke people I've got game
Come on and watch me cause I'm a winner
You come to see me play and win
I get paid to draw you in
I'm a smooth player with mad skills
You must trust me cause I'm a winner
I'm a winner, far from beginner
From January to December
My team gets a ring or a trophy if it's necessary
We the best, legendary
Our opponents is very scary
Let me show you my know how so you can know what
A winner feels like what you lose so you cold like a winter night
I got game so I never slip and everything we do is big
All I've come to do is play hard
Show you all my moves and know-hows
I'm no joke people, I've got game
Come on and watch me'cause I'm a winner
You come to see me play and win
I get paid to draw you in
I'm a smooth player with mad skills
You must trust me'cause I'm a winner
All I've come to do is play hard
Show you all my moves and know-hows
I'm no joke people, I've got game
Come on and watch me'cause I'm a winner
You come to see me play and win
I get paid to draw you in
I'm a smooth player with mad skills
You must trust me'cause I'm a winner
