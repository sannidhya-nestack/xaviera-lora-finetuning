For all of those who feel the flavor tight
My rhyme style is lava than MacGyver or the X-Files
White heads pile I maintain remaining complex child
I take aim at the same no game
Lame brain cats I spoke about and it's a shame
It's just lame I split your frame cause pain like flames go to hide from molten lava rocks
You take more shots than paparazzi cops on the block
Your order stop I got a lot
Sight swipe you like an Autobot
And saw the hot kids get cooled off with acid water drops
And as a slaughterhouse I got more of a stock
Cut you in half like halter tops
And expose you to shit that's sure to rock
Get off my jock, stop cock blocking the flock
When it's time for boost to get knocked
I get around like Pac, I bump knuckles like Fox
Stay fab like Freddy Five
My clicks are ready live, we flow smooth and steady
No jobs surviving it
The millennium is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up
Yo as my vocals get thrust
From this old school comes a new degree, H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-OP
My track disinfects the wack rapping sex that lack intellect
You cats tried this in a vet but y'all missing a step
Those who slept are now in a permanent hibernation
They'll only be awakened by the quake of the earth's melodic vibrations
Sensations felt by all persuasions are amazing
My mind at times racing, I rock the nation with no complication
Occupation, dopamine C, known to vocally overthrow and oversee
Those who supposedly hold the key force you to notice me
Till you beg me to stay like Jodeci
I let the beat take a hold
'Til it's controlling me, totally a hip-hop radical
I rip shop emphatically, the kid stops to batter you
This shit drops dramatically
Anatomy more than tragically staticky
Y'all gradually becoming casualties just for the salary
Don't be mad at me, y'all should be glad to see an MC
In reality, I break it down like gravity to the T
Mother's the top caliber MC who got it locked like Attica
On point when I kick like Automatica, Grammatica
From this old, old school, school comes, comes a new degree
H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-B, H-I-P, H-O-P
From this old, old school, school comes a new degree
H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-P
See I proceed to free the mind with rhymes that define freedom I shine
The lines I speak you find a lead in the blinds
Seeking you fine you need techniques that freak three different kinds
To reach the rhymes and speak in the vine
Best believe I'm leaving behind those that's weak in the spine
If you see the signs we left in the lines to read between them next time
You'll see I have neither the time or patience
For fake smiling faces who's style is tasteless
I run with a pile of aces and you all about
Whips and chains like a dominatrix
My squad responds with basics old school icons and asics
Bring it back like British knights
The kid's the type that when he get a mic he spit it right
Plus I'm attacking ya with his spectacular vernacular
And rack scratch with a tactic that'll make you flip like a spatula
From the slow, slow, slow school
School comes a new degree
H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-B, H-I-P, H-OB
From the slow, slow, slow school
School comes a new degree
H-I-P, H-O-P, H-I-P, H-O-B, H-I-P, H-O-B
Just that
Just that
Just right
For all of those who feel the flavor's tight
It's just that, it's just that, it's just right
For all of those who feel the flavor's tight
