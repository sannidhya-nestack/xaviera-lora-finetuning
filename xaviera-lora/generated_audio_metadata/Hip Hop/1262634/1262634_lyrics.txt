Watch your mouth, it's running wild
Need to watch your tone, you're like a child
Every word you say, it's like a stone
Echoes inside my head, I'm feeling so alone, alone, alone
Watch your mouth, running wild
Need to tone it down, I'm telling you child
Every little sound, it cuts so deep
The words like a knife, they make me weep
I weep, I weep
Can you hear me now?
I'm calling out loud
Need to learn control
Don't talk so foul
Watch you mouth
Running wild
Need a Tony John
I'm telling you child
Watch your mouth, it's never gonna get you
Watch your mouth, it's never gonna get you
Watch your mouth, running wild
Need to tone it down, I'm telling you child
