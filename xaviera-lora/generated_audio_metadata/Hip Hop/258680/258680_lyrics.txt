I don't know how to talk to this girl, she's something special to me
But if you feel like you have a girl in your life and you want to treat her better
You can't say to yourself, man, I'm doing right
What a shame, your pride, check it
I want to be with you, I want to get next to you my lover
You know me love you girl
You know I want you girl
I wanna see you through
I wanna get next to you somehow
You know I love you girl
You know me want you girl
You know there was a time
And I could stay with you (Wake up, wake up)
For the rest of my life
And I'll be here with you (here with you girl, here with you)
I hear with you, baby what you do?
I was the type of girl I didn't even wanna leave you girl
Boss up on the club girl, I make her want to drop you girl
I like the way you move and talk to me
You got something to me
I couldn't feel your vibe, couldn't even close to shit
She has something that can kiss upon me
Something that she can't depress upon me
She has a thing that can make you wanna fall upon me
I couldn't feel it girl, I couldn't understand tell me why
I wanna talk to you
I wanna know what's on your mind right now
You know tell me one what's on your mind girl
I wanna know the truth
I wanna know you need me too right now
I wanna know you got your name in it too
You know there was a time
And I could stay with you
For the rest of my life
And I'll be here with you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna know what's on your mind right now
I wanna see you through
Wanna know what's on your mind right now
