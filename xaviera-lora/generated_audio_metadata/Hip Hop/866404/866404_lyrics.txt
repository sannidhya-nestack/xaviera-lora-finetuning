I came from nothing, now I have plenty
Pockets full of pennies, no longer pennies
Income gets some, six figure steady
Married to the money and I don't need no wedding, yeah
I have so much in store
I will always want more
the hunger stays inside of me
I've been having the time of my life
Started being real broke now finally my money right
Used to pray through the night that one day I could afford a new Ford four door spotty
Barely keepin' on the lights workin' hard plans hardly workin'
Had Google but wifi so bad it was hardly searchin'
Had to come up real fast when the cash so urgent
Guess it was the hustle that fueled me
Yu-Gi-Oh! rappers in the game wanna duel me
Girls who ditched me years ago say they love me but they can't fool me
Certain shakes will stay forever for diamonds and rubies
With us I wouldn't trade this life for anything
No one could have guessed my position according to my pedigree
Mama told me to never settle for less than everything
Cause when you're riding up hill you can't stop peddling
Start myself up the riches till my music begins selling
After which I continue to stay relevant
Elevated to the pinnacle of the rap in this genre
Gotta do what it do
When you chase the natural disease Thomas
I came from nothing, now I have plenty
Pockets full of long long pennies
Income get some, six figure steady
Marital and money yeah, I don't need no wedding yeah
I have so much in store
I will always want more, cause the hunger stays inside of me
Paradise I chased it, food I never wasted
Dollars hard to come by, I'm a Lambo used to be a Hyundai
Washer, rapper, shorty leaves me fungi
But still in my homies when the sun rise
No new friends, I'll mess with a bad chick sometimes
Back in the day I made choices that were unwise
Thank God I was raised away from gun crime
Cash comin' in fast, hard to handle
Music business sure was a gamble
Soon a war's gonna come up with my mantle
What I'm spittin' here is only a sample example
Of what's to come before I'm dismantled from the throne
Matter fact I doubt that ever happens
But if it does for the new king I'll be clapping
I respect those who take action
Instead of those who just keep yappin'
Singing trash is just a ratchet
And I'm just a blackness that rose from the ashes
Who got protected through rushed hour traffic
That'95 show was a hassle
Grew up in the suburbs with half empty cupboards
What life has become nothing short of summer
I came from nothing now I have plenty
I can fall over there's no longer pennies
In time get some six figure steady
Married to every money and I don't need no wedding
I have so much in store
I will always want more
Cause the hunger stays inside of me
