Did you ever have a wish for a girl who could inspire? A two thousand years itch of hella hot desire?
Let me introduce you please to a girl who fits the bill, I think she fits the little fat pill
She's a sight to see, miss money, a smile worth more than I ever thought it could ever be
She's shots in her high heel shoes, life's gotten better, she got everything to lose
Fashion so fly, you have to get a airplane seat at what cost?
Lost a pretty penny
Come and get some, would you like a little treat?
Turning heads everywhere, trust me
There are very, very many
She's a little more than filthy rich
One tough bitch, welcome to the sweetness
Oh, Miss Money
Yo, I'm sexy, sweet honey
Is it fame that you adore? (This money)
Now you got a little, would you like a little more? (This money)
Sweet little honey, I can see that you are vexed
Take a minute, check your mobile, tell me if you got my text
Flexible finessin', I can see that you've been messin' with some things
I think you think that you've never seen before
She's got a wallet that is quite the little fatty
Generous, she is very, very, very catty
Buying up the love, it's something that she can't ever seek to get enough of
Of a swipe of a card like the play of a card
Crashing it very hard in the market for a heart
Oh, Miss Money
You're a fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be
A significant other person to a person in your life
Maybe you're a girlfriend, maybe you're a wife
Miss Money
Oh, she's no dummy
Buys love but it's never ever chummy
With a twinkle of greed in her eyes
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
She's got a stockpile of sweet admirers
They're all just the assets that are fueling her desires
She trades her kisses on the Dow Jones market
Her love's an investment not selling just a pocket
Her laughter rings like a cash register chime
The love's a currency she can't seem to mine
A portfolio of hearts, oh, and a portfolio
But the dividends of love she'll never really know
Miss Money, oh, she's no dummy
Darling's love but it's never ever chummy
With a pickle of green in her eye
She's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
Oh, Miss Money
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh, how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much, miss money
Oh, the irony's not lost, can't budget for love
It's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in the market of hearts, of this school
Failure, torn apart, but oh Ms. Money
You're still a sight in the cold hard cash of the night (oh Ms. Money)
You're a fantasy, I think about you everyday
I wonder if you will ever be a significant other person to a person in your life
So here's to Ms. Money
The bell of the ball, may your assets be liquid
Own this money, your fantasy, I think about you every day
I wonder if you will ever be a significant other person to a person in your life
A market of romance, she maneuvers with ease
But her assets are cold, they'll never please
The capital of her heart is in a deep freeze
But oh, how she'll spend to seize
She's a penny pincher with a golden touch
But the cost of love, it seems too much, miss money
Oh, the iron is not lost, can't budget the love
It's an endless cost
Now she's bankrupt in a market of hearts
A fiscal failure torn apart
But oh, miss money, you're still a sight
In the cold hard cash of the night
Miss Money, the bell of the ball, may your assets be liquid
Oh, Miss Money, the bell of the ball, may your assets be liquid
With a tickle of greed in her eyes, she's a fiscal fairy fluttering by
So here's to Miss Money, the bell of the ball, may your assets be liquid
Oh, Miss Money, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Miss Money, oh-oh-oh
