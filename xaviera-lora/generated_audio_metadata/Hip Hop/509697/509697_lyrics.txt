Justice needs to be served (that's what I'm talking about)
Y'all know who the true villains are (uh-huh) don't play stupid (RIP) let's go
I'm ready (villains) to take over (justice)
Sometimes there's things we just can't do (needs to be served) but we have to fight for it
Yeah, uh, RIP, come on
So all the people out there that was killed innocently, unarmed
Shouldn't happen
Hey this one's for you Oscar Grant
Rast away
Rest in peace
The government works sometimes
Villains deserve justice
Let's go
Throw my hands in the air pray to God and scream
Can we all just get along like Rodney King
As I walk down the street I see the oddest things
In the day to day drama everybody brings
Oh there obviously seems to be a lack of unity
And 85 % of a black person
Community if you tired of the gunpackers and crack traffickers
What you gone do? Go back to Africa
Your friends will probably get mad or laugh at ya
I hope this rap might get through to half a ya
Y'all have to squash it before another brother die in
You gotta squash it before some other mother cry in
Stop the violence, decrease the peace, decrease the beasts
The cops are firing, lots of sirens
From street to street
You don't wanna see a piece in a box or like it
So just squash it, just squash it, dude squash it, girl squash it
You gotta squash it, just squash it, don't lose your life over nonsense
So just squash it, just squash it, dude squash it, girl squash it
You gotta squash it, just squash it, don’t lose your life over nonsense
A few tears leave innocent black man shot last New Year's Eve
Oscar Grant, Adolph Grimes, Robby Toland, now they offline
Police departments too, they solve crimes, yes
Except the ones they cause, pause
I'm a diva speaking on a touchy subject
I feel like you, there must be justice
I feel for my brothers when they gave away their judge
Send them on a trip, no travel agent
And if they can't get it, then they can't get it
Can't have him caged in (then what?)
They prefer him to have a grape
Damn, I got a real gift in the will to live (so I)
So I will spit and you're fillin' it (and you kill kids)
When you kill kids they get militant
The people know who the true villain is (I know who it is)
So just watch it
Just squash it (squash it)
Do squash it (squash it)
Girl squash it (squash it)
You gotta squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Don't lose your life over nonsense
So just squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Do squash it (squash it)
Girl squash it (squash it)
You gotta squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Don't lose your life over nonsense
Life's a breeze with the dust and leaves thrust in it
Just in it for the ride we fly trust in it
A gust in it off course
No remorse or support for the laws of court
Justice just ended
With inadequate habitats for humanity
Can it be to panic frantically we must end it
Not when did we lost floating vibe with an open eye
I see darkness clearly while I'm open live
My city's filled with triple beams that trickle green
Down through the hood we should be tickled pink
But there's never enough
We wind up with crippled teens, everybody making waves
We stuck with ripple streams, no flow to the current
Tryna live concurrently, what's the problem?
Currently they blame currency
How many times can we really go and turn the cheek?
It's time for a stand, can't let the man go and burn the streets
Just squash it (squash it)
Do squash it (squash it)
Girl squash it (squash it)
You gotta squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Don't lose your life over nonsense
So just squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Do squash it (squash it)
Girl squash it (squash it)
You gotta squash it (squash it)
Just squash it (squash it)
Don't lose your life over nonsense
