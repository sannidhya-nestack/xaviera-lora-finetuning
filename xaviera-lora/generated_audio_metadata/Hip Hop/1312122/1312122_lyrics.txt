I catch my silhouette, flick the switch so aligned
Confidence in my pocket, reflection in my mind
Eyes trace the outline, no flaws left behind
I'm vibin' with the rhythm, no caution to rewind
Mirror mode, I'm feelin' this view
Every angle crisp, fresh and true
Style so steady, it's nothing new
Mirror mode, I'm seeing it through
Running through the day, not a worry in sight
Smile in my posture, I'm holding it tight
Friends wave hello, but my eyes shine bright
Listen to the music riding that daylight, yeah
Mirror mode, I'm feeling this view
Every angle crisp, fresh and true
Style so steady, it's nothing new
Mirror mode, I'm seeing it through
Step by step, watch my vibe keep pace
Confidence grows, I'm holding my space
No outside pressure, I'm freeing this place
Reflecting each second, it's written on my face, yeah
Mirror mode, I'm feeling this view
Every angle crisp, fresh and true
It's down so steady it's nothing new
Mirror mode I'm seeing it through
I hold that mirror close I see what I found
In the voice humming I'm safe and sound
Mirror mode, the gaze on my side
Every reflection, I let it guide
Settled in my flow, I take it in stride
Mirror mode, always amplified
