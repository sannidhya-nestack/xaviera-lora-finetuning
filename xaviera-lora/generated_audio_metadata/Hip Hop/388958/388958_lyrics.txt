Don't waste my time
Tell me what you wanna do
It's not a crime
Come and show me what a freak can do
If you want it
I'll put it on the plate for you
Get right up on it (on it, on it)
Let your fingers talk
I wanna feel them warmth
Come and play (my highway)
Come and play my way
We can play (a whole day)
All day, all day
But you're burning extra mine (but you're burning extra mine)
We can wait (we can grind)
It's just my style
I truly love to speak my mind (speak my mind)
Don't be surprised
I'm like an open book
Come on and take a look
Let's play a game
Just fantasize and call my name (name)
Just squeeze me tight
Melt away into the night
Oh, my highway (you're my day, my way)
We can play all day (all day, all day)
But your body next to mine (but your body next to mine)
We can wait, we can grind
Come and play, my way
Come and play, my way
We can play, all day
All day, all day
Put your body next to mine
Put your body next to mine
We can win, we can grind
Come and play
My highway (to the play, my way)
We can play a whole day (all day, all day)
But you're burning next to mine (but you're burning next to mine)
We can play, we can grind
My, my, my highway (to the play, my way)
We can play a whole day (all day, all day)
But you're burning next to mine
