Why's the door open? What is going on here? Huh, no way
Somebody went in my house? So I'm just gonna come back from vacation and this is what I find? Wow, it's crazy
Something's not right here, why's the door open?
I went and closed it, underneath it's straight smoking
Feel that draft or nah, probably think I'm joking
I wish I was too, that ain't the case though
Why my living room smelling like a K-Fo?
I'm tryna piece things together but missing legos
Blood on the floor
But who does it belong to? Body parts too, let me call the fuzz
Pentagrams drawn out on my white rug
The paint glow in the dark, I hit the light switch
But there's a slight twist, they done broke the bulbs yo
Left the circuitry, you can see the ohms float
Grab a flashlight now I see a poem
That was written on a scroll saying I just sold my soul
So that's what happened here
Whatever whispered in my ear got me tingling with fear
It's a madhouse up in here
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
Where you gon' run, where you gon' hide?
I don't really know but I'm locked inside (puzzles)
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah, yeah
I feel a drive but they leave nothing open
So I look around just to find the window broken
Stumbled upon a syringe someone must been doping
Writing on the shattered glass couldn't really quote it
Esoteric symbols that I seen before
I'm wishing this was all I saw but wait there's more
Books of magic and witchcrafts and inverted crosses somebody lost it
Is that a finger? Right next to a goat head?
And a dead chicken placed atop a skull head?
Sacrifices, these are my devices
YouTube a lot but I ain't seen nothing like this
Images of the great beasts in Baphomet
I'm telling you this wickedness is just bottomless
I feel a presence in the room, I wanna go now
I got company, someone kick the door down
It's a madhouse up in here
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
Where you gon' run? Where you gon' hide?
I don't really know but I'm locked inside
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
Police everywhere, so I hit the ground and
They got guns out, yelling, "You're surrounded !"
But this is my house, why they do me like this?
The Miranda rights ring as I'm being cuffed
The other cop in my ear like, "You outta luck !"
Gun to my head, told me keep my mouth shut
This is injustice, I just discovered this
Told'em gotta call my lawyer on the double quick
As they take me to they car I see bystanders
Duck my head to save face cause I got standards
Why everybody seem content I don't get it
I don't sweat it though I got bigger problems
I hit the station and everybody celebrating
Satan is demonstrating I'm perplexed yo
Praising me telling them I should be let go
Got the weirdest feeling there's something I don't know
Bill was a no go lawyer was a no show
Said he couldn't represent another logo
I called my fam and they smiting me right on the phone
Standing in awe like what the fuck is going on
In the interrogation room they ain't playing fair
Saying I'm a liar so they gotta take it there
Saying they got me on camera beyond living
Fingerprints match the crime scene they say I did it
It's a madhouse up in here
It's a madhouse up in here
Where you gon' run, where you gon' hide
I don't really know but I'm locked inside
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
It's a madhouse up in here
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
Where you gon' run or where you gon' hide
I don't really know but I'm locked inside
It's a madhouse up in here, yeah
