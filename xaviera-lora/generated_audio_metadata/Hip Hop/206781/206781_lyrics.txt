Southside, nigga what you wanna do?
I'ma tell you lil something bout my crew

Guaranteed to have the sound to make the pavement crack
You better take your windows and lock your doors
We ain't never gonna stop and we coming for more

You better recognize before you get hit
Cause uh, we got the bomb
It's time to drop the bomb

I know you feel it, we got the bomb, it's time to drop the bombs

Give me what you got cause I be ready for war
I'm coming kicking in your door man bringing the roll
You know I'm getting it spitting it flipping it see how I'm hitting it
My game strong so you know I come equipped
Set ready to trip check the manuscript
Cause now the bombs lit and we ready to flip
We riding heavy and we packing a load
We got a real short fuse and it's time to explode
I know you feel it, we got the bomb
It's time to drop the bomb
Yeah we got the bomb
And we got the bomb, it's time to drop the bomb
And we got the bomb, we got it, let's shoot some (check my thing back)
It'll be the night when we turn up them lights
We got the block on fire and we getting that hype
That's what them bombs do when you let them explode
You hear the fans screaming on the side of the road
We out of control to hurt the competition
No we can't flinch and stop looking listen
Proceed with caution when you step in the zone
I gave you fair warning and now it's on
I know you feel it, we got the bomb
It's time to drop the bomb, yeah we got the bomb, we got it, let's shoot it, I know you feel it
