City streets, cobblestones, old town booze they callin'
Corner stoops, skyline dreams, life ain't easy
From the harbor to the hood, stories told and understood
Old Bay Steam, living it, living that dream
From Fals Point to Canton Square
History whispers everywhere
Old brick buildings, tales unfold
Fast nights, hearts so bold
O's and Ravens, colors fly, hope and pride never die
Through hard times, we all stand, City Blues give it up
In Patterson Park the kids they play
Dream of better days
Across the streets of Painting Row
Love and strength they always show
From Fels Point to Canton Square
History whispers everywhere
Old brick buildings, tales untold
Fast knights, hearts so bold
Hearts so bold
That's right, hearts go boom
