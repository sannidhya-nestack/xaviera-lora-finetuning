You just target practice
Still getting money you can hate it if you want I
Get dough you can hate it if you want I'm a killer with the flow
You can hate it if you want you can hate it if you want
You can hate it if you want still getting money you can hate it if you want I
Get dough you can hate it if you want I'm a killer with the flow
You can hate it if you want you can hate it if you want
You can hate it if you want
You hate to see someone that's coming up from nothing
Love to see a man and his family struggling
They keep trying to push me, my sanity's bubbling
I got to blow up, take a stand, it be something
And I'm bout to go hard, despite the cost
Trademark the label like it's Microsoft
Even though I might have to go and fight the law
I'll stand up to anything that's twice as tall
You chummy ass kids can't wait for a contract
Same dummies ain't making no contacts
Talking bout you be taking it to combat
My flows full of blunt smoke gave you a contact
Up is what you need to shut the fuck
I'm a professional, y'all just putt putt
You play too many games, you can't just duck slugs
You ain't going nowhere, I wish you much luck
Still getting money, you can hate it if you want, I get told, you can hate it if you want, I'm a killer with the flow, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want
Who owe me cash, I cruise on you cats
Your crew only prove that I boost up my stats
You better think before you do something silly
I'll fill up your belly like Machine Gun Kelly
Talking bout how I owe you from back in the day
Bitch you only rap for like half of the way
You kept punching in, you ain't master the phrase
You rather be fake, I just blast in your face
And we both know don't put the
Cash in the safe, plus I got life insurance like a strap in a waist
et about tomorrow, gotta have it today
I'm a killer with the flow, you just rapped for the fame
And your album ain't sold, you ain't push it enough
You're too sweet, really only good for a sugar rush
Blast shots, put the hammer back hot
I'll be damned if my ass ever have to get up
Still getting money you can hate it if you want, I get dough you can hate it if you want, I'm a killer with the flow you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want
All of a sudden you kids become sour
I'm surprised that your breath don't smell like gunpowder
Young in the game, I'm many moons older
Really all I need is a heavy duty holster
Get you some you want some dumb shit
I'll be double fisted like drinks and drumsticks
You can just mumble from under a trunk lid
Call you a bitch, you in dicks like the tongue kiss
I'll stitch your lips shut, insist to get bust
Assist a dick slut and get my shit sucked
Who been hollerin' my name, you can get it the same
I'll be aiming for your throat to put cash in the brain
I'm an entrepreneur, stop jockin' my manure
My plots, my maneuvers, bitch, I hustle cooler
Fuckin' with my bread'll get you shot with the rootin'
I'll be takin' care of biz, I'm not gonna screw up in'em
Still gettin' money, you can hate it if you won't die
Get told, you can hate it if you won't
I'm a killer with the flow, you can hate it if you won't
You can hate it if you won't
You can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want, you can hate it if you want
