I see your man at the bar gettin' panicky
Girls, black girls, Latinas, Puerto Ricans
Avatar, blue chicas, I don't care
I will freak ya
Just come get wrecked on the dance floor
And I will see ya
Cause in the club I'm a night vision heat seeker
I'll get down if you move into my territory
I will pounce on your body, I'm predatory
I am a tiger in the woods and I chase my tail
I'm running circles on his dance floor
Oh, it's amazing I can't let it go
Oh, you're so dangerous out of control
Dangerous, and you're killing me softly and slow
baby you're brutally beautiful
It's amazing, I can't let it go (hey)
You're so dangerous, out of control (hey)
Dangerous, killing me softly and slow
baby, you're brutally beautiful (oh, yeah)
Eight, seven, six, five
This is Skip, y'all
Four, three, two, one
This is, this is, this is how we do it, do it, do it
Crowd moving, moving, moving
Let's get down, let's get to it
When you come in, you look stunning
This whole crowd is astounded
Confounded, you upside down-ed
It's elevatin' your whole game, leaps and bounces
The whole club is jumpin', Jersey Shore, fists pumpin'
I wanna snatch somethin', this is Halloween lovin'
All the freaks are in the club, and all these booties look like pumpkins
I'ma carve me up one, I'll get your oven runnin' (Oh, oh)
It's amazing I can't let it go
It's so dangerous out of control
Dangerous, baby killing me softly and slow
Cause baby you're brutally beautiful
It's amazing I can't let it go
It's so dangerous out of control
Dangerous, baby killing me softly and slow
Cause baby you're brutally beautiful
Hey baby (hey baby) and I thought to you (you)
Saw you standing there (there) from across the room
This is, this is, this is how we do it, do it, do it
Crowds moving, moving, moving, let's get down, let's get tuned
I wanna get, I wanna get, I wanna get, ah ah ah
I wanna get, I wanna get, I wanna get, ah ah ah
You're in fuego, you hot potatoes
You want a pot of gold over the rainbow
I ain't no plain Joe, you ain't no Jane Doe
You got an ambiance like Beyonce's halo
You got a body like 90's J-Lo
I wanna squish it in my hands like Play-Doh
It's amazing, I can't let it go (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're so dangerous, out of control (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Dangerous (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh), and you're killin' me softly and slow (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
baby, you're brutally beautiful (hey)
It's amazing, I can't let it go (hey)
You're so dangerous, out of control (hey)
Dangerous, can't let me stop playing soft
baby, you're brutally beautiful (hey)
Hey
