Jesus is the way
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations,
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith will be the patience.
But let patience have no perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberty,
And abraideth not that it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations,
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh in patience.
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally,
And abraideth none, and it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations,
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worth the temptations.
But let patience have her perfect word, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally,
And the bread of man, that is shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
