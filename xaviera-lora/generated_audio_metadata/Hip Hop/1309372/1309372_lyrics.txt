Yeah, ay, she the quiet one
From a north town block where she might've come
Not a lot going on when it's all said and done but she the gold shit
Never gets cold with a heater undercoat and you never hear her speak
But that's what you need to know
Not a word when she locked and she trapped in that hole
We was tryna get inside and she was tryna leave us out
Ever since I moved supplies seen God like he pulled up out the sky
One try, one bench, one lay
Behind my city, I pop one night, two guns
Just feel them watching me die
We up next to the projects, roof up my block
How can I help you, life, did you ever get a lock
Overbody and mine, not this way for life
Not me, no this me, where they all falling line
It's all on my mind, all of them right here
She got the nine, who would've thought I'd play my part
Told her to leave me out, she had me attached
Never seen life, dancing away, running away
How you doing? It's what I thought
I'm training them you know that
So anybody kill a plan let's get it
I could talk it but I'd rather just listen
That's what she said
Put the 9 in the waist long range hit em all in the face
Probably done took over half of my city
Hey careful little one you drilling
You don't wanna die at the end of your strictly
That's type of lie will be revealed in a minute
I can see how God is just training the minions
Hope they pay attention if you had to kill any
You'd take one for the team and now you can't make amends
Now this is the end you know not to question
Every inch of her power
Hey you remember I laid in the gravel
The second she did and it gave me a sign
And she never said a word just pulled my brothers away
All my brothers away
All my brothers away
All my brothers away
All my brothers away
All my brothers away
Look, I'm that quiet voice, cold steel on my hip, no chatter needed when I move, man
People start to trip, kept the peace in the dark
But I'm done being silent, all these snakes in the yard
Got me turning defiant, I never trust a soul
So I'm rolling on my own, you can taught me how to thrive and I learned it on the go
Eyes everywhere, keep a watch if it's you and me together and we turn it up a notch
I'm a ghost with the nine, one spark is all it takes, I've been looking for a sign
When you came to my attention you'd acquired one love, but can we talk about redemption?
Oh, I miss you, babe
