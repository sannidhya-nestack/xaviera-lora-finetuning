Break bread with the enemy of the centipede
Tryna worry bout the end of things, infinity everlast
Not like a punching bag, more like an hourglass
Brought from divinity, see it like a simile
Simple line rhyming, poor timing, all biased
No lining, false science, no crying, no whining
You shimmering, you shining
While every beat I touch turn to gold like King Midas
Thinking that you better man, I beg for you to try this
Feel a lot different when the lights hit your iris
Especially when the crowd start acting like they Simon
Got you wanting to disappear like the Mayan
Now you lying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher be telling the truth and it hurts
Thinking that you in a pew just looking in a casket
Till you see it's you in a hearse and putting the dirt
Instrumentals I murk I'm going berserk
And I be putting in work I'm feeling my shirt
So wipe me down to the ground I'm bound to be perfect
In fact if you wanna connect I'm right here
Instrumentals I murk I'm going berserk and I be putting in work
I'm feeling my shirt so wipe me down to the ground I'm bound to be perfect
In fact if you wanna connect I'm right here
Reminiscing listening to cassettes in high chairs
While you lying like you selling authentic in Times Square
Crying cause you create a buzz for light years
And you trying to reach the top but you're not there
Yet you still wanna boat peep
the heat that you leak in the sheets
Like you gon' reach peak
But heed when I speak
That it's not a huge feat
You're a leech ass
But a gas in passenger seats
Class of synthetic is nylon
Why you wouldn't catch me dancing
My hands hit the pylon
Truth got nothing to lie on
But you got a better nail so let bygones be bygones
Keep the light on, I'm a master like Qui-Gon
In the box but try to stand out like a scion
No deny on, need a new hat to try on
Cause the crown make my forehead wrinkle like a Klingon
Instrumentals I murk, I'm going berserk
And I be putting in work, I'm feeling my shirt
So wipe me down to the ground, I'm bound to be perfect
If you wanna connect I'm right here
Instrumentals I murk I'm going berserk
And I be putting in work
I'm feeling my shirt so wipe me
Down to the ground I'm bound to be perfect
In fact if you wanna connect I'm right here
Instrumentals I murk I'm going berserk
And I be putting in work
I'm feeling my shirt so wipe me
Down to the ground I'm bound to be perfect
In fact if you wanna connect I'm right here
Instrumentals I murk I'm going berserk
And I be putting in work
I'm feeling my shirt so wipe me
Down to the ground I'm bound to be perfect
Fact if you wanna connect I'm right
