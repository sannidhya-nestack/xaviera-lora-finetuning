Uh, it's F .G., baby
Feel good, feel great
It's on your blade
Uh, you know
When the lights go out
Mama, let's break it down for'em
When the lights go out
And the night's gold
And I'm on my own
Now listen here, mama
It wasn't what you wore or didn't wear
It was the way you walk
The way you talk
Your eyes twinkle like midnight in New York
Hair wrap cascading down your profile
Highlighting your smile
It made it worth my while
On a summer night
Mmm, yeah
Yeah, the breeze was warm
You walked into this place
And changed my life
I knew you would
The only one
Like to take a chance
To be by my side
I'm tryna be next to you boy
When the lights go out
And the night is cold
And I'm on my own
When the darkness comes
I hide away
In your arms tonight
As the days go by
I still wonder why
Your silent words can make me cry
(I see your tears falling)
Those crazy games
Too many people play
Is a lesson learned
But I still need to try
(I learned my lesson but I ain't playing no games, boo)
when the lights go out
And the night is gold
And I'm on my own
(Doing the night, uh)
When the darkness comes (yeah, darkness)
I'll hide away (uh)
In your arms tonight (I'm in my arms)
Tonight (yeah, sing it baby)
Oh yeah, the night is gold (it's on your blade)
And I'm on my own
Top grade
When the darkness comes
When the darkness
When the darkness
I hide away
Yeah, don't hide too far baby
Uh huh
When the crying's done
And I felt the pain
Of losing someone
Don't you feel let down
Just try again, one day you'll find the one
When the lights go out, and the night is cold
And I'm on my own, and the darkness comes
I'll hide away, in your arms tonight
And I tell you how much I love it
Beyond death, beyond reason, beyond love's own power loving
Your name is like a golden bell, hung heavy in my heart
And when I think of you boy I tremble
And the bell swings and rings, Sonia, Sonia
