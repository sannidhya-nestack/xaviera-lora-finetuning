Can't stop won't stop can't stop won't stop can't stop won't stop yeah yeah yeah
Come at the bottom of the alleyways, lava the wreck from the city of fingers
Mo' bounce to the ounce, serve it up from minor to major, yeah
It's all about stacking paper, no doubt, serve it up in the mix
For the rockers, click Mavericks in the house
Set'em up in the west side, for the west side
Come cover the black clothes, that's right
It ain't all about where you're from, it's all about where you're at
Recognize where the wreck is going down
Pound for pound, fresh out the box, reckon money makes the world go round
Now to proceed with extreme caution is a must
Till I die, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Better price than repercussions, ain't no future in frontin'
Representin' down to the fullest, straight up 9-001-9
But ghetto stars see it's all good
Feel the way it goes, feel the way it shows through your neck of the woods
Now to commence the flow of the passion
So trick or treat, tell me how you like me now
Save it or rock us, puttin' it down with extreme caution
Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop
What can I say but that I'm in love with this rap shit
Perhaps to the fact I'm tapping ass while I stack chips
Nothing more better getting cheddar let alone with the cut up
Ain't nothing going on but the party let me blaze the butt up
Word up to all of my peeps from NYC to LA
For the east to the west nothing but love not a nothing dude
So why don't you bring it back, swing it back
Fresh out the west, stressed with constant threat
Nearing early death, now to proceed with extreme caution
There's a must, sharks in the dark
For the fact jealous and scandalous
Cautious, without cause, against all odds
Secrets in the dark, money talks
Bullshit walks, but baby don't see it's all good
For the way it goes, for the way it shows
To your neck of the woods
Now to commence the flow of the passion
So trick or treat, tell me how you like me now
Save it or rock us, putting it down with extreme caution
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop
Can't stop, won't stop Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop Tell me what the hell do you like me now?
Can't stop, won't stop How would you like it?
Where would you like it? Somebody tell me what the hell
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop
