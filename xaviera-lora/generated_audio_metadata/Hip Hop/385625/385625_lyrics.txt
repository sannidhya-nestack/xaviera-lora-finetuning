Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow ,to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, To the flow
Get low, get low
To the flow, to the flow (ay-ay-ay-ay)
Get low, get low (ay-ay-ay-ay)
To the flow, to the flow (ay-ay-ay-ay)
Get low, get low (ay-ay-ay-ay)
To the flow, to the flow (ay-ay-ay-ay)
You might catch me down south
Trapped in the club
I'm north in the Benz
Ridin' on dust
Out west with my fence
Protectin' my chest
On the east coast with my crew
You know what we do
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
To the flow, to the flow, wah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Get low, get low, wah-yah-yah-yah-yah
To the flow, to the flow, wah-wah-wah
Off in Africa, seated with the kings up in Canada
Doing time where it changed, in Detroit with Aretha
Blowing out some speakers, in Montana with Santana
On tour in some bleachers, I make you feel like you all good
No stress on your brain, I even sympathize with you
When your heart's in pain, bang your head up and down
This your thing, gon' do it, I'll be right here when you come back
So get used to it
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
I'm like Prius whistling, coming through headphones
At the opera in the hood, sitting on chrome
At your high school in the bedroom, that's where you might meet me
Even babies listen to me in their CR-IB
Yo Wapu, shake that thing, I'm looking and listening
Hustle to it, ballroom to it, yo, go do it
All in all is how you move, it gets in your soul
Put your hands up shake it like you 10 years old
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow ,to the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, To the flow
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, get low
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, what?
Get low, get low, to the flow, to the flow, what?
Get low, get low, to the flow ,to the flow, what?
Get low, get low, to the flow, To the flow, what?
Get low, get low, to the flow ,To the flow, what?
