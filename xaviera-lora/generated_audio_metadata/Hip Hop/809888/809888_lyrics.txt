Use it like a wave on your
Rolling over oceans and oceans
Let yourself feel free
As free as the air you breathe
Rotate
Let it be authenticated, baby
Every move
Every gyration
Boots and shoes
Come on, hit that groove
Show them what you're working with
And I loved you baby, I was sensible
I thought logical, I was a responsible brother
Your delusions almost shattered my being
You deceived me with pride
I'm not gonna stay in another sheet with you
You see it's time to celebrate
The exit of you out my line
Somebody out there still tuned out of date
There's no place for this nonsense in this beautiful world today
It has no place, put it away
