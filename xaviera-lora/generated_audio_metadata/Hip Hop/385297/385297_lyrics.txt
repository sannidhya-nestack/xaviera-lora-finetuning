Up against the wall where the thugs show their love at
Rolling out six deep in the old lack
Pockets full of grease, spend it on a whole sack
Nigga roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, nigga roll, east coast niggas just, nigga roll, west coast niggas just, nigga roll, down south niggas just, nigga roll
I be head wreckin' niggas, no joke, I'm on another page
Passin' all the blocks like Mo Stockett out of changement
Toe to toe in rounds I never missed a shot of reminiscin'
Times with Gap, Bad played on the spot (yeah)
It's been a long time since I never made a glance
Lookin' over shoulders but now they think I'm Superman (ha-ha-ha)
Get it right kid, you think I always do this shit
Standin'round the block with chalk, gold and fuckin' dread
That's the movie shit that makes you wanna flip
G e W. Bush gets the whole world to murder shit
A global war on the one who seeks a law
When my destitute is peaked and the rhymes are living large, yeah
Niggas on the globe, no stress on what they show ya
Half of them troops right now will die in torture
It's going to the limit, let Bush fight that for ya
We gotta take a stand on the one who does the storms, y'all
It's a war with a thug, show the love act, yeah, rolling out 60
Been the old lack, uh, pockets full of grease, spend it on a whole sack (uh-huh)
Nigga roll (like that, pass that)
Nigga roll (east coast niggas just)
Nigga roll (west coast niggas just)
Nigga roll (down south niggas just)
Here it is, raw talent, live in the flesh
Your test, peep holes found in your chest
I ain't gotta brag, what I do remains to be seen
So fresh, so clean, polka dot caps with red beans
Pizza lean in a 6-4, you copped in your dreams
Rolling on East Smith, you should sit in on pre-teens
Country ass nigga, with immaculate speech
Clutching large amounts of shit that be out of your reach
Late in the week, kept the shine to radiate
Through the mic rewind mind to learn game
It's just something to recite
Snatch up your girl and get her fix
Get up, front on the click, get Swiss cheesed up
Catch E, stomping in his Air Force 1
Better betcha gets to running when I pull this gun
Y'all niggas wanna shine high but you gets none
That's what your cowards get for tryna touch my ones
Up against the wall where the thugs show the love at, yeah!
Steep in the old Lack (uh)
Pockets full of grease, spend it on a whole sack (uh-huh)
Nigga roll (like that, pass that)
Nigga roll (east coast nigga shots)
Nigga roll (west coast nigga shots)
Nigga roll (down south nigga shots)
Nigga roll (midwest nigga shots)
Roll, roll, roll, roll
East Coast niggas just (East Coast niggas just)
West Coast niggas just (West Coast niggas just)
Down South niggas just (Down South niggas just)
Mid West niggas just (Roll up against the wall where the thugs show the love at)
Rollin' out six deep in the old lack
Pockets full of grease, spend it on a whole sack
Nigga roll, roll, roll, roll
East coast niggas just, west coast niggas just, down south niggas just
