Ay, ay, fresh breeze, clear mind
I'm feeling that solar sway
Check the morning rays
Touching down on my skin
No rushing my steps
Let the gentle day begin
Feeling light in my soul
No baggage within
I'm vibing with the sunshine
Wearing my own grin
Sipping citrus juice
And watch the scene unfold
All the colors of the day
Looking bright and bold
Got my girls on my line
Share a laugh uncontrolled
We thriving every moment
Let that story be told
I sway in the daylight
Free from all the noise
Emotions flowing easy like I found my voice
No walls around my heart, just an open choice
Soulless way, soulless way, let my soul rejoice
Soulless way, soulless way, let the golden warmth replay
Soulless way, soulless way
Feel the rhythm in my day
Let the breeze kiss my hair
Rockin' that carefree style
Ain't no limits on my mind
I'm cruisin' every mile
Floatin' through the crowd
With an effortless smile
Feels good just bein' me
Keepin' life versatile
Got a beat in my chest
Movin' steady and clear
Each breath that I take
It dissolves every fear
I'm findin' hidden treasures
In the world so near
Live it up in the sunlight
Keep the vibes sincere
I sway in the daylight free from all the noise
In motion slow and easy like I found my poise
No walls around my heart just an open choice
Soulless way, soulless way let my soul rejoice
Soulless way, soulless way let the golden ones replace
Soulless way, soulless way
Feel the rhythm in my day
Ey, ey, soulless way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ease my way
No clear, no grey today
Glowing bright, this is where I'll stay
And solar sway, yeah yeah, ease my way
Feeling clear, no gray today
Glowing bright, this is where I'll stay
