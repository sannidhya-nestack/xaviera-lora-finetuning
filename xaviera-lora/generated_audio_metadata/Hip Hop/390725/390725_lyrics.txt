Uh, yeah here we go y'all
It's time to get busy
Uh, we gonna tell'em how we live it
We're not truly taking lightly
We're too heavy, we don't do crack
We keep our weight steady at a minimum
The dark skinned brothers, ha, is what we're giving'em
With DJ Kareem upon the turntable
We're able to keep the crowd stable
Round and round, a funky beat goes
My rhyme flows to the beat he chose
I would like to propose a toast to a marvelous DJ
For the times he was on time
He never skipped while I flipped my rhymes
A dedicated brother
Through the movement
If there's a crowd, got my T-Karima moving
I'm proud to be a part of this entourage, but don't disregard
Yo, I'm still in charge
Beats unroaded, rhymes unfolded
Both big-boned and heavy, can you hold it?
He's the axe, I'm the axe-hander
We go off and come off tough and leave a scandal
The word spread fast, wherever we are
You better hold on to the woman tight
We're not to be taken lightly
We're not to be fucked with
And I'm proud to be stuck with a DJ
That can keep up with the time
His beats and my rhymes they fit
We're on a legitimate tip
We're like Flint
You get the hint baby, we're in
And you're nothing but a has-been
You're old news and we're the new trend
And it's not'cause of the color of our skin
It's'cause we been practicing
practice made perfect
Was long and hard
But nobody deserved it
Stuck together, but now we deserve it
Top notch, now wasn't it worth it? You say you gonna take us out? That's unlikely
We're not to be taken lightly
DJ Kareem, what's it all mean?
The way we get busy, it's all in the jeans
Seems like a dream, but it's reality
I'm dead serious, so yo don't smile at me
I'm in between a new jack and a veteran
I just started my reign
But yet I'm better than a lot of these suit groups
Possesin' weak troops frontin' like they got lube
But livin' like Froot Loof, to take it slightly
Is to underestimate, say you're professional but that's the amateur trait
You got to come great, be an expert
Perfectly matched, half step and get work
First I test my microphone
The DJ Kareem passed me a hype tone
Then I smiled cause I know
It's time to get wild
Here's my chance to just play and portray my style
Whatever topic's used
Whatever mic you choose
To abuse or bruise
You still lose
I'm like Swami
Predicting the future
Your future's in front and then I'm here to boot ya
Boot ya back to boot camp
Basic training
When the battle's done who's remaining
Kingdo V
And anything goes
I'll never stop ripping and flipping and curling your toes
You ever wanna battle
Don't invite me see
We're not truthy taking lightly
We're not truthy taking lightly
We're not truthy taking lightly
We're not truthy taking lightly
We're not truthy taking lightly
