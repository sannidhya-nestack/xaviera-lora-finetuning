I need y'all over here, I need the fellas over here, you got ID's no problem getting in, yo what's up niggas, y'all need y'all niggas to start it when we get out
Peep the night life, New York, Saturday night
We under the influence, surrounded by city lights
It's a club night tonight
Roll high percentage, I ain't even hit the door
Been through a fifth of privilege, I slid to the front of the club
Creamed out, head to toe in cashmere, Penwenty, Luomo
My routes already mapped out with optimism
Monotonous women are just thots with the venom of torn thighs
Without a doubt I'll get in'em
This ass water wall ain't no room for criticism
I'm in tune with the conditions
Money and drugs, music, women and thugs
I'm telling you cuz this shit is off the meter
From the bar to the latrine air full of second hand narcotics and heavy green
Get your drink on, it's gonna be a long night
I ain't even hit the bar and see something I like
Play the wall
Materialize my game, she holds caramel lines in an unprescribed frame
Now I'm wise with words that part dots in exchange
Gotta know where that spot is, later for the name
So I proceed every move done with prestige
I'm out the race, shorty corner the room a few degrees
Slit, spit my alias, put up the speed
You got something I need in them Victoria SD's
You wanna continue this talk a little more privately
Your skits, I'm in the VIP if y'all need me
This is for the niggas, the bitches, the chickens, the pigeons
The scrubs that get no love inside clubs for them willies
The women, the DJs, strippers, the bartenders pouring out liquor (yeah)
This is for them niggas, the bitches, the chickens, the pigeons, the scrubs
They get no love inside clubs for them willys
The women, the DJs, strippers, the bartenders pouring out liquor
Tipper
On my place at the bar I'm bout to set up shop
Fly nigga coming through with this slow ass prop
Only stop for fly bitches who love the whole cop
I got these chicks on lockdown before one o'clock
Pimping ain't hard it's easy
Take me on the floor and tease me, little fast ass flirting short skirt
Nigga flex got the jam moving all night long
Take shorty in the dark, slide over the thong
Ping pong for three songs, I'm back on the floor
Same chick best friend tried to back me out the door
Talent still a hood nigga, no quiz for me to piss
It's Henny rolling down my wrist, tits and ass and autographs from me
Find me in the cut rolling up Nestle
Another round for the click on sexy
Drop two G's just to impress me, I thought it was free
Niggas actin' tough on the wall, don't really wanna brawl
I can open the mall and roll heads like pool balls
Y'all better calm down for the mob, come on and get a drink
Take a little time to doze
This is for the niggas, the bitches, the chickens, the pigeons, the scrubs
The get no love inside clubs for them willys
The women, the DJs, strippers, the bartenders pouring out liquor (kids)
This is for them niggas, the bitches, the chickens, the pigeons, the scrubs
They get no love inside clubs for them willys
The women, the DJs, strippers, the bartenders pouring out liquor (tipper)
Yo it's a hot night, I can't complain
Call it my man, everything we lay down's going according to plans
It's mapped out kinda love love, the club crowded with hunnies
Niggas in the corner flash they money on some baller shit
Tryna pick up chicks, I remain lowkey, y'all niggas know me
In the cup with a Cosmo, tipping it up
At the bar with a shorty, y'all done picked that up
Time to fall back, regain the space I left
Get my pimp stroll on, shine the tide to death
Case the joint from one wall back to the wall
Underneath the booth then back to the bar
Get my drink on, we do this shit all night long
A dime behind the guard drunk screaming, "That's my soul !"
Throw that shit on, we hit the floor slow as a slug
MC bought that nigga cut a hell of a rug
Intoxicated with the sweetest taste of venom in the club
I'm faded they taking advantage so my dick they robbed
I don't mind son I love New Yiddy
My city in the club stay surrounded with dimes
It's Wild British for the mix
The bitches, the chickens, the pigeons, the scrub
They get no love inside clubs for them willys, the women, the DJs, strippers
The bartenders pouring out liquor, yeah this is for them niggas
The bitches, the chickens, the pigeons, the scrub
They get no love inside clubs for them willys the women, the DJs, strippers
The bartenders pouring out liquor, tipper
