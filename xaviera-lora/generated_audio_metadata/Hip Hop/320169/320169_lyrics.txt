I know it's only been a few months but feel me on this
Turn this up if you play it in your car
Windshield vibrating in your car
This one's for the lady in my car
I gotta let you know how special you are
We been good no stress so far
Of all the times in my life it's been the best so far
I remember the very second I saw
That you was much different than the rest of'em all
I first saw you at church on the first night
And then I saw you in the club on the second night
We didn't speak our first words'til the third night
So I guess I'll call it love at third sight
I fell in love as soon as I heard "Hi"
I'm flying high like a pony with a bird's eye
I'm so glad to this town I return, I
Never leave again, all I need is her and I
You and I can be together through whatever
And I will never leave your side
Leave your side
You and I can build a future
And I will never misuse ya
It's just you and I
You and I
I don't want to get dark
But I'm a dime deep down in my heart
There were things nearly tore me apart
There were times in my life I was pushed too far
But everything feels changed and better now
All the pain fades since you've been around
I ain't afraid to proclaim and admit it now
Everyday I embrace this beginning now
I'ma do what I gotta do
To make sure that I get this eagle out of you
Which is hard cause there ain't a whole lot of you
You bout the size and the shape of a bottle too
You're perfect I'm the man on the moon
Got a smile that's quirky but it's shining for you
It lights up my face when you walk in the room
It's like witnessing a living work of art in my view
You and I can be together through whatever
And I will never
Leave your side, leave your side
You and I can build a future
And I will never misuse ya
It's just you and I, you and I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I, you and I
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll get by, we'll get by, we'll get by, we'll get by, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey yeah, you got that one person in your life that you truly love
Gotta be able to look him in the eye every single day
And you gotta be able to tell him that you're gonna make the right decisions
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So I'ma say it right here
I got you, every single day, I got you
You and I can be together through whatever
And I will never leave your side, leave your side
You and I can build a future
And I will never misuse ya
It's just you and I, you and I
And you and I can be together through whatever and I will never leave your side, leave your side
You and I can build a future and I will never misuse ya, it's just you and I, you and I
