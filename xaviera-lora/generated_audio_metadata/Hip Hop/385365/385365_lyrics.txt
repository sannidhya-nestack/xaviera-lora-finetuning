All my homies, they be slingin' a rock show, and them honey's blazin' up in the spot show, all the niggas drop-droppin' a block show
Hey yo, step into the spot, strobe light, steady spinning
Spot this dime piece dressed up in silk, white linen
First approach, how you doing? What's your name? No combo
Go back, damn, reject the game
Second step, same spot, no girl to be found
Oh well, might as well keep walking around
Then it hit me, damn, right in front of my eyes
Five, six, jet black hair and caramel thighs
Last chance, last call, but alcohol was made
Step to her with two glasses of Alize
She's all into it, actin' like she wasn't
By the way, who you here with? You here with your cousin?
The vibe was cool, it's about to be on
Won't you grab your coat, yo, and let me take you home
She said, "Cool, let me tell my peeps I'm leavin'"
Wouldn't you know? Her cousin's the girl I hit last week (Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno)
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangria
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ria
All my homies they be slayin' the rock show
And them honeys blazin' up in the spot show
All the niggas drop top in the block show
Kenny Pearl hotbox in the box show
Now I'm dipping in the ride to ride to Crescent
Where to see my homie Nate Cole, crippin' the walk, you see ya
Niggas ball like bounce skate rock until we hoppin' off the block
Kocock the killin' county cops, it's in the city of South Central L .A.
Where homies like to grill and party and kick the floor plate
To camaradas and hiders that get the groove on, move on
Don't load, just get your groove on
It's out the fridge from 40 ounce to O .E. Schlitz
Malt liquor to St. Ives and long drinks
Chupa homies with Cadillacs and pump thrills
Three wheel rollin' with gold rims and candy pearls
He know it's all to hot spots and Ford Flicks
Night clubs runnin' and drink hoes and chop shit
Niggas come to rub a wrist with Double Down
Drank his last cup and it's all to get that party got
Soy barbichulo, yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangría
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ría
All my homies never slingin' them rocks, yo
And them honeys blazin' up in the spots, yo
All the niggas drop top in the block, yo
Kenny Pearl hotboxin' the Fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
Tengo plata y me fumo buenos puros
Con mis homies bebo mucha sangria
Quiero ver que todo el mundo se ria
All my homies they been slingin' them rock show
And them honey's blazin' up in the spot show
All the niggas drop-droppin' a block show
Kenny Pearl, Hotbox and the Fox show
Soy papi chulo, yo soy numero uno
