We riding
We riding
Be more we try and see more
Put it on the map so we could blow it up like C4
West side you know how we ride
Twelve o'clock boys and we stepping outside
Bring the bikes out lights out pop a willy
Quads yup squad up swag's on a milli
Swags on a billy, this really how we living
Until the ninth inning, the streets un iving
Off roads on the road, when incoming traffic
Swear something drastic, barely outlasted
Coppers stay harassing, pedestrians passing
Right by, no lie, we nice, never crashing
This our outlet, yes it is electrifying
Living in a broken city there is no stress when riding
No stress when riding, no stress when riding
That's how we get it everyday now the world's invited
Turn the keys, shift the gears, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Though it's real I ain't scared, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Death is near but I'm here, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
No fear over here, we ready to ride
We ready to ride, we ready to ride
Heard they got an APV on our ATV's
Parks said they out for blood, now we up to speed
Alone they could take me, but I got a team
They can't stop us, we outnumber them
All's fair in warfare this our hood
Call us thugs but we really just misunderstood
That's just the way it is this is all we know
I'm a chill when I'm dead but now I gotta go
Tell my kids how much I love them as I leave the house
The boys is playing for kicks that ain't just word of mouth
Love the way that engine sound when I rev it up
Crazy life we lead but you gotta give it up
Even though it's kinda wild, this is what we do
In this cold world, this is how we make it through
This how we make it through, how we make it through
This is everyday struggle that we bring to you
Turn the keys, shift the gears, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Though it's real, I ain't scared, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Death is near, but I'm here, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
No fear over here, we ready to ride
We ready to ride, we ready to ride
Old girl got me thinking'bout staying inside
I'm ready to ride, nope, I'm ready to ride
Mom Deuce got me thinking'bout staying inside, nope
I'm ready to ride, nope, I'm ready to ride
Old girl got me thinking'bout staying inside, nope
I'm ready to ride, nope, I'm ready to ride
Said mom Deuce got me thinking'bout staying inside, nope
I'm ready to ride, nope, I'm ready to ride
Turn the keys, shift the gears, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Though it's rare, I ain't scared, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
Death is near but I'm here, I'm ready to ride
I'm ready to ride, I'm ready to ride
No fear over here, we ready to ride
We ready to ride, we ready to ride
