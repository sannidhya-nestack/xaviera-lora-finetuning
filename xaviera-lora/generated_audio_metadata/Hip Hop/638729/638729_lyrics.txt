B swag I'm cutting up, Louis V's on my button up
I hit the club they walking up, they see the team they know it sucks
Live beyond the clouds, in the club with loud
Don't a move the crowd, shorty in the brown
You ask to dance, I grab her hand, then grab a girl, you tell a man
You should know I don't give a damn, friends and fans are like pots and pans
She feelin' that Henny, her friend lookin' friendly and finny, she feelin' my (attitude)
If I spend a penny, these bitties will show me they z-dicks, man, that's what they (had to)
Your man feelin' gritty, your pity get killed in my city, man, that's what you (had to)
I'm 50 in 50 when snipin' a fool with my 50 and that's my (favorite dude)
I'm tellin' me, drama porn, presidential Obama on that fetty
I'm ready to get it and move like Andretti so tell me when's (don't call me)
This Mercy cool but that God he fast
Shorty cool but that's just how it act
Blow a pack you can pass me that
Blow my bag don't ask me that
I'm all about grind I'm fine I'm taking my fine
You fools just wanna be mad
I'm making a man I'm glad
I'm loving them sad wait till I show them the bag
Show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, throw a couple dollars in
Throw a couple dollars in
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag
Show me the bag, throw a couple dollars in
Throw a couple dollars in
You know my name, my game's the same
Take it to a try, can't take my flame
I don't know why they wanna stop my fame
From rocks and rain to stocks and things
Got lil bread that bought me blame
Got lil head that brought out brain
Everywhere that show the show
Consta to Consta
Why she do it I don't know, she say for drugs she blow for blow
Not the first person that I know, Bobby Brown he blow on blow
No nigga I know flow on blow, but all niggas I know flow on dro
That crazy life, live yours right, profound got models buying bottles of Sprite
Of course that purple, past that course, A's like Urkel
Call me a dork I take that hit, this shit dime I take that shit
Ran my grind, I take that brick
Roll H-Tel time, I take that shit (ish)
That beam is fine, parked on my grind
A series 9, I take that whip, break that shit (ish)
I'm ready to get it, my nigga they comin' up with it
Like Eps, I got the juice, ready to hit it
I'm Remy and Rose, more wetter than drinkin' gin and juice
My new whip is kitted, my fitted and wrist is spaghetted
I'm fittin' like dollars, dude
I do what I said in my bag, it's still full of that fatty
I'm all about cheddar, dude
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in
