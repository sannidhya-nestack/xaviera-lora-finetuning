I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you, I'll do it for you
As I ascend through this final dimension
I feel like it's my duty to mention
A dark cloud looming over the city
As the dancing police, they gather in committee
Erasing demands and squashing the plans
Of our youth in the form of a truth
It's a game that they play between classes and races
Numbers and faces and tribes and cases
It's an urban oasis meant to feed our minds
With the good stuff in life
It's so hard to find
We gotta be tough
With leaders oppressed from the top to the bottom
It's a big ole mess
So how do we fight it?
What do we do?
It's too fuckin' hard, yeah, I feel you
Trust in your passion and speak with no sound
A vital part of the underground
Send the invitations out to all my shiny friends
Let's get this party started quick before it ends
Join the celebration, let's call this occasion
Funky intersexual groove all collaboration
Let the story unfold and the truth be told
To the people that give a fuck and not be sold
Forces plotting their courses to erase anything halfway cool
Hiding their horses, the fourth have got nothing fucking better to do
Than to bring down the funk, I ask you
How we gonna take it to a higher level
When you're making us out to be the devil
(Woo!) Fuck you!
Ravers and freaks speak in their minds as they dance in the streets
Another generation of funky ass youth making noise cause they wanna they heard true
Embrace this crewology culture and play
I say to the man with nothing to say
He speaks to me in electronic sound or by the heart of the underground
Send invitations out to all my shiny friends (all my shiny friends)
Let's get this party started
Party started quick before it ends
Join the celebration
Let's call this occasion
Monkey Intersection will prove all collaboration
Reaction
Smoke out, talk out, have a better day
Legalizing weeds and the trees today
What they say is wrong, you're right
Controversial media keeps you up at night
Thinking about details you lack, what?
Success from your mind is what you can pluck
Let's come together, do it naturally
Turn up the sound in the underground
Send the invitations out to all my shiny friends
Let's get this party started quick before it ends
Join the celebration, let's call this occasion
Funky intersection, we're here for all collaboration
Send the invitations out to all my shiny friends
Let's get this party started quick before it ends
Join the celebration, let's call this occasion
Funky intersection with a group of our collaboration
Send the invitations out to all my shiny friends
Let's get this party started quick before it ends
Join the celebration, let's call this occasion
Funky intersectional groove of collaboration
