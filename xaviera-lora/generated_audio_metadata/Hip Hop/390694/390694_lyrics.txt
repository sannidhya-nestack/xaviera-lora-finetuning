I would die for you, like I would for you, like I would for you, like i would for you, like i would for you, like i would for you, like i would for you
Tell my unborn kids ive, please understand me where I'm coming from
All I've done, succumb to rise and set like the sun
My history of misery, ain't need no sympathy
Bitch on me vividly with the way that things is going, ain't no stopping me
Bitch on my prophecy and pain, through all the rain
If I could change, put'em in the game, in the fast lane
Suicidal as if my last days, cash pays
Know that living life at a fast rate
Said to myself some say on the runway, a runway
Sixteen on the streets, intrigued with gunplay
Ain't no love for ghetto bastards
Drastic tactics I casted
Though I blasted catastrophes
Tryna survive in the struggle
My main thing
But pain brings nothing but trouble
How many ways to ride
How many ways to rise
Initialize the specs of life
And keep your eyes on the prize
Would you ride for me
Like I'd ride for you
Would you die for me
Like I'd die for you
Lost soul at the crossroads
Eternally yours
Without a doubt about it
Place my life for yours
Would you die for me
Like I'd die for you
Would you die for me, like I would for you?
Seeing visions of getting buried, worried my last breath
Stressed with constant threat, always puffing up also madness
An early grave, a dirty game, still it's a shame
Eternal flames, in box my heart with only pain
Whatever it takes to shook shake and break
Let loon lost and crazed, laced embrace my faith
Walls hard, cross falls, secrets in the dark
Against the wall and all odds catch me if I fall, tears for pain
No fears, no peace, motherfuck the police
Unleashed and never ceased
Deleted, more grief and no peace
Fresh out the cage, locked up and locked down
Under pressure, drastic measures, so what now?
Proceed with extreme caution
Cautious, never giving a shit, ever giving a fuck
How many ways to rise? How many ways to ride?
Initialize the specs of life and keep your eyes on the prize
Would you ride for me like I'd ride for you?
Would you die for me like I'd die for you?
Lost soul at the crossroads eternally yours
Without a doubt about it place my life for yours
Would you die for me like I died for you?
Would you die for me sure I'd do it for you?
Would you die for me, like I'd die for you
Would you die for me, like I would for you
Would you ride for me, like I'd ride for you
Would you die for me, like I'd die for you
Lost soul at the crossroads, eternally yours
Without a doubt about it, place my life for yours
Would you die for me, like I'd die for you
Would you die for me? Surely I'd do it for you
Would you die for me? Would you die, would you die, would you die? Like I'd die for you?
Would you die for me? Like I would for you?
Or would you die, would you die, would you die for me? (Would you die for me?) (Would you die for me?) (Would you make me happy?) (Would you die?) (Like I would for you) (Would you, would you, would you?) (For me?)
Oh, dear
