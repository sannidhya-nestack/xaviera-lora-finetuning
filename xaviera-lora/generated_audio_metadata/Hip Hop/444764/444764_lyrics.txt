Yeah, uh-huh, whoo, it's Purple Chrome, y'all
Now I don't care how many times you tried to deny
Your core feelings of love for me inside
All I know is that my flame is burning blue for you
Like a white relighting purple candle
I'm not gonna change for you girl this is me
Doing this music's probably the reason why you love me
I think I'm so inclined to believe it's true
But yo not tryna be a cocky fool but yo
I think it's kinda dope though, how we connected on this music in the studio
Looking at you staring deep into your brown eyes
You're beautiful girl, one of a kind when I
Had realized the stars in the sky had nothing
I was immersed in your eyes and baby
What I profess is true
Just as real as the first night I slept with you
See I want you
Like right now tonight
I need you
My darkness needs light
See girl we fit
Yet we're opposites
You're still the yang to my ying and that's it
I want you
Like right now tonight
I need you
My darkness needs light
See girl we fit, yet we're opposites
You're still the yang to my ying and that's it
See you're my heart girl
And there's no other woman who'll take your place
Cause what I felt when I met you
Was real serious, so serious
The kinda love to make me straight delirious
You had me open like a flower on a sunny day
You got me feeling like I need you girl in every way
I keep it real and I don't care what nobody say
So screw them and fuck me if you get away
I need your ears girl
I need to know that you hear me when I'm saying
When I talk as my heart speaks
Baby I'm filling buckets as it leaks
Taking chances letting you know what you're worth to me
So listen I don't wanna say this twice
I love you girl and this is my life
My soul, my heart, my strife
I breathe you, sometimes more than life
I want you, like right now, tonight
I need you, my darkness needs light
See girl we fit, yet we're opposites
You're still the yang to my ying and that's it
I want you, like right now, tonight
I need you, my darkness needs light
See girl we fit, like opposites
You're still the yang to my ying and that's it
See this is urgent, you got me feeling like the prince of Persia
On a mission girl I'm coming for you
Navigating the waters of what you say
Appreciating in value like real estate
Don't make me wait another minute girl I miss you
Don't make me wait another minute girl to kiss you
Don't make me wait another hour just to hold you
Don't make a pass on these feelings that you hurt
Don't make a pass girl don't let my love burn
Don't be afraid to say three little words
Don't make me wait another minute girl I miss you
Don't make me wait another minute girl to kiss you
Don't make me wait another hour just to
Hold you, hold you
Don't make a pass on these feelings that you hurt
Don't make a pass girl don't let my love burn
Don't be afraid to say three little words
