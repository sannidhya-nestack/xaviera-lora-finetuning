It's the S-H-I to the F-T-S-L-A-T-E
It's the limited edition nigga fuck you pay me
In my country crew drinking on Bellevue and Grey Goose
Having hicks feeling my pain left bleeding they boots I speak the truth
Shoot'em the master to the scratch
This hill couldn't be me
For sure it was chopped and had
You think I don't know you'd be out there shaking your ass
Tryna knock the folks up them lyrics just straight trash
And for me, rather stay on point like a javelin
Hope they fat the weapons can get when the rats batter them, shatter them
We kill a Bogart and it's strictly for amateur
Best come clean like Ja Rule for a damager
Lyric equipped with the clip
On the hip, even brain tissues rip
Grab the cleats, I need a grip
See I'm so out my head right now
Trapped in the sounds
You hate this shit, be mentin'
Whispers in the background
You get so ed plays, my time to shine
Double A-9, now I ain't even gettin' to strike prime, nigga
You killin' me, I'm a fuckin' veteran
Shoot that rifle next to Big and Pac
Check my letter on
I guess right to the chase, no cuttin' corners
I'ma shoot work up all like Mona
Not just some donors
In this rap game, Lil One hit wonders
Don't want none, I'm hit like God when I unleash my thunders
I'm from the dirty district, all them dog pimps in masks
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shorty's in the front, all my niggas in the back, throw'em up (hey, hey, hey, DC, where you at?)
I'm from the dirty district, all them dog pimps in masks (yeah)
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks (yeah)
Now my shorty's in the front, all my niggas in the back, throw'em up (coming through again)
My rap attacks ain't nothin'til back in your sack, black
Don't make me ski-ski all over these tracks, splat
That's how I'm rollin', gangsta strollin'
Cash prep for the fold, now be that shifty bitch that's holdin'
Still, givin' love to the fans while keepin' it gutter
Steppin' on their head and real hatin'
Motherfuckers just been faced with that platinum, baby
Past friends, it come to real, these niggas greener than Fugazi
They paid me, dudes, they've shifted the frame
Constipation got'em all on the strain, held in a clutch by the brain
Keep it the same, nigga
What can I say, shit my shit be after maps
Ain't like Eminem and Dr. Dre
My rap's phenomenon, they straight feelin'em
Pullin' the flesh off they backs, die hard fans, I'm killin'em
Some of you gon' respect the art, if I rip your souls apart
Leave an open leakage in your hearts
Y'all can't deny, iven destinies and blessed microphones
Set the stage, see they minds blown, then I'm gone
Back there, they the only place I'm droppin' bombs
Lean in my park, my cars national, fully armed
Take to the streets, rockin' the urban way from Rock to Sean John
I keep it gangsta, y'all know fuck a nigga
My enemies on any MC
Don't smoke up your asses B
Shit I took the type of fight that never go without feeling me
I'm from the dirty district
All them dog pimps and maxxers
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shorty's in the front
All my niggas in the back
Throw'em up, mixy where you at?
I'm from the dirty district
All them dog pimps and maxxers
24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shorty's in the front
All my niggas in the back
Throw'em up
Coming through again
This the type of hit to get you croaked up in the club
Y'all gotta fuck and know J shorty that's wassup
My dawgs getting they life, wilding for the night
Ain't trick, want jump site (we bust your motherfucking head) ride
I stay soft and rock it don't play with me man
That ass is shaped quicker than puffin bad boy the band
My Ruka stands with the shift he named to existence
Persistent, yelling, willing to go the distance
So for real, ain't the one to be fucked with, dawg
The geek ain't got your number, dick ain't no balls
Dial him 1-800, bitch, make nigga wanna call
Just rhyme to no action, I forever stand on top of y'all
Just let it be, let the truth speak
Looking spoken for
Lean without a paddle up Schitt's Creek
Welcome to my world, I'm the life preserver
Stuff these imbeciles for taking that step further
Get your token green, got some poppin' y'all brooders
Turn their ass out like nudist, forever remainin' useless
We makin' moves, quote, "hip-hop venues"
Home of the guggo, pad them stats on the menu I can't lose
Besides your whole style's a gimmick, you're worthless
I'm like lava on the drip, diggin' holes in the earth's surface
But stand on top of the games, only way truly livin' out my life perfectly
All them dog pimps in masks, 24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shorty's in the front, all my niggas in the back
Throwing my man noise so I can see you act
A revolutionary district, all them dog pimps in masks, 24 spinner slims sitting on stacks
Now my shorty's in the front, all my niggas in the back
Coming through a gat, DC, I'm right here, I'm right there, I'm really near
KRS, no fear, I'm always in the back and I'm always in the front
KRS don't front, make the whole party jump
