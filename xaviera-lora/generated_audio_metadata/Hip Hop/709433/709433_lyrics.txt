Shout out, Neil deGrasse Tyson
We're underground, but we live our life
Like Pluto's the place to go
No matter who or where you're from
The place where the winds and the waters of our God are sung
Past rings of Saturn, for the right time matter
Constellation patterns that make up Adam matter
Adam as it faster than light aperture
You can shatter sound, gravity and ground
That's how we hold it down, we live and breathe it now
Seed in the garden, it blossom all around
Like from underground, every town's strong
Every single article, particle of molecule, particle of domino
We all fall and drop in groups, water moves a lot of feet, we're all living proof
Small fish in a big pond or Olympic sized pool
Leave a carbon print, giant size to the moon
Hydrogen combined, designed for a new course
Steam turbine, few pipe lines in your hood
Can't hide why we drive by blue fuel fumes
Those reactors can't cool Fukushima boom
We're underground but we live our life
Black Pluto is the place to shout about
No matter who or where you're from
We're the ones, we're the ones who will act on you
Next level, new planet, do damage
Shoot to the moon just to get a better view
Black Pluto, act like you know
Get chopped in the throat by Zab Judah
Brutal weather condition insistent
Hotlines mixing dicks in middle of a summertime
Drought, wonder why the run's out
Snake bliss can I pop it?
No pot to piss and all vod, no livin'
Rock to the rhythm all forth and back
Whipe y'all for the clones like it's orphan black
I'm forced to laugh, I'm across the map
No matter where you're at you can see the cracks
So please relax, it's a matter of time
Generate and skip in a catacomb mind
Telephoto zoom on a polar moon
Weak shoot for the sky, whoop, be home soon (soon soon soon soon soon)
Be home soon (soon soon soon soon soon soon soon soon soon soon soon)
Black Pluto
Human consumers confusing maneuver
Remove the universe as soon as you and I
The two of us, rumors of who did worse, it's do or die
We did work chopping on them trees
So easy carbon copy with efficiency
Evil geniuses, so much evil off their sleeves
The reason that we left was the ego in between
How did we get here to black atmosphere
Lacks all the methane, acid rain and alcohol
The fall of men stood tall, we bend
Don't break jokes to next and broke great links
So deep breath, breathe what's left
There's no right from wrong when
I'ma get off, it's the end of days, not the end of time
Blank dean come by, blind eyes because sunshine
A new chapter, capture the last gas
Two manufactured, new gas masks
The earth was flat when the crust combust
The last won't be first and the rest shall corrupt to dust
We're underground but we live our lives Black Pluto is the place we shout about
No matter who or where you're from We're the ones, we're the ones who light up the sun
We're the ones who blacked out the sun
We blacked out, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're the ones who blacked out the sun, sun, blacked out the sun, blacked out the sun, sun, sun, blacked out the sun, sun, blacked out the sun, sun, blacked out the sun (we're the ones who blacked out the sun, we're the ones who blacked out the sun, blacked out the sun, sun, blacked out the sun, black out the sun, blacked out the sun, blacked out the sun, blacked out the sun, black out the sun, blacked out the sun, blacked
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
We're all connected to each other, biologically
To the earth, chemically
And to the rest of the universe, atomically
That's kinda cool
That makes me smile
And I actually feel quite large
It's not that we are better than the universe, we're part of the universe.
