Yeah, alright
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Yeah
Damn it 6 in the morning
We having good conversation
And didn't even notice the time
But that doesn't even matter
Ain't talked like that in a while
I'm glad that you hit me on facebook
Now we can keep in touch
Leave your post on my wall
Now you got my number you can call
See I never thought that
I'd ever see you again
You still look incredible girl
See I loved my life living single
But baby girl you threw me off
It's something about that talk
Now you really got me high on you
On you
On you
You really got me high on you
On you
On you girl
Got me high on you
On you, on you, you really got me high
On you, you really got me high
On you, girl (you got me high)
Oh yeah I thought about it
About hitting you up
But I never did
Cause I knew I'd be back in love
So I let it pass
Pass right through my mind
But now I'm seeing
That I was wasting my time with those other girls
Where were you girl
When I needed
When I needed someone to laugh at my corny jokes
Ooh you just don't know
I just wanna roll you up
Cause you really got me high on you
On you
On you
You really got me high on you
On you
On you girl
Got me high on you
On you, on you, on you
You really got me high on you
You really got me high on you, girl
Listen, you see things have changed since we last talked
I'm down the V .A. trying to leave the past blocked
I'm meeting different women, different coaches that had to stop
I lost who I was, had to find my right spot
I swore off women for a minute to get right
To get me together, get me to be alright
I had to let go, but I had to grow up
It's like I'm waiting on a new me to show up
And then you came back, back with a vengeance
All of these years, we always kept friendships
Same sense of humor, how could it be this?
You got me feeling this way, you a phoenix
The way you brought back old feelings, it's crazy
A fresh new perspective on love, it changed me
Don't worry baby girl, ain't expecting a reply
But after we talked the other night
Now you really got me high on you, on you, on you
You really got me high on you, on you, on you girl
Got me high on you
On you, on you, on you
You really got me high on you
You really got me high on you girl (You got me high on you)
Yeah, alright
Now you really got me high on you
