Uh-huh
I'ma tell you what I like
It be them girls that be'bout 5'5" with thick thighs
Brown skin, lime green eyes
Rude as fuck
Ain't always pressin' the look
But that's alright though
Mami can slide the night though
I pulled her to the side
Then asked her if she wanted to ride up on the Magic Carpet
We take a flight to Arabian Heights
We doin' things that your man ain't gon' like
So get your mind right
And let your conscience be free
And don't worry about nothin'
Cause it's all on me
Step inside the pyramid
We can handle some bids
I wanna spread them legs
Why girl you gon' hide it
All I wanna do is get a fix of your love
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I really need is a fix
A kiss from your lips
And all I really need is a fix
Your style, your profile, ain't nothing like the other chicks
Cleopatra was her name
An uptown girl with a down south friend
A freaky little style she could call her own
And a snarky little smile sitting on the throne
She's the queen of denial
You know I'm liking your style, your whole profile
And I've been waiting for a chance
So come a little closer and let's dance
All I wanna do is get a fix
So you love, I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I really need is a fix, a kiss from your lips
Got my head playing tricks, all I wanna do is get a fix
So you love, you do it like nobody does
And all I really need is a fix, your style and profile
Ain't nothing like the other chicks
All I wanna do is get a fix for your love
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I wanna do is give and take and sleep in love
That's what I made of
Dog this ya man, hear that style
Pay it for the ladies also
Gentama, Kunda, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland
Stop dis ya man, hear dem stance
I hear father layin' ass up
Gentleman come down, you ask how long we are on island
You got me feeling for real, your mind sharp as a knife
And in the morning Mia you could probably start a new life
Willing to gamble cause you just can't lose
You gotta choose baby girl don't get it confused
Just close your eyes we in the city of love
And if you wanna get high then mommy roll up your body
You know we got plenty, Alizea Henny
Doing the buck fifty in a cherry red Bentley
We swirl up on the two and three
Get a fix of your love
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I really need is a fix
A kiss from your lips got my head playing tricks
All I wanna do is get a fix of your love
All I really need is a fix
Your style, your profile, ain't nothing like them other chicks
All I wanna do is get a fix, so you'll love
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I really need is a fix
A kiss from your lips, got my head playing tricks
All I wanna do is get a fix, so you'll love
You do it like nobody does
And all I really need is a fix
Your style, your profile, ain't nothing like them other chicks
Get a fix of your love
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
All I really need is a fix
A kiss from your lips got my head playing tricks
All I wanna do is get a fix of your love
You do it like nobody does
And all I really need is a fix
