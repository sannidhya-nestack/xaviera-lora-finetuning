I can't believe I made it (I can't believe I made it)
I can't believe I'm here (Can't believe I'm here)
The options of course are put through
I know nothing but me to lose
The love back to me and my crew
I live the life as we do
Reminiscing on hard times that shaped us to something brand new
Prayin' that every day life will stay in its ways
Everyone talked about how life was rough
To be honest I guess our struggles weren't too much
We were raised to think never enough
Mom and dad kept all our bellies stuffed
Had a tough childhood in the Chicago suburbs
Still nothing compared to what my momma suffered
On the south side London town girls were found
On a regular basis dirty cops try and twee race
Footprints that would lead right back to crooked operations
Costing lives of underage gangsters
Mainstream media never cover crime but the sun don't shine
Guess they figure our people won't mind
Ding ding Johnny tell him what he want too late got popped off now the game is done
Moment of silence for a mother's son
While violence and praise not shine in the opposite direction
At least turn out for your elections
Then in the next address you could be a leader's constituents
Someone's taking after you and your crew
Tax dollars help you get through school with the right tools
The right rules and plans will ignite you
Find a group of friends that really like you
Blood sucking women just chicks out to bite you
Reminisce on the good times
Cause as you grow older you realize all the fun's being averaged
Goodbye real talk uh
I can't believe I'm
I have it all, I can't believe I'm here
The options of course, I'm put through one, it's nothing but me to lose it
No flexing me and my crew, I live the life as we do
Reminiscin' on hard times that shaped us to something brand new
Prayin' that everyday life would stay in it's way
Have yet to et'bout the time when a classmate took what was mine
Came home cryin' and screamin' over somethin' worth a dime
Didn't want to but mom went and told the principal
Said the object's irrelevant, this is all about the principal
Take what doesn't belong to you and suffer discipline
Imagine the good guy winnin','til the next day old boy says that you finished
Decided to stick up for myself
Ripped that young boy like a belt
Spit ignited propane
Competition beat into a pulp like OJ
In the race to the top being chased like OJ
Clean up the crap in the rap game, cold game
Have these lames hypnotize, OBEX
Close when they at the red ole
Get a girl first date, after that keep space
Not trying to get you on the TMZ replay
Cause it's a lot juicier
Publishing stories on what she say
Confrontations with any other third party
Doing my best to eat bait
Cause my crew and I look at all the money that we made
Running an empire
No relay, no Lee Daniels
Though this life too hard
I wasn't training for the stars let's go!
I can't believe I'm here (can't believe I'm here)
The obstacles of course I'll put through
I know nothing but me to lose
The left back's a me and my crew
I live the life as we do
Reminiscing on hard times that shaped us to something brand new
Prayin' that everyday life will stay in it's way
