Show me the bag, show me the bag, show me the bag, show the bag, show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in, show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in
B-Swag I'm cutting up, Louis V's on my button up
I hit the club they walking up, they see the team they know it's us
Live beyond the clouds, in the club with loud
Don't a move the crowd, shorty in the brown
You ask to dance, I grab her hand, then grab a girl, you tell a man
You should know I don't give a damn, friends and fans are like pots and pans
She feelin' that Henny, her friend lookin' friendly and finny, she feelin' my (attitude)
If I spend a penny, these bitties will show me they titties, man, that's what they (had to)
Your man feelin' gritty, your pity get killed in my city, man, that's what you (had to)
I'm 50 in 50 when snipin' a fool with my 50 and that's my (favorite too)
I'm tellin' me, drama porn, presidential Obama on that fetty
I'm ready to get it and move like Andretti so tell me when (so talk)
This mercy cool but that God he fast
Shorty cool but that ass is fat
Blow a pack you can pass me that
Blow my bag don't ask me that
I'm all about grind I'm fine I'm taking my fine
You fools just wanna be mad
I'm making them mad I'm glad
I'm loving them sad
Wait till I show them the bag
Show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, throw a couple dollars in
Throw a couple dollars in
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in
Throw a couple dollars in
You know my name, my game's the same
Niggas still trying, can't take my flame
I don't know why they wanna stop my fame
From rocks and rain to stocks and thangs
Got lil bread that bought me bling
Got lil head that broad I bring
Everywhere that show the show, concert of concert
Why she do it, I don't know
She say for drugs, she blow for blow
Not the first person that I know
Bobby Brown, he blow on blow
No nigga I know flow on blow
But all niggas I know flow on draw
That crazy life, live yours right
Mindfuckin' models buying bottles of Sprite
Of course that purple, pass that course
A's like Urkel, call me a dork, I take that hit
Bitch a dime I'll take that shit
Spray my grind I'll take that brick
Rolex tell time I'll take that shit
That beam is fine parked on my grind
A series 9 I'll take that whip
Break that shit
I'm ready to get it
My niggas they coming up with it
Like Eps I got the juice
Ready they hit it
I'm Remy and Rose more wetter than drinking gin and juice
My new whip is kitted
My fitted and wrist is spaghetted
I'm fitting like dollars dude
I do what I said in my bag
It's still full of that fatty
I'm all about cheddar dude
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Show me the bag, show me the bag
Throw a couple dollars in, throw a couple dollars in
