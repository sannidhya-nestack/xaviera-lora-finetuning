Livin life to the fullest, representin straight up 9 0 0 1 9
Eyes on the prize, from sunset to sunrise
Out from Long Beach, Compton, San Fernando and Watts
Numbed by the heart beat away from death, yes oh yes
Stress, pressure and pain still don't matter get caught up in the game
Fame reign no doubt to the fact we all the same
True blue dime mood black love and brown pride
For the east to the west worldwide no doubt to the fact it's time to rise
Better reckon up better rise so free between heaven and hell
So don't try to push me simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
For the way it is better watch your back
Better watch your stack
Simply for the very fact
Who's they don't know how to act
Better though
So better be checking us out before yourself be getting checked
Cause we're to be stepping up on the set
Y'all better be hitting the deck
It's like this
I don't know how the Batiste can attest it
If I'm ever to go I'll make way for seven more castles cause
These type of things happen each and every day ya

In a layer
Simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
Nothing to lose, playing my dues
Not one to be making false moves, choose playing the rules
Temptations got me going out of my mind, Lord knows
Lost soul at the crossroads, eternally yours
Hardcore, rough and rugged
Subject motherfuckers love it
But blind to the facts perhaps
See somebody think that I'm buggin' love and nothing
No doubt thought about it I would ride for you
No second I start when it comes down to it I would die for you
Better reckon nobody rides so free between heaven and hell
So don't try to push me simply for the fact that I'm on the edge
For the way it is better watch your back
Better watch your stack
Simply for the very fact
Fools they don't know how to act
Read it out so better be checkin' yourself before yourself be gettin' checked
