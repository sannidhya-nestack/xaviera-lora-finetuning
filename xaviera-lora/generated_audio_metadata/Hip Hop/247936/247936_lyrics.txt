Strong arm in these hoes my nigga never that
The way I Mack is just too clever
Jack Cena walking up the street
There was no holding back
She had a cute face and that ass was fat
Don't want no strings attached
But I think I met my match
All I can say to myself is damn I hit that
When I approached her didn't make no sudden moves
I don't be running my G's like most of these other fools
I caught her in a good mood we started walking and talking
I ain't trying to rush it proceed with caution
Cause this could be a hit
Bait for the perfect nick but we get to a crib and I see she legit
And I know she's a freak but this girl had me feening
I'm bout to call it a evening I ain't thinking bout leaving
And the sex filled the room while I'm beating she screaming
Woke up with her the next day and still thought I was dreaming
She got a face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
I can't fight it, I can't deny it
I see your booty bouncing, vibrating
I really like it, I get excited
I'm daydreaming about being inside it
And it's looking so fat and juicy
I might even bite it
You wanna ride it
My pony ready for racing
ive me but I'm impatient
I'm ripping your apple bottoms
I'm tryna get you a bottle
Tryna get to the bottom of this bottle
While I'm doing so should not be a problem
It's not a problem if she thick in the middle
I need some cushion for pushing
My guys are already gushing
Them guys are already hating
Off the tracks that I'm making
But all them groupies they love it
They've been supportive and patient
I know you waiting my recipe
Marinating in the oven
I got the cookbook of love out the coven
I got the stuffing
I got the season
I got the flour
Now all I need is a mat and a maroon in an hour
We take a shower, you watching me and I'm watching you
I'm washing you, I'm hypnotized, I'm mesmerized
I'm looking at your face, your eyes, your hips, your thighs
Your tits, your ass, your shape, your body
She got a face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
She got a face like
She got thighs like
She got ass like
She got a body like
Woah, this girl was the complexion, the Hennessy with a coke bottle shape, you know that's a good recipe
Plus I like how she was put together, she had an hourglass figure, this the perfect time to go and get her
As sweet as Amaretto, where the body make you sweat it, cause she hotter than a nigga in the summer wearing leather
No better yet she's hotter than a pepper, she thicker than a four page letter
So now I'm trying to read her, well we can meet each other in the middle
I take you on the wild side, you can slow me down a little
We from different lifestyles but opposites attract
So slide in my lack and I can show you where it's at
She got a face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
She got a face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like whoa
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah woah
Face like ooh, thighs like oh
Ass like damn with a body like woah woah
