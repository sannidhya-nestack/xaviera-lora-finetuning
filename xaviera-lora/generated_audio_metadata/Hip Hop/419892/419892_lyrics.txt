Who is here? Who is here? Who is here? Who is here?
It's all around us, everyone thinking about nothing but self
Driving down the street like crazy fools
Can't see nobody else
What you gonna do when the game is through
You gonna have to choose
If you snooze you lose
Sleeping at night it's a scary sight
Can't feel alright when you're so uptight
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Just get off to beat your groove too
Put on some brand new shoes
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Get on back to the school of life
The school of life
If you wanna ask me just what I see
And how my mind became so free
I tell you this, my daddy used this, this
With me so hard you know I never ot
You can be right and still lose a fight
But I'm still strong, I keep holding on
I thank God for my mother who believed in me
When there was no other
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Just get off the beat you groove too
Put on some brand new shoes
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Get on back to the school of life
The school of life
Slow it down
That's all it is, simple
Just slow it down fool, slow it down
If you wanna ask me just what I see
And how my mind became so free
I tell you this, my daddy used his fists
He whipped me so hard you know I never fucked it
You can be right and still lose a fight
But I'm still strong, I keep holding on
I thank God for my mother who believed in me
When there was no other
You don't have to be so one
Just get off the beach and groove to
Put on some brand new shoes
You don't have to be so one
Get on back to the school of life (the school of life)
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Get off the beat you groove to
Put on some brand new shoes
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Get on back to the school of life (the school of life)
Of life, wildlife
The school of life
You don't have to be so one
(Magnanimous)
Get off the beat, you're grooved too
Put on some brand new shoes
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
Get on back to the school of life
The school of life
You don't have to be so one (magnanimous)
The school of life
Love love love life life life
Love, love, love life, life
