(audience chattering)
Yeah I know, comes out my mouth's hot
And save him in my outbox
Technology's sick, innovating
Nowadays it ain't wasting
I push my four buttons
Idea when I turn it into something
Sick, really quick
Trevor you are making the lick
Well Roxanne I'm reckless
So can I go to leave you breathless
My rhymes sound like the bling on a necklace
So I said to respect this
Cause you can never ever reject this
I got more flows than flavours in this quick
And when I find out who took my phone
You get thrown in the exit
'Cause I'm the kinda girl that you don't wanna mess with
You say you can't flow well let's test it
Testing, testing while I'm so strong
Yeah it's because I've been in class for so long
And everything that would or could have has gone wrong
So now I'll uncle it as life can only move on, on
et your chit chat I'ma make it
And there's nothing you can do that can shatter nor break it
I've got the power inside of me to get all your negativity
So now I'm back on solid ground
Think I got this
So now I'm back on solid ground
Right now it's time to lose control
Come on
Come on
Phone full of lyrics and now I think I got this
On my way to the studio then I lost it
Damn what am I gonna do it's like oh my gosh my career is through
Whoever finds my cell is gonna be a lucky man so
Next time I'ma make a back up plan
So I don't end up in the same situation
Cause disappointment now is what I'm facing
It's the return of the best say my name is Roxanne
More bounce in my flow than shots man
Compare me to the rest of y'all ox man
Cause I'm mag sick contagious like pox man
I'm like a lux man opening doors
I'm elevating to the top floors
I work hard like a slave doing chores
Speaking my mind on the beat no laws
I'm the master
You're quick but I move much faster
My tracks penetrate walls like Kasbah
And through the paint and through the wall through the plaster
Enough to rent it like a natural disaster
Peace and love like a dreadlocked rasta
I don't do pop but I got the east factor
I repeat I'm the master
Just the intro wait for the next batter
So now I'm back on sunny ground
Back again
Feel good
Happy day
So now I'm back on sunny ground
Happy day
So happy day
So now I'm back on sunny ground
So now I'm back on sonic ground (ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground)
So now I'm back on sonic ground (ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground, ground)
