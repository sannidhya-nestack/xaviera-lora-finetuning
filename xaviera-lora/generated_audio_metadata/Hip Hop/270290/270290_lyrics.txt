I just wanna get to the door man, ayy, alright man, I'ma tell you like this dog
Aye, right now I'm just a nigga on the grind
I'm the grind, tryna shine, gotta grind
They get mine, I got flows by the pound
But it seemin' like they blind
And though they never stop, it don't get seemin' like they tryin'
Aye, but right now I'm just a nigga on the grind
I'm the grind, tryna shine, gotta grind
They get mine, I got flows by the pound
But it seeming like it's blind (yeah)
And though they never stop me dawg it seeming like it's grind (Sean King)
Aye, it's like they see me on the grind so they hurry to block
They never wanna see me shine but I urge them to stop
Cause I'ma reach the top anyway
Any day you can say that I ain't got around
Cause I can make my paper plenty ways
In the days when I grab the mic I'ma renegade (renegade)
Better get it back, I can speak for days
Peers amazed cause they never knew I could flow
My rhymes will take me places that I never knew I would go
It's like a check to paper and I ain't from NYC
Not the CEO but no need to see ID
Cause I don't do the club thing, nah dog you can have it
Everybody jumping round throwing bows like Randy Savage ain't for me
But you do what you do and I'll do what I do
And if this track don't get me signed then I'm back for try 2
And everybody rapping now so maybe you should try too
Nevermind it'll take a million cats to do what I do
To do what I do, dawg to flow like I flow
Ain't this hell tryna make that paper, trust me I know
Never sell, gotta make that safer paper, you know
Cause the jail ain't the safest or the place of the go
The places we go, dawg the people we see
Steady hating dawg, that really sparks the evil in me
I hate Satan but it's kinda like the demons in me
Nevermind guess they all asleep in dreams
Right now I'm just a nigga on the grind, I'm the ground trying to shine, gotta grind and get mine
I got flows by the pound but it seeming like they blind
And though they never stop me though it seeming like they trying, ayy
But right now I'm just a nigga on the grind, on the ground trying to shine, gotta grind and get mine
I got flows by the pound but it seeming like they blind
And though they never stop me though it seeming like they trying, ayy
Superb words I ship, I got the gift to lift the masses
Roof the microphone tight enough until it smashes
Y'all niggas flunk the classes, squirming through the trashes
My lyrics leave your mind drunk, causing rap crashes
Outro to intro, blazing instrumentals
I use my thoughts as a utensil, like a pencil
Words walking infernal, external verbal a journal
Jumping over wack niggas like hurdles, grabbing on gerbils
I know these niggas scheming and plotting
But I'm known to leave them bleeding and rotting
Haters dreaming of stopping
Poetic geniuses, the king in myself
Y'all niggas homeless so y'all keep to yourself
My flow's hot so it's able to melt
Whippin' wankers like they mamas with belts
Haters hatin'cause careers on the shelf
Elimination of your whole generation
I've been patiently waitin' to end our relation with no hesitation
Impatiently waitin' like patience but we losin' our patience
Let's face it you facin' the best of the dudes that's replace us in our absence
Cat spinnin' bent hope I have rent
But I seen so much change in life, I gotta have sense
But it ain't about the money or the cream
The chinchilla or the squirrilla, dog, it's all about the dream
It's like the thriller in Manila'cause we boxin' in the ring
A jungle and we lyin', so you rumblin' with kings, bitches
Right now I'm just a nigga on the grind
Underground tryna shine, gotta grind and get mine
I got flows by the pound, but it seemin' like they blind
And though they never stop, it don't get seemin' like they tryin', ay
But right now I'm just a nigga on the grind
Underground tryna shine, gotta grind and get mine
I got a grind, they get mine, I got flows by the pound
But it seemin' like they blind, they know they never stop me dog, it seemin' like they tryin'
We pronounce these lyrics to denounce these haters
Beyond me, there is no other greater
It's the boy Sean King and the good, you can call us the saviors
This is the dedication, R .I .P. to Gator
