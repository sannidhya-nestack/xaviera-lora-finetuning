Oh baby, yeah, oh baby, oh, oh, oh baby, oh baby
Early, diva chillin' with my girlies
Put on in the bay but I'm worldly
Tryna get my attention, he thirsty
Watchin' me suck my straw, flirty
My sheets are clean but I'm undercover dirty
Gotta prove to a diva that you're worthy
Gotta prove to a diva you deserve me
But prove it over there, don't urge me
It's all good baby, take your time (As long as you ain't wasting mine)
As long as you ain't wasting mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oops, then again, I change my mind (It's not my fault)
It's not my fault, blame my sign (I'm crazy)
Going crazy, I need to hire a shrink
Sitting at my table, I quietly think (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why do men give a arm and a leg (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you bark in your bed just to buy me a drink? (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's thirsty (It's hot in here, but my presence makes it hotter)
You thirsty now you need a lot of water cause you thirsty
We just met and now he wants me to have his daughter
He thirsty so thirsty so thirsty thirsty
And he be like can I can we why can't I why can't we
And he be like can I can we why can I why can't we
He thirsty you wanna stand around me but you can't
Don't talk me boy don't wanna listen to you rant
What's growing on your mind
I can't hear you pant
Been drinking now you're thinking with your pants
Typical
Man and if I give you one chance
Imma break out if you make up a dumb dance
He wanna French kiss he ain't from France
And I ain't a hypnotist but I got him in some trance
They staring at me with heads at a slam
Not only do they say my name they chant chant chant
I'm the queen and you ain't nothing but an ant
My world is a forest and yours is a plant
When you see me backstage, better act your age
I'm a diva, I don't wanna have to smack your face
I go on at about twelve thirty
Damn, these male groupies be acting hella thirsty
It's hot in here, but my presence makes it hotter
You thirsty, now you need a lot of water
you thirsty, we just met
And now he wants me to have his daughter
He thirsty, so thirsty, so thirsty
Thirsty, definition
Dehydrated, parched, you dry baby
What else? Yearning, craving, horny, lusty, desperate
Ain't getting laid, sexless
Masturbation, frustration, constantly
You must hate it, it leads to him talking me up
What happens? Get stalked in the club
I pull his card, it's declined
Gotta be stupid but is he blind?
My body so juicy like a slurpee
I'm a wet wet chick, I got your thirsty
My body so juicy like a slurpee
I'm a wet wet chick, I got your thirsty
It's hot in here but my presence makes it hotter
You thirsty, now you need a lot of water
you thirsty, we just met
And now he wants me to have his daughter
He thirsty, so thirsty, so thirsty, thirsty
Can I, can we, why can't I, why can't we
Can I, can we, why can't I why can't we
Thirsty
Open him up, open him up, open him up, open him up
