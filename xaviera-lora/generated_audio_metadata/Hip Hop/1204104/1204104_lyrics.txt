I'm feeling exposed like a fish out of water
My heart's on display like a lamb to the slaughter
I'm feeling exposed like a book with no cover
My heart's in a cage like a tiger in a stutter
I'm exposed to the world like a flower in the sun
My thoughts are stabbing like a bullet from a gun
I'm feeling exposed like a book with no cover
My soul's on display like a painting by a lover
I have to be strong
My only thing is love
My only thing is love
My only thing is love
I'm feeling exposed
I'm feeling exposed
I'm feeling exposed
I'm feeling exposed
I'm feeling exposed
I'm feeling exposed
My baby, stop
