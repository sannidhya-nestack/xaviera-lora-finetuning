It's broken, it's broken
How you doing? I think my life is broke again
It's probably my fault
I try to force my way
It doesn't matter now
I gotta move on
And stop wasting time
Singing that two-song song
All I hear is constant complaining
All I feel is fingers in my eyes
And exercise and restraining
All that I can do now is try to be
It's broken, it's broken
The reconstruction is well underway
The hunger settles until the bitter day
I follow protocol and hope that it leads somewhere
anywhere is better than a gasket filled with dead air
All I hear is constant complaining
Oh, I feel his fingers in my eyes
An exercise in restraining
All that I can do now is try to be
It's broken
I can't touch anything right now, but I can make up stars
I can't touch anything unless you help me out
