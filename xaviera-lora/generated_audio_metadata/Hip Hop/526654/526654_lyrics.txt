I dress so fly with my diamonds on green
And that's that not me (not me)

You represent your city hold it down for your team (not me)
For your hood keep them cowards on the beam
After every single sentence ima say the same thing (say the same thing)
And that's that not me

Keep them cowards on the beat
After every single sentence

And that's that 9 mean (9 mean)
I'm the man on microphones
Since I hooked with bell jones
I ain't gotta sell stones
I'm on they iPods, iPhones and ringtones
And your main chick wanna get that ding dong
I jump up in that thing and act a fool like King Kong
They call me Bobby Brain like I'm Mr. He-known
One nip, spit that game and say his name like Mike Jones
In the booth I'm Nate Pond

And my dress be lime green (lime green)
My brand stick hot and my kicks so clean (so clean)
I dress so fly with my diamonds on green
