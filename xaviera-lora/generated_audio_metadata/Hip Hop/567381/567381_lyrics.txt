Haven't I told ya, about a million times that I love ya?
Heaven I give in, you're all of my trust now, I never doubt ya
But you can just walk past me, never greetin' me and I'm supposed to want ya
You may think I'm invisible but I'm not invincible because you hurt me, yeah
And tell me where can we go from here?
And tell me where can we go from here? Yeah
And tell me where can we go from here?
And tell me where can we go from here?
And this is not a game, but maybe if it was, then you would notice
If I was a TV screen, then I'd get more love, then I'd know what to do with
And you enveloped my world when I can't even crack your side, did you do it?
Or maybe we need space to get away and remember what love is
And tell me where can we go from here? (If you have any idea)
And tell me where can we go from here?
And tell me where can we go from here?
And tell me where can we go from here?
I'm getting so tired of being the one who always has to fix things
I'm getting so lonely in your bed with you there but you're always sleeping
Except when you're in the mood you just expect me to all of a sudden (just expect me to)
There's gotta be balance though (you know what that is)
Let me know when you find some (baby, baby)
Can we go from here to here?
Can we go from here to here?
Can we go from here to here?
Can we go from here to here?
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
And tell me where can we go from here? And tell me where can we go from here? Tell me where can we go from here? And tell where can we go from here?
(Huh, huh)
(Huh, huh)
(Huh, huh)
