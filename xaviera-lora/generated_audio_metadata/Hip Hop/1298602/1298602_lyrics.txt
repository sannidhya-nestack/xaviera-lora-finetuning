Yeah, whispers in the alley, secrets tight grip
Street corners got stories, let'em rip
Glimpse of the truth, snake fork tongue urban misspoken
But they remain unsung
Concrete jungle screams, drama always lurks
Facade of riches hides the heavy work
A queen with a crowned reality framed
Struggling through life, her soul inflamed
Black lies whisper late at night
So it's buried deep, out of sight
They wanna see her fall but she grows
In the depths where no one knows
Blacklight
Blacklight
Eyes wide open, she's vigilant, aware
Darkness surrounds, but she doesn't scare
Weaving through chaos, she finds her ground
In the heart of the city, strength's profound
Survivals are games, she plays every day
Dodging the pitfall, finding her way
Voices silent, hidden tears, they cry
But she's rising ever stronger, even sky high
Her cries whisper late at night
True, buried deep, out of sight
They wanna see her fall but she grows
In the depths where no one knows
A black line, a black line
Eyes wide open she's vigilant aware
Darkness surrounds but she doesn't scare
Weaving through chaos she finds her ground
In the heart of the city strength profound
Survival's the game she plays everyday
Dodging the pitfalls finding her way
Voices silent hidden tears they cry
But she's rising ever stronger aiming sky high
Blood cries whisper late at night
Trouble for everything, out of sight
They wanna see her fall but she grows
In the depths where no one knows
Blacklight, blacklight
