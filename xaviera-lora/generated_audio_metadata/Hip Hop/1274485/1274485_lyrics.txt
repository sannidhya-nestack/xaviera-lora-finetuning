I was stuck in a rut like a bad Netflix show
Same old same old nowhere to go
But then you came along like a plot twist
And suddenly my life was in such a mess
Now I'm breaking free from the chains of my past
Love unchained that is gonna last
Unchain your love
Give me your love
Unchain that love
Baby show me what you're made of
I was a hot mess expressed but you're my calm
My partner in crime, my ride or die, my bomb
You're the pizza to my cheese, the mellow to my wine
Together we're a team and our love is so fine
Now I'm breaking free from the chains of my past
Love unchained and it's gonna last
Unchain love, give me your love
Unchain that love, baby show me what you're made of
I was lost in the haze of my own doubts
But you came along and turned my frown upside down
You're the sunshine in my rain, the fire in my soul
With you I know we'll make our own rules and take control
We'll take the road less traveled, the one with the potholes
But with you by my side I know we'll make it whole
We'll laugh, we'll cry, we'll make fun of each other's jokes
And our love will be the real deal, no need to fake it
I'm taking love, give me your love
Unchain that love, baby show me what you're made of
Unchain love, give me your love
Unchain that love, baby show me what you're made of
I was a hot mess express but you're my calm
My partner in crime, my ride or die, my bomb
You're the pizza to my cheese, my myrtle to my wine
Together we're a team and our love is so fine
Unchain love, give me your love
Unchain that love, baby show me what you're made of
Unchain love, give me your love
Unchain that love, baby show me what you're made of
