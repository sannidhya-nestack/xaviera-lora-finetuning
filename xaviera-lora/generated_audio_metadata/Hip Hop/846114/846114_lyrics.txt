I thought I told you (yeah)
I thought I told you (yeah)
I thought I told you (yeah)
Hating on me is just something you don't do, nah
You shouldn't talk'til you walked in my shoes (yeah)
Look in my eyes and get lost in my view
I don't know what you done heard
Running your mouth's absurd (absurd)
And I don't know what you been told
But mama ain't raised no hoe (oh no) yeah
Fuck you can hate
Fuck you can run your mouth forever
Cause you don't know shit bitch
You ain't seen my route to China
So cold
Running around without a sweater
Daddy was a fiend
And mama kept the house together
Times was tough so you could hear it in my voice box
And I was on the streets as soon as my boys knocked
On the door, quarter waters in my drawers
Couldn't afford'em, so I was stealing'em from the corner store
Sort of raw, and at a early age I saw it all
Started to get anointed and avoided the court of law
And I ain't even a preteen yet, the things that
We seen, if you can dream we unseen
Ten new kid on the block but, I ain't a wall bird
Before you can walk or crawl you gotta fall first and stand tall
And don't take no handouts and rearrange your plans
If your plans don't pan out, stand out in the crowd
And that's what I did to'cause you don't know about the shit that I done lived through
That's what shaped me, that's what made me and that's my fake bitch so go ahead and hate me
Thought I told you
Hate on me is just something you don't do
Naw you shouldn't talk till you walked in my shoes
Look in my eyes and get lost in my view
I don't know what you done heard
But running your mouth's absurd
And I don't know what you been told
I ain't raised no hoe, oh no
Shit really where do I start?
All my life been playing my part
I was raised around poverty
Ain't no proper to my talk
My family never had no property
I was brought up on the block
From Greensboro to D .E .T.
I ain't properly got caught in all them issues
Stuck in mayhem breaking every law in the language
Fill mimes up with anguish but I reflect in my location
My community the streets where I learned to be a beast
Cause if you weak you getting treated where I burglarize a beating
I ain't frontin when I'm speaking putting on a fake facade
You faggots think you know me only by your naked eyes
I take your hate and lips and stride
Cause your misery just moves me gives me bliss to see you stewing
Boiling at the top just brewing
You ain't fooling or pulling the curtain
I see you with
You wish I lay up under the surface, you'd probably sit and pray
But I think I kicked my feet up here, bitch, I'm here to stay
Matter fact, I got top bunk, you can lay beneath the pain
I thought I told you
Hatin' on me is just somethin' you don't do
Naw, you shouldn't talk'til you walked in my shoes
Look in my eyes and you're lost in my view
I don't know what you done heard
But running your mouth's absurd (absurd)
And I don't know what you've been told
But my main phrase, "No, no" (oh, no)
I can't be fucked with a trusted, so suck this, I chuck shit
Make a runner up, motherfucker, go and tuck his nuts
I'm so nuts, can't get enough of this rough shit
Smoking blunts in public, can't get over it, tough shit
Thought you had a band, but too bad your singer's soft
Think I played on the guitar'til I wore all my fingers off
Look at me, pushing my little thing along
This ain't just another song, so y'all better sing along
My house was in shambles, pots was just dismantled
Anything and everything when he flew off the handle
My life is taboo, tattoos from head to toe
Scarred for life, growing up just thought I'd let you know
I'm a killer on the track now
Rap till I pass out, shuttin' your trap down
If you got a fat mouth, plus I know
You don't wanna take it down that route
Thought you stupid enough to throw a rock out of a glass house
I thought I told you
Hate no means, just somethin' you don't do
Nah, you shouldn't talk'til you walked in
Look in my eyes and get lost in my view
I don't know what you done heard
But running your mouth's absurd
And I don't know what you been told
But my name ain't raised no more
