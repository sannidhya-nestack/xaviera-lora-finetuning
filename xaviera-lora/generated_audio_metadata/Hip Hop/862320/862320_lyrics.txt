I think
I think I had one too many
I think I had one too many to drink
My eyes are getting real heavy
And I feel like everything's moving slow motion to me
I see you over there looking
Maybe I'm finna come over and we finna leave
Maybe I ain't thinking straight
Maybe
Maybe I'm wasted
I think I had one too many, I'm feeling twisted
I don't know if I trust what I see
My vision is blurry, I'm seeing double
I ain't walking straight, I had too much to drink
Mixing my liquor, feeling these swishers
Fill up my lungs with the finest tequila
Tequila straight at the bottle, I'm Witcher
Don Julio and Patron in my liver
You look like the type who just crave it
Baby you and me, let's skip the conversation
We could change this very location
I could take you back to my place
We ain't gotta start, we ain't gotta wait
Lay you down, hit and play
Through the speakers suffocate
Jay Holiday maybe we can get away
Catch the dinner have a drink
Get another round on me
I think I had one too many
I think I had one too many to drink
My eyes are getting real heavy
And I feel like everything's moving slow motion to me
I see you over there looking
Maybe I'm finna come over and we finna leave
Maybe, maybe I ain't thinkin' straight, straight
Maybe I'm wasted
I think I'm way past way too many
I think I had way too many drinks
I'm slurring my words but I'm feeling so good
I'm thinking about you and me doing every dirty trick in the book yes
I have already undressed you in my head
My fingers caressing your body
Outlining all the beautiful curves
When I run up and down on your body
All off this eye contact
That we just made in two minutes
I'm loving your text and the way that you get it
The business come first and the pleasure come with it
I know you ain't cheap you expensive
From the top shelf you drink to the clothes that you're wearing
Your confidence shows and you show off your best
Everyone knows that you like to impress
Are you feeling what I'm feeling
Is it me or is everyone spinning and spinning
I think we should take a picture
We might not remember tonight I'm not kidding
I think I had one too many
I think I had one too many to drink
My eyes are getting real heavy
And I feel like everything's moving slow motion to me
I see you over there looking
Maybe I'm finna come over and we finna leave
Maybe maybe I ain't think of strike strike
Maybe I'm wasted
I see you sippin' on your drink, lookin' classy but I know you lyin'
I know you freaky underneath, Victoria's Secret, no secret on my end
I see you like your martini shakin' but not stirred
A woman who likes to be rocked out this world
Tonight I could show you some shit that I learned from the bad sex I used to have with some girls
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
