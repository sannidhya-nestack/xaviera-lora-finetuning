Man, I don't know what's going on
It's crazy times
My silent partner
You gone be there for me
Yeah
God be pull me through this
It's like you always been there when nobody else wasn't
Been through some times I call you my cousin
Gave me inspiration when I wanted to give up
I remember getting drunk off the rock and I give the what
Y'all know my ammo
Tryin to press it up and down
True enjoyment hold the mic
Been surrounded by the sound they keep tryna make
Sensor all the thoughts in my head
Stand at the ceiling
Now nobody wanna break bread
But since mom be gone
But just me and my microphone
In the unknown coco world
All alone
This ain't just rhymin'
It's real talk
It ain't a game
I've been
Reached the blood, tears, and pain
No other way to explain my life
My pen become my best friend
The one I talk through
Release my angin' feelings from within
My writing's a special tablets therapy
If I didn't speak my innermost
There'd be nothing left for my fancy
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have nothin'
In the show that pieced together life's puzzle
And I ain't seen the silver lining in years
Just more pain, more tears, too many presses, ain't clear
If you had my darkest hours, would you hold my hand?
When the gift took me too much, would you convince me to stand?
If I couldn't do it, would you execute the plan?
I'm borderline quicksand, barely making above land
It's never picked to live to earn they own stripes
Shed some light, give advice to help make your future's bright
So light crabs in the pad, no one wanna see you rise
The enemy's some camouflage, it's real friends in disguise
When I was down and out, nobody had my back
Where was y'all my low point?
Stopped me falling through the cracks
But I ain't see none of y'all
Just a room full of white walls, painted taxidermy
My everyday roll call
Doctor filling prescriptions
Ain't taking no medicine
He though the only antidote
To calm my aggression
After various evaluations
They labeled me unstable
But tell my stomach that was time
To put food on my table
I don't know the future hold on
What this world have for me here
But I ain't spent another year
In this dark room sitting in a chair
Y'all won't know the shift of yet
They be having raw, no snap
No school rap
Y'all ain't gonna dance to this track
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have nothing
In the show that pieced together life's puzzle
And I ain't seen a silver lining in years
Just more pain, more tears, too many presses ain't cleared
So at my darkest hour, would you hold my hand
When it gets to be too much, would convince me to stay
If I couldn't do it, would you execute
And I ain't bad so escape the voices in my head
Like deja vu bringing my spirit back from the dead
Cause somehow I lost my way or was really mad
And closed off from the world everyone
Like a woman battered what went wrong
Won't let me sleep at night, can't find a path that's right
I play gambles with my life, I control reality
I wanna live no more, straight reckless
Beating down suicide doors, my Desi hospital gown
Six feet deep in the ground, my every thought been expressed through breakdowns
I had some close calls, so blessed to be speaking to you now
Guess my angel watchin' Obi-Wan to keep me around
Who been in recession, tryna make due
Bitch, are your drains'cause they ain't close enough to reach out to
My silent partner, I thank you for pullin' me through
Of no tellin' if I be here expressin' these feelings so true
If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have nothin'
In the stroke that pieced together life's puzzle
And I ain't seen a silver lining in years
Just more pain, more tension, many pressures ain't clear
So at my darkest hours would you hold my hand
When it gets to be too much would you convince me to stand
If I couldn't do it would you execute the plan
I'm borderline quicksand barely making it above land
