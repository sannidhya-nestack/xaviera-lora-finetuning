Alright, cool, I'll be out in a second
Walking down the middle of the road
Yellow line divide caught in time
Looking up looking down low
Found a good way to go imma just trust my
Walking down the middle of the road
Yellow line divide caught in time
Looking up looking down low
Found a good way to go imma just trust my
Walking down the middle of the road
Yellow line divide caught in time
Looking up looking down low
Found a good way to go imma just trust my
With a sleight of hand, deaf touch
Careful now, handle
Fragile is the heart
It's all magic from the start
Look at me, look at you
How it glows, it's a go from the jump
Head first on the hunt
We in the building
Kicking down the back door
To give you more than what you asked for
Passing pages scattered on the floor
Catching all the green lights
Nothing like a good friend to bring you down
Nothing like an enemy to build your smile
Back to original
And that's critical
Pivotal to moving on
Starting over moved upon
Nothing like family
Point blank period
Nothing like love that is halfway serious
Soaking in the bathtub way past temperature
Rolling in the green grass
I remember her
Waking to a world where the days seem shorter
Thinking to myself where did time go
Feeling like I'm caught up, windows all boarded up
Stranger in my own home, knocking at the door
Keep the dream alive, from what you feel inside
Phoenix on the rise, through the ceiling and sides
I'll be about that truth, not to beat around the bush
Sick and tired of bullshit that people try to push
Feel the metronome that is ticking in your wrist
Heart on my sleeve and it's sticking out my ribs
In from the page to the blade like a tattoo
From a native shark to a razor with some bamboo
Real recognize
And it feels right, look from my mother's eyes, tell me you will be alright
Books in the middle line, tell me that there's more to life
Middle of the road down the tunnel and I saw the light (and I saw the light)
See what you see, and I saw the light (and I saw the light)
But you see what you see, and I saw the light (and I saw the light)
See what you see, and I saw the light, see what you see (and I saw the light, see what you see)
Slight of hand, deaf touch, careful now
Handle fragile is the heart, magic from the start
Look at me, look at you, how it glows, it's a go from the jump
Walking down the middle of the road
Yellow line divide caught in time
Looking up looking down low
Found a good way to go imma just trust my
Walking down the middle of the road
Yellow line divide caught in time
Looking up looking down low
Found a good way to go imma just trust my soul
Walking down the middle of the road
Kicking down the back door in time
First on the high, looking down low
Found a good way to go, I'ma just trust my soul
Walking down the middle of the road
Kicking down the back door in time
First on the high, looking down low
Found a good way to go, I'ma just trust my soul
First on the high
Kickin down the back door, first on the hook, kickin down the back door, first on the hook
First on the hook, kickin down the back door
First on the hook, kickin down the back door
First on the hook, kickin down the back door
First on the hook, kickin down the backdoor
First on the hunt, built it, kicking down the back door
First on the hunt, built it, kicking down the back door
'Cause, oh, man, I just went fishing, right? And I'm out there for ten minutes, I just caught a fuckin', uh, twenty inch, probably eight or nine pound fuckin' carp. I mean, it's huge, it was like, like an epic fuckin' battle. But anyway, I'm gonna try and take a picture, I'll send it to you, man, at that same spot too. Alright, man.
