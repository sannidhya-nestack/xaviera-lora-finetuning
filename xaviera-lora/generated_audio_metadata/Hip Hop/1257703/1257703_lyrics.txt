Fading
Dusty roads
We're weighing
The tall storms calling
Been so high and now I'm falling
Land down
Call it out
Southern shout
Feel the heat and no doubt
Road battle
Raise your hands
Raise a shout
Call it out
Call it
Call it
Call it, they so high now I'm falling down
Call it out, southern shout
Feel the heat no doubt
Raise your hands raise your shout
Call it, call it
Call it out, call it out
Something shout, feel the heat, no doubt
Raise your hands, raise a shout
Call it out, call it out
Call it out, call it out
Call it out, call it out
