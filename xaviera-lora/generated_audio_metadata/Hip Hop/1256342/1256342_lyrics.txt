Rolled up armor missing a horse just benzos
Cupid shot arrows we connected like legos
Lady in distress heart swipe right no tender
Rescue operations smoother than a master splinter
Can't break no mask just my mutt and swagger
Dragon ain't a problem slink sharp like a dagger
Windmills in the moonlight your night plain true
Silk verse velvet theme just me and you you
Madden shotting armor rapping on a heartbeat
Every word a rose petals on a small street
Chainmail of promises guard your soul tight
Go dance in the forest dancing through the night
Night is shining I'm a rabbit on a heartbeat
Every word a rose petals on a small street
Chainmail of promises guard your soul tight
Go dance in the forest dancing through the night
Shield up deflect doubts let's navigate the maze
On this love quest nights bleed to days
Through past hurdles no flight planned with delay
In your fortress won't be led astray
Raps serenade verses scribbled in gold
Lyrics encased in warmth chases away the cold
Paladin with the mic stakes high no fear
Every line a vow solid sincere
All the clings to live the melody of the light
Echoes of affection say burn your light
No damsel needs no saving just partners in crime
Together we call this way it beats time
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Night, night, it's shining on, we're rappin' on a heartbeat
Every word of rose petals on this long street
J. Miller promises, eous soul type
Romance in the bars, dancing through the night
Night, night, it's shining on, we're rappin' on a heartbeat
Every word of rose petals on this long street
J. Miller promises, eous soul type
Romance in the bars, dancing through the night
Romance in the bars, dancing through the night
All men sing the bars, dancing through the night
