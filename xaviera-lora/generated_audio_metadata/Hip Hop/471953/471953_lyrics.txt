And I'm way too dark, like when the sun goes down, yeah I'm shining
Like when the sun comes up, yeah I'm rhyming
Haters try and bring me down, I keep moving until the phones go up
We're the future, trust me I'm telling you beats are unique
And the flow is irregular, I flow like electric
Straight through the wire, I need to stop drop and roll cause I'm on fire
So don't get it twisted man
Cause I'm lethal when I got the mic in my hand
And most of these cats don't understand that
Decipher is the man with the plan so
Right now I'm here writing bars on my phone
I'm an idiot I left my pen and paper at home
So I'm here writing bars too
And ringtone on the bus with bare peeps but I'm still in the zone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
I'm writing these bars in my phone
Yeah I know everything that comes out my mouth's hot
I write bars in my phone and save them in my outbox
Technology sick it's always innovating
Inspiration nowadays it ain't wasting
Cause when I get an idea I push my phone buttons
I get a spark of an idea when I turn it into something
Sick really quick
And just like Trevor yo I make it a lick
I got a phone full of lyrics and now I think I got this
On my way to the studio then I lost it
Shit damn what am I gonna do it's like oh my gosh my career is through
Whoever finds my cell is gonna be a lucky man
So next time Imma make a backup
So I don't end up in the same situation
disappointment now is what I'm facing
I've lost all the bars in my phone
I've lost all the bars in my phone
I've lost all the bars in my phone
And now I think I'm gonna go home
I've lost all the bars in my phone
I've lost all the bars in my phone
I've lost all the bars in my phone
And now I think I'm gonna go home
