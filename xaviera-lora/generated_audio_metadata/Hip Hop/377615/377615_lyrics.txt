(Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
(Whiskey tango joke clap)
(Yeah)
(Ha ha ha, ha ha)
(And Rich Nice on the rap)
Ay yo this sunshine is shining in my eyes so bright
I wear sunglasses all day into the night
I got a funny feeling that this life can't get no better
Cause I spit so cool I got Hawaiians wearing sweaters
Man I been to the depths of hell, stood where the devils at
Took a look around and said hey yo the hell with that
I chill so hard on the beach with your shorty
Then I'm sitting on a Hollywood sign drinking a 40
Media puppet fat like John Lovitz
Kick my doodle rhymes because the middle class loves it
It's Rich Cronin man I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
Say Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn
Baby I say hotel, motel, holiday, check this shit out
Ayo I'm cruising down the highway in some old jalopy
Bumpin' Paul's boutique it's my original copy
I'm a high plains drifter
Playin' ankle twister in a million dollar house with Josh Duhamel's sister
I like girls that's worse than dead broke
Or billionaire freaks that drink and chain smoke
I don't really give a what in fact I'm quite nuts
I take these pink pills to keep my mind out of ruts
Have a crime being fetched
Never gave me crap
So I'm walking through the mall
Hitting girls from the gap
I'm a suave cat
I drink drinks with a swizzle
Squeezing on some Charmin to piss off Mr. Whipple
Say Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn
Baby, I say hotel, motel, holiday
Okay, I'm driving down Coinga with that chick Topanga
Hitting doobies at the movies, now we're home playing Jenga
She's in my sights, we'ma do it all night
Guess that kid Ben Savage ain't been doing something right
Get a taste of this, I know you're hating this
Because I'm groovy with the booty like I'm Julio Iglesias
It's Rich Nice, although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckas and you don't know how I did it (St. Hotel)
Motel Holiday Inn
Baby I say Hotel Motel Holiday Inn
Say Hotel Motel Holiday Inn
Maybe I'll say hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
