Uh, true, true
Say hello to the bad guy
Tell him to turn around true
Take over towns took the radio
Turn it off time to take a bow
Taking out too many clowns true
Tripping shut it down
Take a swing hoove boy tingle with the crowd
Try to tear me down true chillin here regardless
Tap a chin if dudes wanna pop ish
Pull your profits out all your pockets
Put your money up hater cause true got this
Reps and bench press some sets with a weight vest
40 pound chest get stretched if you talk mess
And I bet
You hide behind the internet
Firewall dudes who don't wanna intersect
Not in person but I'm learning back from introspect
Funny dudes see you and don't wanna interject
Not your friend but in the end they respect
The dude true like dude is a real threat
We ain't rocking with you haters
All we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch them catch papers
All I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
We ain't rocking with you haters
All we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch them catch papers
All I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
James in the building but you dudes aren't worthy
Why would you wanna reap the wrath of this rapper
Women willingly wild out we winning wet raptures
You will only have to, man true to master
Do it if I have to, I will beat the uh out a rapper
Even shatter, chitter chatter
Who nicer than me, no one because I'm badder
I'm after the gold and after that the platinum
Get on get up get down get it moving get your map up
This is what you been trying to be for years
You old and you unhappy not respected by your peers
You damn right cheers, toast to my brothers
There won't be another stupid jealous
Take it as a promise not a threat undercover
Spar with the great and the great make you suffer
We ain't rockin' with you haters
All we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch'em catch papers
All I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
We ain't rockin' with you haters
All we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch'em catch papers
All I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
We ain't rockin' with you haters
Get paper, watch'em catch papers
We ain't rocking with you haters, all we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch them catch papers, all I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
We ain't rocking with you haters, all we wanna do is live good and get paper
Sit back and watch them catch papers, all I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, all I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, all I gotta say to my haters is just thank you
