Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-Panky
Where the bullfrogs jump from bank to banky
With an eeps, ops, oopsie-doopsie
And a jelly-flopping belly-plopping kerplunk
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Don't tease the alligators'cause they're really cranky
With an eeps, ops, oopsie-doopsie
And a jelly-flopping belly-plopping kerplunk
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Down by the banks of the hanky-panky
Where the snakes they grow so long and lanky
With an eeps, ops, oopsie-doopsie
And a jelly-flopping belly-plopping kerplunk
Down by the banks of the Hanky-Panky
Down by the banks of the Hanky-Panky
Down by the banks of the Hanky-Panki
Down by the banks of the Hanky-Panking
