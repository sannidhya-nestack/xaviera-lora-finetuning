We're young, we're young, we're young and free
We're wild, we're wild, we're wild and free

It was too nice and too cool, yeah
Stars and the moon, yeah
It was too nice and too cool, yeah
We're young and free
We're young and free
We're wild and free
We're young, we're young, we're young and free
We're wild, we're wild, we're wild and free
We're young, we're young, we're young and free
We're wild, we're wild, we're wild and free
We're young, we're young, we're young and free
We're wild, we're wild, we're wild and free
We're young and free
We're young and free
We're wild and free
