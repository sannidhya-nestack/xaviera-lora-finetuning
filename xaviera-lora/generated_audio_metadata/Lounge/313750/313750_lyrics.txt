He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
The FCC can't shut him down
He broadcasts from a higher ground
Transmitters 99 feet high
Antenna reaching past the sky
He comes via satellite
Waves ripple through a star filled night
Ooh a star filled night
He's a pirate, pirate rail station
He's a pirate, pirate rail station
He takes over trucker CBs
As he sails the asphalt seas
The passing lanes a million strides
It's 4 AM, the time is right
This is when he comes in clear
From Idaho to the ionosphere
Ooh, the ionosphere
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
Signals strength and signals dim
I search the lonely dial for him
Looking for the love I lost
Sometimes the wires get crossed
Shorted out in electrical storms
Uninsulated wires can get you wrong
Love hits me like a lightning bolt
So little copper, so many volts
Ooh, so many volts
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
He's a pirate, pirate radio station
