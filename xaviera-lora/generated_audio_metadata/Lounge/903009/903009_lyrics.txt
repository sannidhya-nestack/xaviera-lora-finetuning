Shock entered mine
You see baby, the love we shared once before is now a crime
Well, well, yeah, yeah, you, you
You broke my heart with lies
Now baby, I can say
That I bet you didn't think
You didn't think I would
I recovered
I moved on, yeah
Thank you
Oh, thank you
Oh yeah
Oh baby, yeah
Shock entered mine
You see baby
The love we shared
Once before
Is now a crime
Yes you
Well well
Yeah yeah
You you
