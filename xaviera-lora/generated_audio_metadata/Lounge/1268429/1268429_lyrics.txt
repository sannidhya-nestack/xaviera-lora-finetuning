In the cool of the night we breathe
Beneath the stars we find our ease
In the silence we find our peace
Embraced by all the simple things
Wind whispers through the trees
Soft as a lover's kiss so sweet
In nighttime melodies play
Guiding us on a tranquil way
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dreams follow where the heart beats slow
In the moonlight's gentle glow
We drift on seas of calm and light
In the embrace of endless night
Beneath the sky so wide
We let the cares of days subside
In quiet moments we unwind
In the stillness peace we find
Oh, as the hours softly fade
We savor this serenade
In this place where stillness sings
We're wrapped in all that evening grace
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
