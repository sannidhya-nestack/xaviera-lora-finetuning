Sinking into the deep
Floating into the blue
In the ocean, lose yourself
Silence surrounds you
Peaceful and serene
Sunlight starts to gleam
Lost in another world
Beneath the endless sea
Aquarius
Lost inside Aquarius
Find a peace within Aquarius
Diving deep into the dark
Hearing the sound of my heart
Allow my thoughts to float away
Forever I want to stay
Aquarius
Lost inside Aquarius
Find a peace within Aquarius
Drifting in the endless sea
The silence she calls to me
