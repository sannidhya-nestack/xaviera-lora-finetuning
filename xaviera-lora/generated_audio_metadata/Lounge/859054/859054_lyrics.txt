Can't you see
The look in me
The look of love in you
Can't you feel
It's not easy
Letting go
But you don't ever see me
Clearly
And I don't ever hear you
Trying
Qu'est-ce que je vais te nommer?
Je vais te nommer
L'amour
L'amour
Oh no
L'amour qui chante
Doucement dans mon coeur
L'amour qui danse lentement dans mon coeur
Sans logic à la raison
L'amour et moi nous sommes un, nous sommes un
Can't you see?
The look in me, the look of loving you
Can't you feel it's not easy, letting go
But you don't ever see me clearly
And I don't ever hear you trying
I keep fighting what's meant to be
'Cause it won't be me
Let it all be iven
Let it go
Let it all be iven
Let it be
Let it all be iven
Let it go
Let it all be iven
Let me go
