Early morning light, we take a ride
Top down, feel the breeze by our side
Harvey sink with the ocean light
The lost and the world where moments hide
Melodies genicates the show
Every wave whispers just a little more
Carefully as the calls then soar
Ocean breeze and a lazy sun
Listening to the waves just begun
Strings are remade out of the new fundis file
Can't get over and done
We're gliding through just you and me
In this rhythm by the sea
When this dying wind whittled and strides
the fierce chimneys
So I was going in this barrel roll
Staring the way up the hole, no oh
I'll be okay in the whip of my hand
The world might think that I'm the music of a man
I see the lights, they're shining bright
But something just doesn't feel quite right
It hasn't been like Christmas yet
Ocean breeze and a lazy sun
Listening to the waves just begun
String serenade our afternoon fund is fine
You get over and done
As the sun sets, you paint the skies
Hand in mind, how gently flies
Chasing moments in our eyes
But don't walk through the sky
We'll dance'til the stars come alive
In this magic of our seaside drive
Every whisper, every sigh
In this fairy who dies, you thrive
