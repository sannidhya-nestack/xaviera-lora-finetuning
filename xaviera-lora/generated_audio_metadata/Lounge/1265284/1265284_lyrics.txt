Stars in the night
Whisper salty
Under the moon
We drift off to sleep
Echoes of past
Through the cool air
Your hand in mine
I'm no worries, no care
Memories of you in the twilight
Dancing in blue, soft glowing light
Time gently fades, but you're still near
In every beat and every tear
Moments we share, forever bound
In my mind's eye, your laughter sounds
Memories of you in the twilight
Dancing in blue, soft glowing light
