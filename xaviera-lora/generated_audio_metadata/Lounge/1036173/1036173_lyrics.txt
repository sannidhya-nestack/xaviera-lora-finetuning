Oh, here's something
Oh, now I can't breathe
No, no, no, no
Oh, here's something
And I'll remain a victim
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I can't breathe
No, no, no, no
I'm going down
my body will drown
Oh, no, no, I can't see, no, I can't be here
I'm going down, like my body will drown
Oh, no I can't see
No I can't be here
Oh for days now I've been lost in my mind
No I can't breathe
No, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I can breathe
No, no, no, no
I'm going down, that my body will drown
Oh, no, I can't see, no, I can't be here
I'm going down, that my body will drown
Oh, no I can't see, no I can't feel, yeah
All the days now I've been lost in my mind
No I can't breathe
No, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I can breathe
No, no, no, no
