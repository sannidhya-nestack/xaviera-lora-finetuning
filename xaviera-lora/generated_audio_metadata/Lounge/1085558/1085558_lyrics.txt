I feel like I'm flyin' now
You touch my hair
You make it so delicate
You give me peace of mind
You take me high
And I would love how we can
I don't know how but now I'm healing
And it feels like you make me wanna show my feelings
Yeah, I don't know how but now I'm healing
And it feels like you made me wanna show my feelings
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I feel like I'm flying now
You touch my hair
You make it so delicate
You give me peace of mind
You take me high
And now I know about the pain
I don't know how but now I'm healing
And it feels like you make me wanna show my feelings
Yeah, I don't know how but now I'm healing
And it feels like you make me wanna show my feelings
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
