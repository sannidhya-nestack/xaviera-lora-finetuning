I had a dream about him
I had a fantasy of love
I had a dream about him
I had a fantasy of us
He stood in my doorway with his newest jacket on
Took my hand and pulled me in
Then he whispered like a song
Fools in love
Fools in love
Fools in love
I'm a fool in love
I'm a fool in love
My desire tricked me
Wishing for a love that wasn't real
Desperation's taking over
If he only felt what I feel
He doesn't look at me
Like he looks at her
He doesn't see
She'll leave him, I guarantee
I would never, never, never
Never leave him alone
I'll love him for the both of us
my heart turns to home
Ooh, it's enough
Ooh
I'm a fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love, fool in love
For, for, for, for, for, for, for
It's
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
