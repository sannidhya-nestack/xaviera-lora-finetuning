As the waves of time
Slowly drift by
On this beat of mine
The morning breaks
Fade away
On holiday
On a midnight drive
Through the dead of night
Just you and I
Close your eyes
See the light
Feel all night
Is this heaven
Heaven in my head
Is this heaven
Heaven in my head, is this heaven?
Heaven in my head, is this heaven?
Is this heaven?
As the waves of time
On the speed of mind
The morning breeze
On holiday
On a midnight ride
Just you and I
Close your eyes
Feel all night
Is this heaven
Heaven in my head
Is this heaven
Heaven in my head
Is this heaven
Heaven in my head
Is this heaven
Is this heaven
Is this heaven, heaven in my head
Is this heaven, heaven in my head
Is this heaven, heaven in my head
Is this heaven, is this heaven
