I've got my toes in the sand with the breeze in my hair
Lazy days with no plans, not a worry, not a care
The saxophone whispers like a kiss on the cheek
In this lo-fi lounge tune we just relax at the beach
Watching waves softly roll as the sunlight fades down
Jazz guitar plays a role in this seaside town
The notes sway with the tide, cool and mellow they reach
In this lo-fi lounge tune
We just relax at the beach
Oh, the sun is setting low
Painting skies with its hues
The sax and jazz guitar
Blending reds with the blues
Feel the rhythm of the shore
Life's a lesson it will teach
In this lo-fi lounge tune
We just relax at the beach
Mojitos in our hands
Shared with dear friends by our side
Every moment feels grand
As we let the day slide
To the temple of the breeze
And the ocean's sweet speech
In this lo-fi lounge tune
We just relax at the beach
Let's et the fast plane
Trust the palm trees to calm
With each note, each refrain
Find our own healing balm
Hear the seagulls laugh
As the memories we bring
In this lo-fi lounge too
We just relax at the beach
Oh, the sun is setting low
Painting skies with its hues
A sax and jazz guitar
Blending reds with the blues
Feel the rhythm of the shore
Life's a lesson it will teach
In this lo-fi lounge tune
We just relax at the beach
Oh, the sun is setting low
Painting skies with its hues
The sax and jazz guitar
Blending reds with the blues
Feel the rhythm of the shore
Life's a lesson it will teach
In this lo-fi lounge tune
We just relax at the beach
