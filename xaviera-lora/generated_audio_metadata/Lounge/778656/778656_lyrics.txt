Oh, oh, oh
I'll be there for you every day
I'll make you stronger anyway
You were stood in the dark, now it's time for change
We're gonna get through this, there's no place here for blame
You were stood in the dark
Now it's time for a change
We're gonna get through this
There's no place here for blame
I'll be there
I'll be there for you every day
I'll make you stronger anyway
I'll be there for you every day
I'll make you stronger anyway
I'll be there for you everyday
You were stood in the dark
Now it's time for change
We're gonna get through this
There's no place here for blame
You were stood in the dark
Now it's time for change
We're gonna get through this
There's no place here for blame
I'll be there every day
I'll be there for you every day
I'll make you stronger anyway
I'll be there for you every day
I'll make you stronger anyway
I'll be there for you every day
(Osh)
(Osh)
