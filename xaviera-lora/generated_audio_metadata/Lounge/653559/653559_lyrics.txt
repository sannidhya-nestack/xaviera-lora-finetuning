Lost in love
We went out walking and got
Lost in love
Now I never want to find the path
That might take us back
Lost in love
Letting every footstep lead us on
Knowing somewhere there among the trees
We'll make memories lost in love
I'll make a wish by a woodland stream
And set it drifting to the sea
I want a love so real it feels like a dream
A whispered secret of the rustling leaves
Lost in love
Do you think they've noticed?
That we're gone
The sun is setting and the settings right
To stay lost tonight
Lost in love
I'll make a wish by a woodland stream
And set it drifting to the sea
I want a love so real it feels like a dream
A whispered secret of the rustling leaves
Do you think they've noticed that we're gone?
The sun is setting and the setting's right
To stay lost all night
Lost in love
Lost in love
Lost in love
