Long hours drifting with the scent so smooth
Electronic whispers keep me in the groove
Beat the beat, it's like a gentle embrace
Lights are low, shadows falling, no need to race
Long hours floating, lost chills fake
Electronic whispers taking me to a tranquil place
In the stillness of the night
White stones are shining bright
All I was drifting so free
In a drowning harmony
She'll have ice cream and a fox head glow
Down to the waves and a gentle overflow
Electrolyte pulses like a comedy type
Lounge made the stars and thrown spirits by
Long hours late to the lush trees I sit on
Electrolyte whispers and your lips spill down
The stillness of the night
While stars are shining bright
Long hours drifting so free
The electronic harmony
Lost in a space where time moves slow
Underneath the soft night glow
The electronic dreams fill the air
Long hours caught in melodies so rare
The stillness of the night
While stars are shining bright
Long hours turned to debris
In the track of your heart
