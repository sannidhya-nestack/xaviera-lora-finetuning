Think that you can never show me
You don't even really know me
Never paid attention to the slightest thing I need
Now the doors are way past closing
And my path already chosen
I'm so numb that I can't breathe
I'm living lifeless
Just help me out of this
Just help me out of this
I'm living lifeless
Just help me out of this
Just help me out of this
Now you struggle as I sign on
Only want what you don't have
It's just bad, bad
Thought we were best friends, but it's a one way street and you know that it can't last
Think that you can never show me
You don't even really know me
Never paid attention to the slightest thing I need
Now the doors are way past closing
And my path already chosen
I'm so numb that I can't breathe
I'm living life lit
Just knock me out of this
Just knock me out of this
I'm living life less
Just knock me out of this
Just knock me out of this
Just like the others
Just like the others
