Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh baby when you're near my heart is trembling
How we gonna get it on I am anticipating
There's something'bout you so attracting
One thing's for sure, you got me reacting
Oh, I can never get enough of you
No, no, never get enough, enough, oh
Ooh, enough of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby when you're near my heart is trembling
How we gon' get it on I am anticipating
There's something'bout you so attracting
One thing's for sure, you got me reacting
