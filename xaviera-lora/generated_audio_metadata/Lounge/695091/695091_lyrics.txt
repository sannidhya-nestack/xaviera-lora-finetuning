As the summer sun shines down on me
You're more out of reach than you should be
I know I'm lucky I have you and to you I'll run
I want you to know that
I got you on my mind every day
I got you and I feel it in every way
I've reached your moods
And I'm the only one
When I'm with you
A taste of paradise has come
I've got you
I've got you
You're on my mind, each and every day, how you do
And everything you say
Your face, your features
Body close to me
The way you make me smile
The way you smile at me
I got you on my mind
Ooh, I got you and I feel it in every way
I've reached your moons
And I'm the only one
When I'm with you
A taste of paradise has come
I've got you
I've got you
Oh, yeah, I got you
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah
I got you on my mind everyday
I got you and I feel it in every way
I read your moods and I'm the only one
When I'm with you a taste of paradise has come
I've got you, I've got you
