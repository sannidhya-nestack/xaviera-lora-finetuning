Angels sighing one by one
Faithless, waning, coming down the heavenly sea
Searched for signs but no avail
Poured water on the doors of hell
Friends becoming angry, yeah they lonely
Angels sighing one by one
Faces acquainted, come undone, the heavens sing
Church for signs to no avail
Poured water on the doors of hell
Prayers becoming angry, how they look for me
