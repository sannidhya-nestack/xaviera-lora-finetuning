We have all it takes to swing along
We shook our feathers out to wing along
We took the flight path off the swan song
We found our eyes dimmed by neon too long
Turn away
Turn away
Turn away
It's not too late
We have all it takes to fix the unknown
We have all it takes to forsake our own
We swim to the fireshows in the orange light
We found a fire bath, not water in the night
Turn away, turn away
Turn away, it's not too late
