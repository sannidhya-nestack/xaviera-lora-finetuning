Alone in my shadow feeling like I should
No one here to talk me, no one understood
Darkness all around me, silence
In the air
Walking through the empty
Living in despair
Echoes of the night
Dancing in my mind
Searching, hoping
Stars no longer shine
Moon has lost its glow
Alone in my shadow
Wandering through the cold
Loneliness is heavy
Tears rolling slow
Heart is feeling empty
Waiting for the show
Darkness all around me
Silence in the air, windy air
Walking through the empty
Living in despair
Echoes of the night, dancing in my mind, searching, hoping
Echoes of the night, dancing in my mind searching, hoping, hoping
Loneliness is heavy, tears rolling slow
Heart is feeling empty, waiting for the show
Echoes of the night, dancing in my mind
Searching, hoping, hoping
