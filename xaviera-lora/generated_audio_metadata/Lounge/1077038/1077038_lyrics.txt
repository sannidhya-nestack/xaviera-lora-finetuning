The light is so blinding, I know that you're smiling
And I've been trying to find my way out
Symbolic anointing, it's so disappointing
All of the ways that you've let me down
You say it's just one kiss, you know that I hate this
But you have the power to clear that from your mind
And well in time I'm just a dream to you
I'm not strong enough to tell you now myself
But one day soon I'll bring deliverance
I'm not strong enough to tell you now myself
But one day soon I'll bring deliverance
Slow down the river, I'm only a shimmer
Shivering, coming apart, I'm skimming
My knuckles are white, this dress is too tight
You turn out the light
I'm open as quick, you're making me sick
Don't know when I'd hit, feel like something bit me
And now poison's flowing deep inside
I'm not strong enough to tell you now myself
But one day soon I'll bring deliverance
I'm not strong enough
To tell you now myself
But one day soon
I'll bring deliverance
I'm not strong enough
To tell you now myself
But one day soon
I'll bring deliverance
I'm not strong enough
To tell you now myself
But one day soon
I'll bring deliverance
I'll bring deliverance
