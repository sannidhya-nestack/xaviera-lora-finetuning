Draw a picture of me in your heart
Light a memory of me in your eyes
And just call my name
And just kiss my forehead
And I'll be there
And I'll be there
Draw a picture of me in your heart
Light a memory of me in your eyes
And just call my name
And just kiss my thought
And I'll be there
And I'll be there

Draw a picture of me
Light a memory of me
