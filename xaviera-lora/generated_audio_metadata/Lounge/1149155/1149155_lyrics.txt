Something that it whispered so right
The wind seemed to pick up the light
The rays seemed to figure the sight
How did we miss it when so bright?
Finding the right notes takes time
Figuring the exact tune takes a while
Play me that music again
Sing me that lullaby of the rain
Flowing past to blue water where the rain
Dead points past
Everything down to name
Something that thundered in the night
Reminding of my dreams and the awakening light
The words faded from memory but wait
How did we miss it when so bright
Finding the right notes takes time
Figuring the exact tune takes a while
Play me that music again
Sing me that lullaby of the rain
Family past
To blue walls to hide away
Dead points past
Everything down to lane
