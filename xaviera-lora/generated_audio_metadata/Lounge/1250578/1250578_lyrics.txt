Moonlight flickers on the bay
Whispers of our yesterdays
Lonely hearts just drift away
I wonder when we'll meet again
Candlelight and soft refrains
Midnight dreams and overcame
Echoes of a sweet champagne
A question dances through my mind
Oh, when will we meet again
Beyond this fleeting place
Where shadows and whispers wave
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Stars that twinkle in the night
Hold our secrets soft and bright
Distance fades but feels so right
Your memory sings a lullaby
Time and space are thin veneers
Waiting through the yesteryear
Yet the future seems so near
When will our paths align in time?
Oh, when will we meet again?
Beyond this fading plane?
Where shadows and whispers wave
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, when will we meet again
Beyond this fleeting place
Where shadows and whispers wave
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
