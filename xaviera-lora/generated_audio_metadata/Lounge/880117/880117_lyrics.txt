Check check one two
It's been two nights
I can't sleep alright without your voice
Can't keep me warm on the telephone
But I'll try
Follow your dreams, love
It's what I shouldn't say
And I'll be waiting for you, love
At the end of the day
But I can't wait for you
Not one more day without you
I can't wait for you
Not one more day without you
Follow your dreams, love
It's what I should say
And I'll be waiting for you, love
At the end of the day
No, I can't wait for you
Not one more day without you
No I can't wait for you
