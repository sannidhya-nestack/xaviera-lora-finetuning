Oh, baby when you're near my heart is trembling
How we gonna get it on I am anticipating
There's something'bout you so attracting
One thing's for sure you got me reacting
Oh, I could never get enough of you
No, no, never get enough, enough, out (enough, out)
Ooh, enough of you (enough)
Ooh
Oh baby when you're near my heart is trembling
How we gonna get it on I am anticipating
There's something about you so attracting
One thing's for sure you got me reacting
Oh I could never get enough of you
No, no, never get enough, enough, oh
Ooh, enough of you, ooh
Oh baby when you're near my heart is trembling
How we gonna get it on I am anticipating
There's something'bout you so attracting
One thing's for sure you got me reacting
Oh I can never get enough of you
No, no, never get enough, enough, oh
Ooh, enough of you, ooh
