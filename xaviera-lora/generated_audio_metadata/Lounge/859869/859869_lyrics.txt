Raining down on me
I can feel the rain upon my skin
I can feel the rain upon my skin
Raining down on me
I can feel the rain upon my skin
I can feel the rain upon my skin
I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
The smell is bringing back the memories
The ones locked deep within
But it's too late now, I remember everything
But it's too late now, I remember you and me
And how careless we could be
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
The smell is bringing back the memories
The ones locked deep within
But it's too late now, I remember every scene
But it's too late now, I remember you and me
And how careless we could be
