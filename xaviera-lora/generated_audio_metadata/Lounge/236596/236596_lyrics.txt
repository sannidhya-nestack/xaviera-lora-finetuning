For the last day and night
An evolution in a billion years
There'll never be stagnation
Through all stages we move
Correctness or mistakes
Adventurous feelings carry on
Through urban nature's light
Graveled stone, bright city light
A little green in between
Take a look around
Try to figure out
That constant means change
Take a look around
You will figure out
Experience means change
Moving slow and faster times
Can't always plan your life
The convinceness of infinity
Another day, another night
To live and to learn sometimes serves
A way to grow stronger
Through the years you're going
Some changes in your life
Take a look around
Try to figure out
That constant means change
Take a look around
You will figure out
Experience means change
Take a look around
Try to figure out
The constant needs change
Take a look around
You will figure out
Experience needs change
