And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever I'm
And I'll ever own
I can't speak
And I'll ever own
And I'll ever own
And I'll ever own
I can't speak
And I'll ever own
I can't speak
And I'll ever own
I can't speak
I can't see,'cause it is too far off
For the four of us, until the boy up there comes to me alone
No, for it is too much for all of us, it's me
It's too much for all of us, it's me
Me
Me
I'm not ever alone
I'm not, I'm not ever alone
I'm not ever alone
I'm not ever alone
I'm not ever alone
I'm not ever alone
I'm not ever alone
I can't speak
I'm not ever alone
And I'll ever own
And I'll ever own
I can't see
And I'll ever own
I can't see
And I'll ever own
Across me
I know everyone is a sort of toy
