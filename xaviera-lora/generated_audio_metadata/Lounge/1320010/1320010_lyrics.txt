In time you may always see
What you wanted to be
Holding on to your soul
Let daylight take you home
What you want you can have
What you need you will become today
If only such a crazy day
Do like the wise men do
Take care of who's
Loving you
All this may pass in time
So turn water
The best that you are today
Let the morning stay away
Surrender to what will be
It's all bound to set you free
It's a lonely world, sad to see it
The winding road we walk alone
And on and on will we get to
The day you signed your life away
Say what you want to
All the worldly wise say
I will always love you
Deep in passing roads we see
Poor me I watch you play
While I'm just laying low
The best that you are today
Let the morning stay awake
When you got a place to stay
Who could make you go away
The best that you are today
Let the morning stay away
Surrender to what will be
It's all to set you free
I guess we are meant to play
The best that we can today
Let the wording do you well
Do it too well to say
It's a warning to the day
Behold the cost in shots
Get the ways communication
Say all there was to play
Leaves you all who was template, leaves you wondering through the day
We are all meant to care just to watch it serve you well
