All the light that we consume
The neon signs, the falling moon
Electric yellow and maroon
It penetrates, it makes us swoon
Colors grow and come alive
Into our veins, into our eyes
Millions marching in disguise
In the city of sin it's no surprise
All the light that we consume
The neon signs, the falling moon
Electric yellow and maroon
It penetrates, it makes us swoon
Colors grow and come alive
Into our veins, into our eyes
Millions marching in disguise
In the city of sin it's no surprise
I'm your lover
I'm your lover
In the city of sin it's no surprise
In the city of sin it's no surprise
In the city of sin it's no surprise
In the city of sin it's no surprise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
