I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Feeling lost and out of place
Empty eyes look upon my face
Nowhere to go, nowhere to run
I just want to find someone
To take me home
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Take me home
At the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road, at the end of the road,
Wish that I could belong
I've been searching for so long
This place I'm in makes me feel numb
I just want to find someone
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Just take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home, take me home
