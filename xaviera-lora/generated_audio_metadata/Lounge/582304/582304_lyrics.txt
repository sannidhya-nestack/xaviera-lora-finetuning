Ooh, a new day is dawning
Ooh, ooh
I wipe the tears, the tears that fall like the rain
Tears the whole world is crying
Feel the piercing of the sorrow and the pain
And I say oh a new day is dawning
Ooh, the new day is dawning
Ooh, I wipe the tears
The tears that fall like the rain
Tears the whole world is crying
I feel the piercing of the sorrow and the pain
And I say oh a new day is dawning
