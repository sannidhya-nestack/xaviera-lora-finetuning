Heroes in our hometown
I can take it all now
Bleeding from the mouth
Cut it out, cut me out
I don't go to sleep
Not a riches swim deep
Toxic waste slips into me
In, in
Can't, can't, can't
Oh look, he's shaking, not long'til we break him
Playing with his gun just for fun, shall we wake him?
Jaw dropped, gormless, watching me give orders
Fulfill my vision, cutting with precision
Cutting with precision
Heroes in our hometown, I can take it all now
Bleeding from the mouth, cut it out, cut me out
I don't go to sleep, not awake, just swim deep
Toxic waste slips into me, in, in
Can't, can't
