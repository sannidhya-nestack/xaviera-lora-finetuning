Like an angel as a flame
Coming from a burning bush
I will lead you away
Let's run away
Getting smaller every day
Wasting away
There's a storm brewing in the distance
The light is flashing behind the clouds
A word lost, all that never was
The distance grows
For the mother's son
Reflected in screen
And blown along the path
Nightmares we dreamed
Left unseen
Paper is peeling off the walls in the corner of the room
I catch a glimpse of you
Flash a déjà vu
I'm reading from the page like you asked me to
About the history and the way it ought to be
A word lost
I was never the distance grows
For the mother's son reflected in the screen
And flown along the path
The nightmares we see live unseen
A word lost, all that never was
The distance grows
From the mother's son
Reflected in the screen
And blown along the path
The nightmares we dream
Live unseen
You know I fell
And I found strange things
The day the house burned down
And we stood and watched not able to breathe
And the rain would wash away mistakes that were made
As the lights flicker in the shadows
There will be no way to go
A word lost, all that never was
The distance grows
For the mother's son
Reflected in the screen
And blown along the path
The nightmares we've seen
Live on dreams
[Silence]
