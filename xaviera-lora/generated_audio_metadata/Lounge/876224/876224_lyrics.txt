Too long inside my mind
Those carefree weeks behind
Just thinking of the times
When summer's almost mine
Too long here on my own
Too many days have flown
Remembering you were mine
We were wasting time
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
The sun and you
Too long without your light
Too many lonely nights
I need your cold kiss
Spend some time like this
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
The sun and you
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
Sunshine always does it for me
The sun and you
You always get the best of me
In any weather, you always give the best of me, oh
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine always does it for me)
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine, sunshine)
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine always does it for me)
The sun and you
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine always does it for me)
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine, sunshine)
Sunshine always does it for me (sunshine always does it for me)
Yes, I am you
