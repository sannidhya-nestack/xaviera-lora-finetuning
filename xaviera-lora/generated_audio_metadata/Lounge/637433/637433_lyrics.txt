I'm gonna trip along, trip along
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
Wait for no one
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
I'm gonna trip along, trip along, wait for no one
I'm gonna trip along on the moonlight
See how the silver fills up every landscape
Every breath, every finger, every tear
See you, see you, see you, see you
See how the silver fills up every landscape
Every breath, every finger, every tear
I'm gonna trip along, trip along, wait for no one
I'm gonna trip along on the moonlight
Hear how the star shines against the black night
Every tingle, every sparkle, every musical key
Hear how the star shines
Against the black night
Every tingle, every sparkle
Every musical scale
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
Wait for no one
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
On a moonlight
I'm gonna trip along, trip along
Wait for no one
I'm gonna trip along
On a moonlight
