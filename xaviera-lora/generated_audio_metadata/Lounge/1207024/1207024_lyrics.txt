I can feel your love slipping away
But I just don't want it to go astray
Can we find a way for you to say
Together in each others arms too late
Words we have
And we don't wanna let the other win, yeah
Pain inside is hard to et
I guess I'm gonna have to
You lose like a drug
Killing me slowly
Maybe we're just like nothing to me
Can't keep live like this
Is it time to leave?
We fight and we scream
But just can't break free
Trapped in a cycle
Tearing us apart
Know that we're toxic
But we can't make a start
Can't we put the bright aside
I just wanna see you smile
Feel like every fucking time
You show up then I lose my mind
Can we put the past aside
And then make up for the lost times
Baby I wanna make it alright
Can't you just say that you're mine
Your love's like a drug
Killing me slowly
Maybe we're just like
Not meant to be, not meant to be
Can't keep playing like this
It's the time to win
We fight and we scream
But just can't break free
If it ends, the killing of our time
How can we be sure that this is love?
You lose like a drug, killing me slowly
Maybe we're just like, not meant to be
Can't keep living like this
Is it time to leave?
We fight and we scream
But just come back free
