Weird is the strange affection
It's too much to ask for
It's too much to whisper
Weird is the strange affection
It's too much to ask for
It's too much to ask but breathe in me
There is a strange affection
It's too much to ask for
It's too much to ask but breathe in me
Where is this strange affection?
It's too much to ask for
It's too much to ask but breathe in me
Where is this strange affection?
It's too much to ask for
It's too much to ask for
Pray and leave
