Everything, when we're alone
Our cravings, be as they are
All in all
What we'll do, yeah
We're so happy
How could we make mistakes?
All night long
All alone
Everything, when it's all known
I'll claim it's high speed and slow
On and on
One word to give
We're so happy
How could we make mistakes
All life long
All alone
