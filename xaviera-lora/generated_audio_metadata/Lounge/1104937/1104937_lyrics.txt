Няне, сперых видуга, няне, сперых видуга
I can never et how heady it can get
Sitting atop the hill, soaking up the sunshine
Head full of dreams
An heart full of murmuring whispers
I can never et
How you pulled me towards you
How you pulled me towards you
I can never et
The rain dries the blood, spear through the blood
Over the hills and the steppes
The sun tries to shine
Over the grapes and the oranges
I can never et how you look
With your eyes scrunched up against the brilliant light
How you held out your hand
And pulled me towards the glittering sea
I can never et the many times
We ot how to breathe
ot how to speak
ot that we lived in a world of strife
We had a moment, and we seized the day, seized life, seized now
Which remains today with me
The rain dries the flowers over the hills of the day
The sun tries to shine, over the grapes and the oranges
