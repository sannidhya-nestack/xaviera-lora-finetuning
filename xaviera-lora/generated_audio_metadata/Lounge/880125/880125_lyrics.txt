Why did you come for me?
Why did you come for me?
I don't wanna go
Why did you come for me?
The other day I said I don't wanna go
I didn't listen to you, no, no, no, no, no
Who do you think you are?
I'm just a girl you're leading me on
Hold me like the man I know you are
Hidden from you, I'm out, I say
On your petty excuses, excuses
On your petty excuses
All over town you've been screaming my name, no, no, no
I've got all the things on my mind, I won't answer you
Trust me, you don't wanna be my girl
I won't waste my time
Waste my time
I'm just a little girl, I'm just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl, just a little girl
She says, "Who's that girl?"
She says, "Who is that girl?"
Be like me, be like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, be like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, be like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, be like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, stay like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, stay like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, stay like me, in the end you will be like me
Be like me, stay like me, in the and you will be like me
Be like me, be like me and you will be like me
Be like me, be like me and you will, be like me
