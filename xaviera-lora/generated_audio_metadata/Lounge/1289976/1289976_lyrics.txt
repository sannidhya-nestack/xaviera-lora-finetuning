Underneath the moon's soft glow
I drift away while a cool breeze blows
Floating on a dream out of sight
In this tranquil scene, the stars ignite
In this tranquil scene, the stars ignite
Whispering secrets, the night unfolds
Lost in a rhythm where time is gold
In the night where dreams are blind
Feel the calm, let the stars shine
We fight peace in the silent spring
Moon stream plays setting spirits free
Walking through shadows with ease
In the night's embrace, our soul finds peace
Colours blend in a mystic dance
Under disguise, past expands
They coincide, a gentle song in this sacred space
We build
In the night, where dreams align
Feel the calm, let the stars shine
We find peace
In the silent stream, moon's replay, setting spirits free
This life, it dreams of you, so high, in sky so low
You lose roots, you are not certain, unknown strings hold you in the ground
In the night, where dreams align
Feel it come, let the stars shine
We find peace, in the silent spray
In the silent spray, moon stream plays
Setting spirits free
