Stairs upon the temple I climb and I crawl and
Wonder how much further I'll go, ooh
Feet that fall apart'til I walk on my ankles
Can I finish, I just don't know
People travel millions of miles just to see it
But they never conquer this way, ooh
I can tell them the greatest games have conditions
But they're too far to hear what I say
Stairs upon the temple I climb and I crawl and
Wonder how much further I'll go, ooh
Feet that fall apart'til I walk on my ankles
Can I finish, I just don't know
People travel millions of miles just to see it
But they never conquer this way, ooh
I can tell them the greatest gains have conditions
But they're too far to hear what I say
People travel millions of miles just to see it
But they never conquer this wave
I can tell them the greatest gains have conditions
They're too far to hear what I say
