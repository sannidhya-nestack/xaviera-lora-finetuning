I've had the same dream, making the same calls, yeah
Seems like insanity, send myself off to home
Home
I'm trying to learn from all of these mistakes
I'm trying to lock my heart before I break
No matter all the twists and turns we make
Still the same thing, it's the same thing, oh
So look me in the eyes and say out loud
'Cause life is short and we ain't got no clout
Don't set me up'cause you feeling too proud
It's the same thing, still the same thing, hey
Still the same thing, yeah
Still the same thing, yeah
Hey, still the same thing
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had the same dream
Making the same call day
Seems like insanity
Set myself up to fall
Home
Home
