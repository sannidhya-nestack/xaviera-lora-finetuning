Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Sitting in the land of illusion
On top of a hill
Changing the point of view
Destination ahead
Rotating circus, arms wide open
Stitch of confusion can read between the lines
Counting the clutches as they go by
No thought of today, the moment is now
It's not worth the same
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
It's not worth the same
It's not worth the same
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
It's not worth the same
(Outro)
Different stages will lead you to
A door you've never looked through
Careful step along the hallway
Face it all, stand up tall
Isn't always the same (always the same)
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
Isn't always the same (isn't always the same)
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
And I was the same
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
It's always the same
It's always the same
Night is ending your day
Inhale all the good vibes
It's always the same
