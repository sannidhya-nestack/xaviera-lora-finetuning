Let me dry
I'll drive down this road
I'll drive down these roads
I'll go down these roads
I won't tell you where I'm going
No no no
Let me drive
Drive away
I'm painted red
I'm painted red
I'm painted red
I won't look back anymore
Won't tell you where I go
I won't be long, oh
No, I won't come back for you
Trapped here I'm like a star in a cage
Oh
My heart, my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
These roads go forever
I don't know whoever picks me up
I'm going strong
Leave me here I won't be long
These roads
The day I die, I'm coming for you
Day I die, the day I die, I'm coming for you
The day I die, the day I die, I'm coming for you
The day I die, the day I die, I'm coming for you
The day I die, the day I die, the day I die, I am coming for you
The day I die, the day I die, the day I die, I am coming for you
The day I die, the day I die, the day I die, I am coming for you
The day I die
Day I die, the day I die, I'm coming for you, the day I die
Day I die, the day I die, I "m coming for you, the day I die
Day I die, the day I die, I am coming for you, the day I die
