I know it's been a long time, long time to see
I know it's been a hard time, hard time to leave
But I'm not broken down now that I found what I need
I know it's been a long time, such a long time to see
Just put your heart where your love is
Just put your heart where your love is
I know it's been a long time, long time to see
I know it's been a hard time, hard time to live
But I'm not fucking down now that I've found what I need
I know it's been a long time, such a long time to see
Just your heart, your loving
Just put your heart where you love it
I know it's been a long time, long time to see
I know it's been a hard time, hard time to live
But I'm not fucking down now that I've found what I need
I know it's been a long time, such a long time to see
Just put your heart where your love is
Just give your heart your loving
