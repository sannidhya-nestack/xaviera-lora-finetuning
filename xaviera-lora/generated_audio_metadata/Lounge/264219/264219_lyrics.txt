Going to the places that I love
Under a blue devon sky
Where dolphins come into play
You watch the clouds passing by
And every time I leave
A part of me stays here
Again a brighter day
And you know it feels so good
Out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
Under a blue sky
Under a blue sky
I'm going to the places that I love
Under a blue sky
I came now brighter day
And oh it feels so good out in the sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Easy living by the sea
You watch the clouds passing by
Out in sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in sunshine
Easy living by the sea
Out in sunshine
Down on the beach
Out in the sunshine
Is it living by the sea?
