You didn't have to stop to say it
You never had to put your heart on the line
And now we're at the crossroads making
Excuses just to stop and talk for a while
I can't believe
I can't believe
That you would break my heart
I can't believe
I can't believe
That you would break my heart
I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the dark
You didn't have to stop to say it
You never had to put your heart on the line
And now we're at the crossroads making
Excuses just to stop and talk for a while
I can't believe
I can't believe
That you would break my heart
I can't believe
I can't believe
That you would break my heart
