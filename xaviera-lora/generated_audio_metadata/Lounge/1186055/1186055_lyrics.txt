You say you're better than me, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, say you're better than me, yeah
You wanted my love, yeah, you want my love
You say you're better than me, yeah
Took all my time and it's not enough
I want it all, want it all with you
Give me all, give me all of you
I want it all, I want it all with you
Say you'll find me there
I'm in the middle of the road
