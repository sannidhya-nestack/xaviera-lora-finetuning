Buffaloes kept me awake all night
Buffaloes kept me awake all night
I gave myself three years to get over him
I burned my thoughts to warm myself up
Under a sea of thick dough
I tried to swim to reach the mail
I tried to swim to reach the mail
Blaze myself with tastes never tried before
I travel through what I think I know
Under the way of lights
I try to close my eyes to see through
I try to close my eyes to see through
You are the power I know (sets myself off)
You don't even know (try my faith)
How far you can go (blink my eyes to see clear)
You are the power I know (sets myself off)
You don't even know (try my faith)
How far you can go
Give all the power I need (fix myself up)
You don't even know (tryna think)
Of why you can't go (can't make my eyes do see clear)
You (fix myself up)
Give all the power I need (tryna think)
You don't even know (can't make my eyes do)
Of why you can't go (see clear)
