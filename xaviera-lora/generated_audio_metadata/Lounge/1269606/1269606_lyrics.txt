I saw a feather fall, floating through the air
Light as a whisper's call, but I didn't see you there
In dreams we often fly so high above the ground
Reaching for the sky when no chains are found
Dreams of a feather will light as a breeze
Together or never with hearts at ease
Walking through the night, stars shining so bright
You catch a glimpse of light and everything's alright
Lift your wings and glide
Feel the world so wide
No more need to hide, love is on our side
When the morning breaks our dreams slip away
But the feeling takes us through another day
Dreams we often fly so high above the ground
Reaching for the sky where no chains are found
Dreams of a feather
We're lying as a breeze
Together or never with hard sides
Walking through the night
Stars shining so bright
We catch a glimpse of light and everything's alright
Lift your wings and glide, feel the world so wide
No more need to hide, love is on our side
When the morning breaks our dreams slip away
But the feeling takes us through another day
