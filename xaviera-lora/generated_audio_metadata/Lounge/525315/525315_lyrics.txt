So what you say about the day
I live and dream in all our desires
Our eyes are dancing with the music playing
It's a blossom day
I've got to tell you I'm in love with you
And did you know that you would blow
My heart wide open like this
I know a charm, so take my arm
Our hearts pounding harder with each kiss
I know you know that we must go
Run away alone at last
Your body's swaying and your eyes are saying leave that boss a serenade
I've got to tell you I'm in love with you
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
And what you say about the day
So what you say about today
