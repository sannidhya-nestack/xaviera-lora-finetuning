Eyes so in the evening glow
Moonlight kissing skin so still
Floating through dreams letting go
Silent as this rip of my soul
Feel waves, pray or something risk
Lost in night's tender trace
Stars weave stories in the air
Every note a gentle prayer
Rhythm dancing soft and fair
Hold the moment and all with care
Echoes of what's yet to come
In this journey I'm undone
Breathe in the mellow vibe
Feel the warmth inside
Glide on the ambient tide
Let the music guide
Dive deep
Let the sound flow
Through and through let emotions grow
All the colours softly show
In the soundscape
Let's follow
Breathe in the mellow fight
Feel the warmth inside
Glide on the ambient tide
Let the music guide
