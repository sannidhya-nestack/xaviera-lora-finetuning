Dusty eats where footsteps fade
Echoes linger sweet serenade
My heart keeps time with a tune untold
Yet your silence feels so cold
I dance alone in twilight's glow
Hoping you'd see what I can't show
The rhythm plays soft and low
But love it seems won't ever grow
Heartbeats sink yet worlds apart
A melody sung to a guarded heart
The notes drift up like misty part
Unrequited love, it's a painful art
Every passing sigh a quiet plea
Hoping you'd hum the tune with me
Crescendo dreams dissolve bittersweet
While the beat repeats'neath weary feet
Streetlights flicker where shadows play
I trace the steps you slipped away
The saxophone wails a moon so deep
That even stone hearts might lose their sleep
Heartbeats sink and worlds apart
A melody sung to a guarded heart
The notes drift up like misplayed part
Unrequited love, it's a painful art
Every passing sigh, a quiet plea
Hoping you'd hum the tune with me
Crescendo, dreams dissolve, bittersweet
While the beat repeats'neath weary feet
Streetlights flicker where shadows play
I trace the steps you slipped away
