I drift away tonight
In the city's hum
Neon streams through the glass around you
Silence breathes the stars on your skin
When you hold me
Whispers dance through shadows, silently serene
I wander through the night in electric dreams
Echoes sway with the lights beside you
Darkness fades whenever you draw near when
Whispers dance through shadows, silently serene
In this quiet calm
We find our rhythm lost in the moment
Floating on the breeze
When you hold me
Whispers dance through shadows
Silently serene
