Don't let the maker wish out of you
Fade is hanging on a black and white contradiction
In the light of fire with no cover
There's no escaping your connection
Your worst nightmare has come to fruition
Fruition
Shaking hands with face
Knowing something isn't right and you're losing sleep
And those witches you believe you don't even see
I gotta make a witch out of you
Don't let the maker reach out a view
Who will be the next?
Who will be the next?
Who will be the next?
Who will be the next?
Fate is hanging on a black and white contradiction
In the line of fire with no cover
There's no escaping your connection
Your worst nightmare has come to fruition
Don't let them make a witch out of you
Don't let them make a witch out of you
Don't let them make a witch out of you
Oh, right away
