Oh my, walking in the rain never felt right
Till you came along and got me so high
You go on and on to get me through
I knew, I knew that's how you do
Sometimes I sit back and watch as you go
Sometimes I wait'cause my mind's saying no
But you got me hooked from my head to my toes
And when I'm with you I, I wanna lose control
Oh my, walking in the rain never felt right
you came along and got me so high
You got one and one to get me through
I knew, I knew that's how you do
I wanna lose control
I wanna lose control
I wanna lose control
Yet when I'm with you I
I wanna lose control
Sometimes I sit back and watch as you go
Sometimes I wait'cause my mind's saying no
But you got me hooked from my head to my toes
And when I'm with you I, I wanna lose control
I wanna lose control
I wanna lose control
I wanna lose control
Yeah when I'm with you I
I wanna lose control
