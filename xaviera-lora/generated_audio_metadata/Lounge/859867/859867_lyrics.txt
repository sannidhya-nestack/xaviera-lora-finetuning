I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
Hypnotizing me
I don't wanna look away from you
I can't seem to look away
I'm hypnotized by you
I'm hanging on to what you say
I'm hypnotized by you
I wanna know you
Wanna feel how fast my heart would beat if you were close to me
I wanna show you
Wanna let you loose inside my brain to see if you'd run or stay
I don't wanna look away
I don't wanna look away from you
I can't seem to look away
I'm hypnotized by you
I'm hangin' what you say
I'm hypnotized by you
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
I'm hypno-hypnotized
