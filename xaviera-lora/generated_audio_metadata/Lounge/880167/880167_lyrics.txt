So dance with me
We can be whoever we want to be
And the stars will shine for us
And for the start of love
Lights dim but your gaze is all I see
I'm daring you to make the first move
Light's dim but your gaze is all I see
In your eyes I can see you won't be
I'm daring you to make the first move
Is this a game of love?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh
So dance with me
We can be whoever we want to be
And the stars will shine for us
And for the start of love
