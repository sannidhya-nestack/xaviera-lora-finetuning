If there were no space
I could reach the stars
I would weave them into

Watch the fish swim from my perch
If there were no space
I could reach the stars
I would weave them into
The streets and the cars

High up in the sea of space

And the colours leap out in time
I'm going diving out of space and time
I'm going diving out of space and time
I'm going diving
I'm

I'm going diving out of space and time
I'm going diving out of space and time
I'm going diving (I'm going) in the air I'm going diving
