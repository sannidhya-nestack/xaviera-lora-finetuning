Gotta get away before my hair's on fire
I don't recognize my face no more
I know a little place that feels just right for me
Where I can turn my cares over to the South China Sea
On the road every mile
Feels like the air is shedding my old skin
And every wave of the tide calling a new life to begin
Let the current carry my soul
And I can give up control
Living in the city shadows
Chasing every diamond that glows
I won't deny
But now I see more brightly
And leave the race behind me
I feel alive, oh
Take me down to the water
Where the sun paints golden skies
I'll take you to the market where the colors collide
Let your nose and music be your guide
On the road every mile
Feels like the air shedding my old skin
In every wave of the tide calling a new life to begin
Let the current carry my soul
And I can give up control
Living in the city shadows
Chasing every diamond that glows
I won't deny
No, but now I see more brightly
And leave the race behind me
I feel alive, oh
Take me down to the water
Where the sun paints golden skies
I'll be alright
