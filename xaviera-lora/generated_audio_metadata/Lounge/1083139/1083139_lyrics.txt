I tried to run when the nightmare begun
But I couldn't move, too afraid to disapprove
It felt like falling in the deep, just to wake up asleep
Running scared in a bad dream
Blinded by what I've seen
I'm playing out the record
Dance around the room
Hallucination
When all is gone
The cards are drawn
I'm ready to play, ready to stay
Nothing more that you can say
As the night goes on
Chance of sleep is close to none
Your words keep me awake
Realize all that's at stake
Good thing about a nightmare
It's nothing more than a scare
You're nothing more than a bad dream
Nothing I can read in
I'll play another record
Dance around the room
Hallucination
Show you I can redefine
A glass of wine I'll redesign
Taking back all that is mine
When all is gone
The cards are drawn
I'm ready to play, ready to stay
Nothing more that you can say
Hallucination
Hallucination
Hallucination
Hallucination
Hallucination
A resolution
A resolution
A resolution (I'll show you how to redefine it)
(I know I don't need it but I'll take it back)
(All that is mine)
A resolution (I'll show you how to redefine it)
(I know I don't need it but I'll take it back)
I'll show you how to redefine and find someone to redefine
I'm taking back all that is mine, I am divine
I'll show you how to redefine and find someone to redefine
I'm taking back all that is mine, I am divine
I'll show you how to redefine and find someone
I can't define it, I can't define it, I can't define it, I can't define it, I can't find it, I can't find it, I can find it, I can't find it, I can't find it, I can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it, can't find it
(I can't be mine) I'm not the one to read the signs
Show you how to read the signs
Take it back, hold that in mind
I can't be mine
(I'm not the one to read the signs) I'm not the one to read the signs
