I drifted off last night
Under neon lights
A sea of stars glowing just above you
Whispered dreams reflect on your smile
Oh and you
Oceans of calm surrender, suffering reciting
I slipped into a dream
In the midnight glow
The war softens in the space around you
Shadows dissolve in the warmth of your gaze
And when you hold me
Oceans of calm surrender
Softly
Hold me
Suffering night
Night fades gently in your quiet embrace
Tender, timeless
Forever suspended when you
Oh hold me
Oceans of calm surrender
Softly reciting
