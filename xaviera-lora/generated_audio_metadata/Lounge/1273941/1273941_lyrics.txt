I hear the wind whisper in the night
So quiet, so near, so near
Your eyes meet mine like soft breath here
Like time stands still just the two of us and the lights glow
Can't feel it too
Calm that fills this space
Your hand in mine we melt
Like snow falling gently
No words just feelings
Like an unspoken promise
Like twins stand still just the two of us and the lights glow
Can you feel it too the calm that fills this space
Your hand in mine we melt
Like snow falling gently
No words just feelings
Like an unbroken promise
Like time stands still
Just the two of us and the lights glow
Feel it too, the calm that fills this space
Stay here a little longer, let the silence speak now
We blend together, two souls in the embrace of calm
