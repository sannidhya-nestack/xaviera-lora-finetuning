Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There is a drought in my mind
My thoughts are covered in the sand
I try to find a water source
A river or an ocean ghost
Who might help with what I seek
Can't believe it's so hard to think of one way out
Out of this heat
How will it end?
I don't feel like I need to correct
This absolute mess that I make
With every single breath I take
There's still a drought in my mind
And a flood that's drowning me, alright
Completely blind, completely blind
I poured my tears in a glass
Watered my plants
And drank the rest, and drank the rest
From drought to flood, so obscene
That's my very own inner evergreen
That's my very own inner evergreen
Ooh, it is that drains my mind
Whatever makes me write these rhymes
It is that drains my mind
Whatever makes me write these rhymes
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
There is a drought in my mind
My thoughts are covered in the sand
I tried to find what I sought
A river or an ocean ghost
Who might help me with what I see
Can't believe it's so hard to think of one way out
I'll leave it here
I pour my tears in a glass
Pour all of my plans
And drink the rest
And drag the rest from drought to flood
So obscene
That's my very own inner evergreen
That's my very own inner evergreen
Makes me write these lines
It is the dreams my mind
Whatever makes me write these lines
Is this a phrase by my mind? Whatever makes me like this
