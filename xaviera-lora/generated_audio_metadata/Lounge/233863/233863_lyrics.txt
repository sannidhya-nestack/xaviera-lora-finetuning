A little bit of time to build up your life
A little bit of time to find your dreams
A little bit of time to make up your life
A little bit of time for yourself to say
You, you say that you have lost your way
Gotta save strength for another day
Ups and downs, your life is just a mess
Don't you give up just to take a deep breath
A little bit of time to build up your life
A little bit of time to find your dreams
A little bit of time to make up your life
A little bit of time for yourself to think
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
You, you feel that you can do what you like
Feeling controlled like a little child
Gotta tell them how you feel
No regret, no regret
Don't let them push you into little forms
A little bit of time to build up your life
A little bit of time to find your dreams
A little bit of time to make up your life
A little bit of time for yourself to sing
A little bit of time, a little bit of hope
A little bit of time to build your life
A little bit of off time for yourself to see
A little bit of time to build up your life
Do do do do do do do do
A little bit of time, a little bit of hope
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
A little bit of time, a little bit of faith
