I'm not about to stay
It's just not for me
I just don't feel free
Hey
I'm not about to stay
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
It's just not for me
I just don't feel free
It's just not for me
I just don't feel free
I'm not about to stay, it's just not for me
I just don't feel free
I'm not about to stay
It's just not for me
I just don't feel free
Hey
(Ballin' up) (Ballin' up)
All alone
