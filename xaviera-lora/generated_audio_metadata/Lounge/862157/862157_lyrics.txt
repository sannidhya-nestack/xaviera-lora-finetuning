I've been a little more than you can handle
I know, I apologize for all the things I did to you
Lead in the lights
Tonight we'll leave in the lights
Tonight the lights are low, they're low
The lights they're low, yeah the lights they're low
Dim the lights, dim them out, turn it off
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm nobody's fool tonight
I'm nobody's fool tonight
Oh, oh, oh that's right
I'm nobody's fool tonight
I'm exotic
There's fire in your veins
There's fire in your veins
I'm not the one you're looking for
I've been a little more than you can handle
I know, I apologize for all the things I did to you
Leave in the lights tonight
Leave in the lights tonight
The lights are low, they're low
The lights they're low, yeah the lights they're low
Dim the lights, dim them out, turn it off
Do you think I want this?
I've been a little more than you can handle
I know I apologize for all the things I did to you
There's fire in your veins
There's fire in your veins
I'm a painted soul leaving my body and I'm leaving the lights
And I'm leaving the world tonight
I'm a painted soul leaving my body and I "m leaving the lights
And I'm leaving the world tonight
I'm a painted soul leaving my body and I'm leaving the lights
And I'm leaving the world tonight
Keep moving, it's time to get out of the dark
Keep moving, it's time to get out of the dark
