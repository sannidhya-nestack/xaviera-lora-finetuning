I had a dream
Of a void with no face
He wrapped me up in a warm embrace
Lately I've been feeling
Quite out of place
I guess I had to be
Reminded somehow
Reminded somehow
This game I've been playing
Isn't a race
This way I've been feeling
Is nothing more than a phase
More than a phase
We both were sad in the shade of a tree
A tree that grew wild and free
Not once did she rush
And fill herself with worry
She said, try not to hurry
Why don't you hush, why don't you hush
This game we've been playing
Isn't a race
This way I've been feeling
Is nothing more than a phase
More than a phase
Why don't you hush? (Why don't you hush?)
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you hush?
Why don't you rush?
