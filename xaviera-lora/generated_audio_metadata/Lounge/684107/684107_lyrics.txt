I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing
And I'm stuck up, and I'm stuck up
And I'm stuck up, and I'm stuck up
(What you need, what you need, what you need, what you need)
(Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go)
(What you need, what you need, what you need)
I'm so fucked up, I'm so fucked up
I'm so fucked up, I'm so fucked
