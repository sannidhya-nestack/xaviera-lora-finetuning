Ooh, light flickers on the bay
Whispers of all yesterdays
Lonely hearts just drift away
I wonder when we'll meet again
Candlelight and soft rephrase
Midnight dreams and overcame
Echoes of a sweet champagne
A question dances through my mind
Again, beyond this fleeting claim
Where shadows and whispers wane
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Oh, when will we
Meet again beyond this fleeting plain
Where shadows and whispers wait
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Stars that twinkle in the night
Hope our secrets soft and bright
Distance fades but feels so right
Your memory sings a lullaby
Time and space are thin, they're near
Wading through the yesterday
Yet the future seems so near
When will our paths align in time?
Oh, when will we?
Again, beyond this fading flame
Where shadows and whispers wait
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Oh, when will we meet again?
Beyond this fleeting plane
Where shadows and whispers await
And love's eternal flame shall reign
Ooh
