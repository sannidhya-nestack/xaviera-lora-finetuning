Show me your fears
Show me your scars
Let me see the worst parts in your life
Hey yeah
I know deep down deep down
Deep down deep down
Deep down down
Show me your fears
Show me your scars
Let me see the worst parts in your life
Even if you're scared
I'm not the only care
Please stop doing that
Show me your fears, show me your scars
Let me see the worst parts in your life
I'll even make you feel
We fly, we fly
Show me your fears, show me your scars
Let me see the worst parts in your life
