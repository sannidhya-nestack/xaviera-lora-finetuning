Here I am, I know it's been a while
I was in denial about my love
Here I stand, I know I walked away
Had to find the person I'd become
I was high and I was low
Moved through mountains, rain and snow
But I felt that I was further from the truth
In the dark and stormy night
Rolling thunder, flashing light
Heard a whisper in the night
And it said
You should go back home, go back home, go back home
Go, it's been there all along
You should go back home, go back home, go back home
Go, that's where you belong
You should go back home
You should go back home
I was high and I was low
Moved through mountains, rain and snow
But I felt that I was further from the truth
In the dark and stormy night
Rolling thunder, flashing light
Heard a whisper in the night
And it said
You should go back home, go back home, go back home
Go, it's been there all along
You should go back home, go back home, go back home
Go, that's where you belong
You should go back home, go back home, go back home
Go, it's been there all along
You should go back home, go back home, go back home, go
That's where you belong
