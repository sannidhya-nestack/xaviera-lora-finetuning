When the sky is full of clouds
My heart is full of you
And I just got to say that I
Feel so lucky to be with you
when the sun starts shining bright
I feel so happy inside
And I was gonna tell you that
I loved you so won't you please just stay by my side
When the sky is full of clouds
My heart is full of you
And I just gotta say that I
Feel so lucky to be with you
when the sun starts shining bright
I feel so happy inside
And I was going to tell you that
I loved you so won't you please just stay
