I wander through this quiet midnight
Searching for the answers lost in life
These walls they echo quiet whispers
Of dreams I hold beneath the big dipper
In this surreal still moment of time
I'll find a peace in this internal line
Breathe slow and easy, dive into the calm
Where the waves of serenity embrace the palm
Let the whispers of the universe guide you home
We'll find solace in this endless roam
The moonlight crafts shadows on my skin
A tapestry of stories waiting to begin
Every heartbeat, the rhythm currently
In the sanctuary of night secrets we keep
As the stars crochet their tails so bright
I'll dance with their glow into morning's light
Breathe slow and easy, dive into the calm
But the waves are sure as he embraced the fog
And the whispers to the universe guide you home
We'll find solace in this endless realm
In the echo of soft love, eyes are drift
Sailing through the dreams on the gentle lift
The world melts away as the twilight comes
In the silence I were, I drew along
Breathe slow and easy, dive into the calm
Where the waves of serenity embrace the calm
Let the whispers of the universe guide your home
We'll find solace in this endless realm
