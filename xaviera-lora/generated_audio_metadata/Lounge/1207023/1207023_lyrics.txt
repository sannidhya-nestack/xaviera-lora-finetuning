I, we've been waiting
And I, I've been waiting to hear from you
Why can't you just face it?
Clouds are leaving the sun
How many chances I get for your love?
Guess why can't you just save me?
The clouds are leaving the sun
Lost in your light
I just can't deny
It warms me up
Then fill me with your undying
Can't go back no more
This is my day
It'll be alright, guess you're right
Couldn't think that I should've said
Said that I want you every day
But I knew I'd fail
What can I say?
On brighter days we will be okay
Lost in your light
I just can't deny
It warms me up
Then fit me with your heart
I know that I can't go back no more
This ain't no day it'll be alright
Yes you're right
Yes I've been watching the skies
Think about you all the time
Yes I've been watching the skies
Think about you all the time
How can I make it up?
I'm addicted to your love
And why can't you just see it?
The clouds are leaving inside
Lost in your light
I just can't deny
It warms me up
Then face me with joy
I know that I can't go back no more
Sooner or later it'll be over I guess you're right
Close to your heart
Close to your heart
I just can't deny
Here unto you (face me with joy)
Then face me with joy (can't hide out of love)
Can't slow back no more, it's a new day, it'll be over, I guess you were right
Here's how we would you disguise
I think about you all the time
Here's how we would you disguise
