There's a secret power
That fulfills your dreams
In light of golden sunbeams
Has no wings but flying
Braving elements
It leads you through pink heavens
Magic flights afar
Let this mystery begin
And chant and surprise you
Just what wink you'll find
Imagine here the fire that
Keeps me flying higher and
Keeps me flying higher and
Is healing my desire
Words and my own creation
Imagination is leading me
My fantasy castle show
Faster than the sunlight
Wanderers join and leave this place
But never show their traces
Breaking laws of nature
Giants, witches, fetish tribes
Friends of our creator
In this hell is hell
Magic voyage may begin
Enchant and surprise you
Just one wink you'll find
Imaginated fire that
Keeps me flying higher and
Keeps me flying higher and
Is healing my desire
Words of my own creation
Imagination is leading me
My fantasy castle sure
Golden word on my fingertip
Flying high in my fantasy castle show
Golden word on my fingertip
Flying high in my fantasy castle show
Romantic, living fire
Keeps me flying higher and
Keeps me flying higher and
As if my desire was of my own creation
Imagination is fleeting me
My fantasy castle shone
The mountain where the fire light keeps me flying higher and higher (that keeps me flying higher and higher)
This is my desire (is still in my, is still in my desire)
