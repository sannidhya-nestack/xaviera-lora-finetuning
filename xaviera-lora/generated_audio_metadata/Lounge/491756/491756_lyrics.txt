You are the one
I am the one
Open your eyes, the brightness within them
Turn to me, see me smile
The sun shines through an open window
Warms me, makes me smile
You are the one, I am the one
It's so fine, I feel that you're with me
When I go away, sometimes
I can't deny
I know that I'm dreaming
You're beautiful
You catch my eye
You are the one
I am the one
Don't you let me go
Please say you are
Don't let me go
Please say you are
All the time I've been looking for you
Waiting for a sign
All the world knows what I'm saying
Heaven is a place on earth
you are the one
I am the one
Don't
Don't let me go, please say you won't
Don't let me go, please say you won'
