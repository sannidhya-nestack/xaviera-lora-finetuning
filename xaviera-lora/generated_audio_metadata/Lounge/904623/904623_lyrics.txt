The water is raging like it's a storm
As I dream of you all night long
The water is raging like it's a storm
As I wait for you
All night long
I want you beside me
All of the time
As I look at you
Knowing you're mine
The wind keeps on blowing
On and on
As I lay with you
All night long
Maybe you can stay with me and we become inseparable
Maybe you can stay with me all night long
All night long
