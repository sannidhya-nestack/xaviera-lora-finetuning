Staying tonight a while
Stay to watch the moonlight
Stay in the quiet of the night
Stay to watch life smile
Because it's right
Let's chill and dwell
Where hearts dwell
Head on and on the clock
Merging in time for a spell
Stay to watch shadows play
Stay to see five lives dance in the sway
Stay in the silence of the white
Stay to watch when it turns light
Stay because it's right
Let's chill and dwell
Where hearts dwell
Head on hand on the clock
Moving in time for a spell
Let's chill at twelve
Where hearts dwell
Head on, head on the clock
Merging in time for a spell
