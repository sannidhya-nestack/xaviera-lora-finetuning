There's a lot that she's asking for
There's a lot that she's asking for
Mmm, enough silence is too much
Mmm, enough silence is too much
Who is it, who is it and why did you do it and
What is there to it and maybe I blew it and
Who is it, who is it and why did you do it and
Maybe I blew it and
Lights are out and there's sweat in your embrace
There's one other thing I dare
Lights are out and it's time to leave your faces
Believe me
There's nothing there
There's one other thing I dare
There is not a tear
There is not a tear
