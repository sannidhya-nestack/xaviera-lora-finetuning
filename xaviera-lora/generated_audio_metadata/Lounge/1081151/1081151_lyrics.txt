Two tongues are easy to paint
Portraits are pretty simple
Landscapes breathe onto the canvas
Flowers bloom over night day
Her essence is hard to trace
Now the light comes close to replace
Your features are so hard to erase
Just a word, but it's not the rose I embrace
Seascapes swirl into a vein
Barbie heels appear from thin hair
Figures take shape, head of the vine
Trees, clouds, a sky so fair
Your essence is hard to trace
Your light comes close to replace
Your features are too hard to face
Just a word but it's not the rose I embrace
Your presence is hard to trace
Now the light comes closer to replace
Your features are too hard to face
Just a word but it's not the rose I embrace (embrace)
