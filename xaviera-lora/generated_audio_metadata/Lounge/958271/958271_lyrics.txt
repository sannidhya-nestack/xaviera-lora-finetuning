You always want what you can't have
And when you have it you can
Restore my heart the moment I laid eyes on it
How do you know how you will feel
When everything changes with fear
Where will I go, and who will you be
How will I know
The one for me
The other one for me
The other one for me
'Cause you always want what you can have
And when you have it, you can
Do what you can have
From what you have if you can't
you always want what you can have
From what you have if you can't
Do what you can have, for what you have you can, you can
