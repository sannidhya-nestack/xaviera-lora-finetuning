In the city I think of you
And how we wanted something new
We were split at the core from the start
Finding ourselves miles apart
Riding a current of apathy
Even inside you're off my mind
Stay out of sight and off my mind
Even inside, you're off my mind
Stay out of sight, and off my mind
And it feels alright, I cut all the ties
Why try to win, when there's nothing to fight
In the city I still think of you
We were split at the core from the start
Finding ourselves miles apart
Riding a current of apathy
Even inside you're off my mind
Stay out of sight and off my mind
Even inside you're off my mind
Stay out of sight, stay out of sight
Woah, even inside you're off my mind
Stay out of sight and off my mind
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
