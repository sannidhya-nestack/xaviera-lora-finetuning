Stay the way on the summer night
Breeze away through the skylight
Sail away at warm midnight
Bliss away on the moonlit hide
Stay away on the summer night
Reach away through the skylight
Safe away at warm midnight
On the moonlit high
Steal away
On the summer night
Breeze away
Through the skylight
Sleep
It's a warm midnight
Bliss away
On a moonlight hide
