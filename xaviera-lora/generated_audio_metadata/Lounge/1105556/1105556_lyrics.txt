Wish that you'd call me'cause I'm on my bed
Still waiting for you to mean nothing else
Stay outside, I will run from my home
Any way better than inside alone
Stay outside, I will run from my home
Go my own
Go my own
'Cause I need your hand on my shoulder
You want it too, don't you babe?
Everything around is so annoying
Anyway better than inside alone
Everything around is so annoying
On my own
Oh, oh, oh, oh
