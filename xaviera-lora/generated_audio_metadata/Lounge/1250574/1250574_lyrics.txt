Long time no see my friend
Feels like forever
Where did all the time go
Now we're here together
Remember those nights
Talking'til gone
Laughing in the moonlight
Now those days are gone
Long time no see
Can we start anew
Rewind the moments just me and you
So let's take it slow
Memories in the breeze
Hearts open wide
Time's the only thief
We can build again from where we left
Moments just for us, no more time to theft
Long time, oh see, can we start anew?
We want the moments, just me and you
So let's take it slow
Memories in the breeze
Hearts open wide
Time's the only thief
We can build again
From where we left
Moments just for us
No more time to think
Long time, no see, can't be starting new
Be one of the moments, just me and you
