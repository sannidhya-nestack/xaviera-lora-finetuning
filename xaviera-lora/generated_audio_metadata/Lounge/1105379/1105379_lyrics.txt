I don't know when I fell in love with you
I don't know when the clouds rain falls on you
Stay with me now, moonlight
Blue night, stay with me now
Dream light, hot side, share with me now
Sunlight, rainbow slide, share with me now
Sea light, blue night, stay with me now
Wave kite
Take me out to the dance floor
The breeze sways
Take me out to the sea floor
The moon it plays
Take me over to the night floor
The star he weighs
Take me over to the sky floor
The clouds dance
I don't care how
The stars go out every night
And I don't know why
Your smile feels so right
Stay with me now
Moonlight, blue night
Stay with me now
Dream like
Hot side
Share with me now
Sunlight
Rainbow slide
Share with me now
Sea light
Where you can
Take me out to the dance floor
The breeze sways
Take me out to the sea floor
The moon ain't place
Take me over to the night floor
The star he weighs
Take me over to the sky floor
The clouds dance
