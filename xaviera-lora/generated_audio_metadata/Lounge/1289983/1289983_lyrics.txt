Waves in the skyline glow, city asleep, dreams unfold
Silent whispers in the night, lost in the haze, nowhere to hide
Greens and moonlight, soft as dawn
In this tranquil moment I belong
Floating high above the noise
In my heart I find my voice
Peace and calm where dreams align
In this moment I am fine
Rhythms read like a gentle breeze
Time stands still, I'm at ease
Moonlit shadows embrace the scene
Moments captured in between
Echoes of the sobering past
In this place I hope it lasts
Floating high above the noise
In my heart I find my voice
Peace and calm where dreams align
In this moment I am the find
Floating high above the noise
In my heart I find my voice
Peace and calm where dreams align
In this moment I am fine
