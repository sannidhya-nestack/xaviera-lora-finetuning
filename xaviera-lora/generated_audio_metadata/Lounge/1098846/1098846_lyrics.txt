The night falls like mist, right into my mind, a twist
A fate on my list, I couldn't make it to the twist
Life winds on amidst
Every possible story or gist
I feel so sunkissed
Despite all that was missed
et me not
The memories fade
et me not
The future's made
et me not
The years do change
et me not, life is fully paid
The wilds of my heart are true
Full of dreams with no rules
Like a fragrant coffee brew
Made by a faithful few
Dwelling in me, bursting anew
The beats are like drops of dew
I feel so sun-kissed
Despite all that was missed
et me not
The memories fade
et me not
Though a future is made
et me not
Though years do jade
et me not
Life is fully paid
