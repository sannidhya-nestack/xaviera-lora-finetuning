On the open road we've got a ways to go
Switching lanes I can't regain control
Can't turn around now I've got no place to go
Chase the sun, ride the wind, race the rain
Find something new
Breakthroughs, let's go too fast, don't look back
I wanna drive'til our hearts crash
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the moonlight
Right by your side I'll drive all night
Shift gears and slow it down love
So far from where we were
There's nothing else around us
Now the past is just a blur
Chase the sun, ride the wind, race the rain
Find something new
Break the rules, let's go too fast
Don't look back
I wanna drive'til our hearts crash
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the moonlight
Right by your side I'll drive all night
All night
All night
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I wanna drive'til our hearts crash
Racing so fast, hold on love
Up in the sky, in the moonlight
Right by your side I'll drive all night
