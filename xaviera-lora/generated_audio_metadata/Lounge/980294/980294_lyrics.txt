And it grows, it grows in you
It flows through you
You crave it, elevate to it
Feel it in your mind, feel it in your soul
It's time to raise to another level
No longer will we plateau
It's time to rise and grow
And it moves
It grows in you
It flows through you
It grows
It flows through you
Feel it, feel it, feel it
So tight (feel it)
It grows in you
It flows through you
It grows in me (It's your only, it's your only)
It grows in me (It's your only, it's your only life)
It flows through you (It's your only, it's your only)
It grows in me (It's your only, it's your only life)
It flows through you (It's your only, it's your only)
It's your only, it's your only, it's your only life
It's your only, it's your only, it's your only, it's your only life
