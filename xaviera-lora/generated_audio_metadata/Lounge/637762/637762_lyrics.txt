Love
You are still just mystery
A haunted beauty taking all my waking hours
But when I go to the place only I know
There is still a silhouette, a silent remnant of your face inside of me
Facing me, nothing but your face I still see
You are still just mystery
A haunted beauty taking all my waking hours
When I go to the place only I know
There is still a silhouette
A silent remnant of your face inside of me
Facing me
Nothing but your face I still see
There is still a silhouette, a silent remnant
Of your face inside of me, facing me
Nothing but your face I still see
