Feel the rain drops on my face
Sky is dark but I'm amazed
In the storm I find my grace
Puddles form my sweet embrace
Shoes left far behind my door
Jumping high and wanting more
Lost my worries to the poor
Dancing wild, it's what I'm for
Dance in the rain, won't be the same
Splashing around, call out your name
No more pain in this weekend
Everything's gone, let your remain
Clouds above, they sing a tune
Lightning strikes, we're dancing soon
Underneath the silver moon
We'll be free'neath monsoon
Happiness in every drop
Out of time we never stop
In the downpour we will hop
Rainy nights are on top
Dance in the rain, won't be the same
Splash in the room, call out your name
No more pain in this weekend
Everything's gone, let joy remain
Hmm, hmm, hmm
