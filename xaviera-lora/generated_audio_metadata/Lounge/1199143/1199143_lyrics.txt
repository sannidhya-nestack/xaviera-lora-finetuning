Into the other green world
Another world where hope could flourish
Another world without a past
Imagine pride dissolves by grace into the other
There was a time I probably told you
That we are all asleep on wind
And we should wake
We can find our way into the other green world
Sometimes sleeping on the wind
I can hear it call
Sometimes, sometimes
Oh, I can see it show
So even when this world
Rejects you
Just try to take some comfort in
Knowing someday you'll find your way
Into the other green world
no one here is born alive
Into the other green world
