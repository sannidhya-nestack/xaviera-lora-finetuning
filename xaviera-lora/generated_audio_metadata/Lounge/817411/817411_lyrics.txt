Mon Cherie, come into my mind, I am a cosmic girl, let me enchant you, I'm coming from the red planet, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun, the gateway to the sun.
Este es el ritmo de Latinoamérica
A sentir el ritmo
Que quiero ver gozar
Let me show you something you've never seen
Free your head, free your head, trip
To the way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way
Enjoy us please us
Este es el ritmo Sudaka
Y el maravilloso Partido
You know so
Te quiero ver
Yeah, baila
Make me move, soulful house
You tell me all these things you wanna do to me
But lately you're just talking baby I need blue juice
There's something deep inside me how it turns for you
And even though it's there you'll have to see it through
Qué maravilla,
Duas para cada abrazo.
¿Estás gustando?
¿Usted jura?
You tell me all these things you wanna do to me
But lately you're just talking baby I need blue juice
There's something deep inside me how it burns for you
And even though it's there you'll have to see it through
Te quiero ver (yeah)
You tell me all these things you wanna do to me
