Hard to carry around (carry around)
Without feet on the ground (feet on the ground)
Before I spread my wings (I spread my wings)
Say farewell to this town (well, to this town)
He stood there, alone and confused
Not really sure of what I should do or where I should go
The only thing I could hear was a cold, pale silence encompassing my heartbeat
I knew the skies were blue and the sun was shining
But my mindset was telling me otherwise
What could I think?
Everything seemed to be fleeting away from my grasp
Was I done?
Or was this only the beginning?
Frankly, I may never know
The one thing I knew was that it was gone
Forever
And I just stood there
Wondering if it would ever return
City skyline on fire
Street lights shine with desire
Wind blows against my skin
Currents pushing me high
And if we all just float away
So far from where we came from
To find a new angelic place
Though our mistakes were undone
A new beginning with our end
A new release without pain
Would we repeat our faults once more?
Would we not know how to change?
(This is just the beginning)
Scale line on fire
(This is just the beginning)
Shine with desire
Against my skin
(This is just a game)
Pushing me up
