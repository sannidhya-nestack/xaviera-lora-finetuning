It's time to say goodbye to you
Try to make it work, it's true
I need to find my own path
I just want no more tears
So no more fear
It's time to be alive but I can't
Build a time, it just goes by
I still love you, I can't be with you
It's hard to let go, I'm holding on, it's just too sad, no, no, no, no
Love me has faded away, I don't wanna stay
Gotta go my way
I'm sure you're thinking I didn't try enough
But here I am
Closer than ever to the end
New steps alone
Guess it's hard
Tell me one more time
It was real, was it real?
Will I ever love?
Love again, tell me one last time
Was it real, was it real?
Love behind has faded away
I don't wanna stay, I gotta go my way
I'm sure you're thinking I didn't try enough
But here I am
Close in and error to the end (ooh)
Fall out of love
Get some out of luck
Get some out of (ooh)
Fall out of love
Get some out of luck
Get some out of luck
Fell out of love, guess I'm out of luck, guess I'm out of who?
