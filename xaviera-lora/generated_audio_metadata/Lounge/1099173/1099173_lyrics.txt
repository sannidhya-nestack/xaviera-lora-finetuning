You can find me
Waiting in the dark
Hide away my spot for the world to see
You can find me
Holding back my heart
Can't hurt me anymore
I'm free
I am more than you could ever know
The sun lights up my glow
I am more than you could ever know
Burning before your heart
You can find me, waiting in the dark
Hide away my spark for the world to see
You can find me, holding back my heart
Can't hurt me anymore, I'm free
I am more than you could ever know
Sunlight's up my glow
I am more than you could ever know
Burning before your eyes
I am more than you could ever know
The sunlight's up, I glow
I am more than you could ever know
Burning before your eyes
