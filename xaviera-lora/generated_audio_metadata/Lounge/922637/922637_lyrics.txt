It's easier to fly away
I feel like a God, God, God, God
Late night to the top, top, top, top
I'm living like a God, God, God, God
Off the gas with my dog, dog, dog, dog
I've never been a sore loser
Then again I'm never losing
Never been blind to the boom
Don't make me end up choosing
She had a twenty-eighter phone with her skirt, skirt, skirt
Get four and ten on ten up the skirt, skirt, skirt
Yeah, I cannot be bought and can't replace me
I built this from the ground, baby, I made me
Even if you cover up my eyes so I can't see
I'ma kick you in the face like I'm Bruce Lee
I feel like a, I feel like a, I feel like a ,I feel like a, I feel like a, I feel like a, I feel like a
I feel like a God, God, God, God
Late night to the top, top, top, top
I'm living like a God, God, God, God
Off the gas with my dog, dog, dog, dog
I just need you to know this
I wasn't always like this
I almost had to end it
It took my whole life yeah
I'm not being cocky
I'm just seeing what's on my mind
And I'm not tryna flex
I'm just happy that I made it out alive
