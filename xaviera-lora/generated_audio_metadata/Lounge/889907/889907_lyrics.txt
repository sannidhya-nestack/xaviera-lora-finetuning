I can't remember my name
I'm not quite certain what I'm doing here
I can't remember my name
I'm not quite certain what I'm doing here
I feel safe in your arms, I feel safe in your arms
Keep me warm, keep me warm, keep me warm
I can't get my feet on the ground
Angels are flying all around me
I can't get my feet back up on the ground
But the angels are flying all around me
Feel safe in your arms, feel safe in your arms
Keep me warm, keep me warm, keep me warm
I was feeling so sure
I would remember who I was
It would be different, different this time
I wouldn't have so much to learn
Now I feel a little lost, I feel a little lost
Maybe you, you could tell me my name
I can't remember my name
I'm not quite certain what I'm doing here
I will remember
I can't remember my name
Angels are flying
I'm not quite certain what I'm doing here (I'm waiting for a kiss)
I feel safe in your arms
Feel safe in your arms
Keep me warm, keep me warm, keep me warm
Keep me warm, keep me warm, keep me warm
And maybe you could tell me my name
