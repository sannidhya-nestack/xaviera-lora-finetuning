She walks upon the golden sand
The ocean whispers take her hand
The sun's a melting tangerine
In this moment she feels serene
Each wave, the promise, soft and dear
Seashells sinking close to you
Sky blushes pink with twilight's glow
Her heart at peace, she starts to know
At the edge of endless blue
She finds who's so she finds what's true
Sunset hues paint our dreams
In this quiet life it deals
Footprints trailing where she's been
Future whispers in between
Every step a dance in time
Hope and healing intertwined
At the edge of endless blue
She finds herself she finds what's true
Sunset hues paint your dreams
In this quiet life, your dreams
Night descends with fear
In the dark, a light will come
Her spirit sings, no sense of gloom
At the edge of endless blue
She finds herself, she finds what's true
Sunset views, pale dreams
In this quiet life of tears
Night descends, the few won't stay
Stars will guide her on her way
In the dark, a light will bloom
Her spirit sings, no sense of gloom
