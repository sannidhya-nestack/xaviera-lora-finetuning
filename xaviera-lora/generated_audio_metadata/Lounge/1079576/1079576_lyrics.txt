(Outro)
Falling, up, up, up
Falling, deep, deep, deep
I'm in my soul
In my soul
Falling, up, up, up
Falling, deep, deep, deep
I'm in my soul
In my soul
I see it
It's in my head
I feel it in my feet
I feel it in my feet
I'm here
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I know
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I know
I'm here, I'm here, I'm Here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I know
I feel so broken
