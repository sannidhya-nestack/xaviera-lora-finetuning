I love you
In love
In love
Broke my heart you tore it in two
So why am I still thinking of you
Broke my heart you tore it in two
So why am I still thinking of you
In love
In love
All the things that we wished they never came true
All the promises made were broken by you
All the choices you made would you make them again?
All the lies that you told, did you believe in them?
Broke my heart you tore it in two
So why am I still thinking of you?
I don't wanna be in love, ooh, in love, ah-ah
In love, ooh, in love, ah-ah
I don't wanna be in love, ooh, in love, ah-ah
In love, ooh, in love
Of you, of you, of you, of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you
