This one's for me, the blood that I bleed
Darkness I see, everything that I need
This one's the fight, inside of my mind
The pain in my heart, and still overnight
And this one's for sorrow, the guilt that I bear
The cross that I swear, the weight on my chest
And the sadness I wear, and the questions I ask
Did I do my best?
Me at all, I'll never show, no I'll never show
Deep my love goes, you'll never know, you'll never know
Me at all
That I can do my best (I can do my best)
That I can do my best (I can do my best)
The secrets I keep inside of my heart are feeding on me
While I sleep in the dark I finally see our truth was a dream
And when my heart grows I'm ripped at the seams
But you'll never know'cause you don't believe
You'll never know'cause you never knew me
You'll never know'cause you don't believe
You'll never know'cause you never knew me
No, you never knew me
No, you never, never, never, at all
