It goes wrong, you hold on
Cause that's what you know
A fresh start with two hearts
No beating alone
Emotions change, you look away
Pretending they don't
And goodbye and all eyes now left to reload
Come back down it's calling
One more shout I'm falling down
Take my hand I'm all in what you say
No, come back down, it's calling
One more shout, I'm falling down
Take my hand, I'm all in, what you say
Come back down, it's calling
One more shout, I'm falling down
Take my hand, I'm all in
What you say? No
Come back down, it's calling
One more shout, I'm falling down
Take my hand, I'm all in
What you say?
Go strong, you hold on, cause that's what you know
