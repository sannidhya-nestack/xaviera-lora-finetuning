Some might buy you roses
And call you by your name
But they all left and scattered
When the soldiers came
Some might list out reasons
Or write you poetry
But I can keep you safe
When the clouds turn grey
There's a fire in the sky, oh-oh-oh-oh
And you're the reason why, oh-oh-oh-oh
For your love, baby
I'd start a war for your love, baby
I'd start a war
I'd start a war
I'd start a war
I'd start a war
I start a war
And they may know the answers to the questions in your mind
They might have a lot of money that could buy you time
But I'll just hold my fists up high
And swing'til I hit the floor
Because for you I'll hold the line forevermore
There's a fire in the sky, oh
And you're the reason why, oh-oh-oh
For your love, baby
I'd start a war
For your love, baby
I'd start a war
I'd start a war
I started a war
I started a war
I started a war
I'd start a war
