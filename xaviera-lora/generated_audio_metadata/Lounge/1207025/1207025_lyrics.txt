I pray she is
Going to be blessed
Hoping your daughters
Find their own way back home
Who are you?
At the heart of the matter
They can't change a thing
From the heart of the matter
You can't change who you are
Time will teach us
Till we are one again
Will you trust it in the morning
As your heart breaks again
She cares about you, do you know the answer
Do you
You believe in kings and queens
At the heart of the matter
They can't change a thing
From the heart of the matter
You can change who you are
At the heart of the matter
They can't change a thing
From the heart of the matter
You can't change who you are
At the heart of the matter
At the heart of the matter
