'Cause the man I dreamt I had
Well you see I drove him mad
Sent me to the deep
I was warned once, twice
About my secret life
Send me a storm
the man I dreamt I had
Well you see I drove him mad
Send me to the deep
And take it no more
I was warned once, twice about my secret life
Send me a storm
Secret life
Secret life, send me a storm
'Cause the man I dreamt of
I see a drove him mad
Send me to the deep
I was warned once, twice
About my sacred life
Send me a storm
Because the man I love to touch
Well he don't like me so much
Send me a storm
Me so much
Send me a storm
Me so much
Send
Me so much
Send
Me so much
Send
'Cause the man I dreamt I had
Well you see I drove him mad
Sent me to the deep
'Cause the man I dreamt I had
Oh, you see, I drove him mad
Sent me to the deep
Mm, yeah, sent me to the deep
'Cause the man I dreamt I had
Well you see I drove him mad
Sent me to the deep
