I need to feel complete, complete
Your voice is so sweet, so sweet
I need to feel the same, the same
I know that we can be blamed
As I sing deeper
Feel my heart skips a beat
Will we keep this secret
As I feel my soul fleet
So when I scream, I scream your name
I shout so loud so we can claim
Our flame, our flame
Our flame, our flame
So I scream, I scream so loud
Will you hear me shout
Need to shout to your heart, I will never take part, take part, take part, take part
I need to feel complete
Your voice is so sweet
I need to feel the same
I know we can't be blamed
So I scream, I scream so loud
Will you hear me shout?
Need to shout to your heart
I will never take part
Take part, take part, take part
So I scream, I scream so loud
Will you hear me shout?
Need to shout to your heart
I will never take part
Take part, take part, take part
