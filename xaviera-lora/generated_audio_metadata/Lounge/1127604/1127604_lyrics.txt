Shabbat we take a swing
Your eyes say everything
And we don't need words
We don't need words
Shabbat we take a swing
Your eyes say everything
And we don't need words
We don't need words
Shabbat we take a swing
Your eyes say everything
And we don't need words
We don't need words
Shabbat we take a swing
And we don't need words, we don't need words
And I feel you, and I feel you
And I feel you, and I feel you, and I feel you
Sha-ba-we take a swing, your eyes say everything
And we don't need words, we don't need words
Sha-ba-we take a swing, your eyes say everything
And we don't need words, we don't need words
Sha-ba-we take a swing, your eyes say everything
And we don't need words
We don't need words
Shy but we take a swing
Your eyes say everything
And we don't need words
We don't need words
