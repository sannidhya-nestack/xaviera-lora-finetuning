No need to hide why you think
I'm listening all the time
I need someone to believe
And make me think a new way
To give me hope where I am empty
Whatever I am
Whatever I am
In times of trial
I feel so tired and so alone
But now there's a fire
In place of this ash pile inside my mind
No need to hide what you think
I'm listening all the time
I need someone to believe
And make me think a new way
To give me hope where I am empty
Where I am empty, oh, whoa
