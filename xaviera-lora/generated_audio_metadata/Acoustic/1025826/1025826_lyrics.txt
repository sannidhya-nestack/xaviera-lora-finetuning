Botticelli's Venus
Just may have floated off the canvas
Imagine my surprise
When right before my very eyes
Must be the color of her hair
I've never seen a shade so rare
And now there's no one else compares
No, no, there ain't no substitute
For red, such red, my red
It's maroon, no, no, burgundy
In this light, almost strawberry
And yes, she just noticed me
And she smiled, she just smiled
Skin, ivory, new fantasy
Red, I am so into you
Hey hey, genetic drifting chromosome
Again the stars align to bring you home
To me, to me, to me
Must be the color of her hair
I've never seen a shade so rare
And now there's no one else compares
You'll know there ain't no substitute
For red, such red, my red
It's maroon, no, no, burgundy
In this light, almost strawberry
And yes, she just noticed me
And she smiled, she just smiled
Skin, ivory and new
Fantasy red
I am so into red
I am so into red
I am so into you
