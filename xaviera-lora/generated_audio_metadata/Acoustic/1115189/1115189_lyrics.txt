I wait alone, you know that it ain't easy
I lost my soul along the way
The clouds are dark and there's no silver lining
I might never know the day
But I can't wait to see it's true
I can't wait, you know I'm so in love with you
I can't wait to see the day
When you come back to me, I know you know the way
The summer's gone, our time is left behind me
The leaves are falling around my head
If you return the letters that I sent to you
I will know your love is dead
I can't wait to see it's true
I can't wait, you know I'm so in love with you
I can't wait to see the day
When you come back to me, I know you know the way
