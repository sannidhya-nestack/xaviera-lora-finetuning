Her tune is haunting, a tune so dear
When she returns, all I want to hear
Suppose I should move on from the past
So good to remember these things that last
Not a day goes by
Stay a while sweet darling
Stay a while my friend
So that I can languish
In what might have been
Not a day goes by
Not a day goes by
I welcome the dream and all the longing
This fantasy that I belong in
Not a day goes by
Not a day goes by
Soothe this passion, ease my mind
In all my travels, it is here I find
Not a day goes by, not a day goes by
I welcome the dream and all the longing
This fantasy that I belong in
Not a day goes by
Loss restored, sorrow subsides
Not a day goes by
Not a day goes by
Ooh, ooh
