I sit here wondering where you are and what you're doing
And does this day remind you of us and of our first beginning
And the hopes and dreams that we planned the very first time we touched hands
And the remembrance of a love so sweet and new
But somehow somewhere along the way
We seem to lose our hold
On a love that we thought was meant to be
And even though quite some time has passed us
I find myself thinking about you
And I wonder are you thinking about me?
There was a time when we were so in love so deeply
That without you I thought that I couldn't breathe
I thought no one could separate us
Could or will we ever make up the way I feel for you
Could I ever love another?
I remember the purple and pink skies
And that promising look in your eyes
The way you look at me
The way you hold me
There's so much I wish that I could undo
I would not hide my love from you
I would show you a side of me that you never knew
But somehow somewhere along the way
We seem to lose our hold
On a love that we thought was meant to be
And even though quite some time has passed us
I find myself thinking about you
And I wonder are you thinking about me?
There was a time when we were so in love so deeply
That without you I thought that I couldn't breathe
I thought no one could separate us
Could or will we ever make up the way I feel for you
Could I ever love another?
The seasons of life do change and maybe things won't be the same
But I will always be grateful for all the love you gave
But somehow somewhere along the way
We seem to lose our hold
On a love that we thought was meant to be
And even though quite some time has passed us
I find myself thinking about you
And I wonder are you thinking about me?
There was a time when we were so in love so deeply
That without you I thought that I couldn't breathe
Thought no one could separate us
Could or will we ever make up the way I feel for you
Could I ever love another?
There was a time when we were so in love so deeply
That without you I thought that I couldn't breathe
Thought no one could separate us
Could or will we ever make up
The way I feel for you
Could I ever love another
Ooh, ooh, ooh
