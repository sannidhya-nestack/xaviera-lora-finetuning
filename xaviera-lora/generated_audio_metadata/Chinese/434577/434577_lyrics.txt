I'm too young to be a woman, I'm too young to be a woman
I'll be waiting for you to come back to me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you.
I'll never let you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
