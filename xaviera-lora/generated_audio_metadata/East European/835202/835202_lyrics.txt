La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
There's one lonely string sound
It is slowly dying down
I drink my share of juice
They are quite a good few
Anyway, one more time, let us taste from the wine
It is all now and here, till one day love appears
We don't live only once, better catch up the chance
Now and here in this gypsy's romance
Eyes of beauty in blue will be weep for my dues
All the days that have passed won't return back to us
Anyway, one more time, let us taste from the wine
It is all now and here, till one day love appears
We don't ever wanna leave
Better catch up the chance
Now I'm here in this gypsy's romance (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
A new sun rises up, who'll be granted with luck?
There's no way we can know, but we'll keep holding on
Anyway, one more time, let us taste from the wine
It is all now and here, till one day love appears
We don't live only once, better catch up the chance
Now and here in this gypsy's romance
