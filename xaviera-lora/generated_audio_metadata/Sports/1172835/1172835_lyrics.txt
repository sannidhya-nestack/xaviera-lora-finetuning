Peep the moves like uppercuts, hit you like one two
Or the jab jab straight to the rack like Uncle Drew
I'm setting up for three, even though we down two
I don't play for overtime, all I want is the W
Keep my L's low like 2016 Warriors
Got your crowd dead, announce a call for the coroner
My game gator like Horford and Keem Noah (ah)

Three, two, one
Taking the last shot, you can count it when it drop
Competition I see none, I'm going to the rack
And one, three, two, one
Taking the last shot, you can count it when it drop
Competition I see none
I'm going to the racks, can't win
We ballin, we ballin, we ballin, ballin, we ballin, we ballin
Ballin, we ballin, we ballin, ballin, we ballin, we ballin

Taking the last shot, you can count it when it drop
Competition I see none
I'm going to the rack, and one
My shots switch, serving like a hot dish
Point four on the release like I'm D Fish
Peace this, it's a talent you can't teach this
I'm like Steph at the line, it's rare that I miss
Every night, every game, go let's get better
I'm the quiet kinda killer, something like Kawhi Leonard
When you see me, know that you can't guard me
I'ma shoot it right over the top like KD
I'ma go screw my ring and my MVP
On my block with the Bentley SUV
Letting everybody drive it (drive it, drive it)
Everybody get a ride it (ride it, ride it)
As a champion my whole team gon' win (team)
While we hoisting up the trophy and we scream Amen (scream, scream, scream)
Thank my mama for them times she let me out to the park (out to the park)
Now every house that I purchase got a hoop in the yard like ah!
Three, two, one (three, two, one, one)
Taking the last shot, you can count it when it drop (you know what I gotta do)
Competition I see none (none, none, none, none)
Going to the racks (play rock, play rock, play rock)

Going to the rack
And one
