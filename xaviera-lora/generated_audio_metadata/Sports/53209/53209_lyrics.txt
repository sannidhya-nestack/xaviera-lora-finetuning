Katie Casey was baseball mad
Had the fever and had it bad
Just to root for the hometown crew
Every Sioux, Katie Blue
On a Saturday, her young beau
Called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show, but Miss Kate said, "No, I tell you what you can do"
Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
Why buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack
I don't care if I never get back
Let me root, root, root for the home team
If they don't win it's a shame
For it's one, two, three strikes you're out at the old ball game
Listen, there it goes, it's a home run
He's coming around the bases now, oh what a thrill
Another victory, take me out to the ball game
What memories of the years gone by
Oh when life was shorter and sweeter and the prices were lower
They really have to have a World Series machine
America, Japan, Cuba, that'll be a World Series
Take me back to the old ball game and the new one to come
For it's one, two, three strikes you're out at the old ball game
