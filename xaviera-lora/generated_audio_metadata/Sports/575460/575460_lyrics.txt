Darling I'll be trippin' on these clouds and stars and
These beautiful colors can't reach the top of the clouds and
Baby, they got me smoking like a chimney, got me getting high
Do you wanna get high? (Yeah) I said now (Yeah) do you wanna get high baby? (Yeah) I said (Yeah) do you wanna get high? (Yeah) I said now (Yeah) do you wanna get high like me?
Do you wanna get high, I said now, do you wanna get high baby, I said, do you wanna get high, I said now, do you wanna get high boy
Make a plan, make a stand, gotta get up, get in, get into it
You gotta keep away from the drugs, you do what you did to that boss
Get up little human, rise up little human
Can you help me or hit me?
Hey, what are we doing up here?
Do you wanna get high?
I said now
Do you wanna get high baby?

That's cause of that shit you're into
Don't believe in the thing called destiny, it's over, just believe in what you can be
