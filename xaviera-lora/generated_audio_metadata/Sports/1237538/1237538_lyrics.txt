Yo, listen up, we're the 49ers crew
On the field, there's nothing we can't do
From the bay to the streets, we bring the heat
In every game, we aim to defeat
Gold Rush mentality, we're on the rise
With every play, we mesmerize
From the trenches to the end zones glow
We bring the energy, let it flow
We're the 49ers and we're here safe
We're gonna win in every way
From the kickoff to the final play
In the red and gold we'll pave our way
We'll pave our way
We'll pave our way
We'll pave our way
We'll pave our way
We're Montana, the rice, a legacy untold
In every battle, we're bold and cold
Through adversity, we stand tall
With grit and determination
We give our all, on the grid, down wrong
We make our stand, with Shenandoah's playbook in hand
From Levi's Stadium to the city's heart
We'll tear apart any opponent's chart
We're Bay-B-Way
We make our stand
With Shenanigans playbook in hand
From Levi's Stadium to the city's heart
We'll tear apart any opponent's shot
We're the 49ers and we're here to say
We're gonna win in every way
From the kickoff to the final play
In the red and gold we'll pave our way
We'll pave our way
But pave our way
But pave our way
But pave our way
