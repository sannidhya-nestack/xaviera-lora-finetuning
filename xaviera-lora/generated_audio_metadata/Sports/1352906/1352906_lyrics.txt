We back, we back, runnin' it up, beat back, we ready, we ready
Stadium shaking heavy, comin' for gold steady
Rockets in my pocket, feelin' charged like a socket
The baseline's knockin', got the haters outta pocket
Pavin' poundin', sneakers screamin', never stoppin'
Crowd's a wave, I'm surfin' on it, no floppin'
Glow bright, I'm the sun in the night
Came for the throne, got the crown in my sight
They doubted the grind, now they watching the climb
Every step, every rhyme sharper than a porcupine
We back, we back, running it up, we back
We ready, we ready
Stadium shaking heavy, coming for gold steady
Heart pumping bass, adrenaline race
Dreams so big got em running outta space
Punchlines landing combos like Ali
Swinging for the fences, no plan B
Chain tight locked in feel the energy surge
Beat drop seismic whole crowd on the verge
Echoes in the rafters, sound of the laughter
Turned out as believers, the moment we captured
Every step of bolder, rolling it forward
Legacy written, no erasing the record
