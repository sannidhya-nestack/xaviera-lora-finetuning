Chasing yard lines on the light
With iron warriors fueled by flight
Feel the tremor of the ground
One more play to wear the crown
Helmet clashes like thunder's roar
Hear the clouds deafening encore
Titans clash in brutal grace
Fight for glory, art for race
Touchdown frenzy, hearts ablaze
In the madness, legends race
Run and sweat, run and sweat
Dreams collide in this battleground
No place to hide
Hollow whispers, plans to strike
Every down's a fierce strike
Hands of steel, speed of light
Play with fire, grasp it tight
Enemies stare under the glare
Victory scent fills the air
Seconds ticking, fate is close
One last push, give your most
Touchdown fantasy, hearts ablaze
In the madness, legends waste blood and sweat
Dreams collide in this battleground, no place to hide
Huddle whispers, plans to strike
Every dance of fear spike
Hands of steel, speed of light
Play with fire, grasp it tight
No place to hide
Enemies stare under the glare
Victory's edge fills the air
Seconds ticking, fate is close
One last push, give your most
Touchdown frenzy, hearts ablaze
In the madness, legends wave
Blood and sweat, dreams collide
In this battleground, no place to hide
No place to hide, no place to hide, no place to hide
