Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to run?
The fight you feel inside's become too real
It's you against you
And when it gets too much
You want to hang things up
Before it breaks you in two
But you've never been a quitter
We're born to be a winner, it's true
Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to fly?
So mount up with wings, God gave you eagles by your side
The wind in your hair, it won't slow you down
You're running so fast, your feet just barely touch the ground
Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to run?
Those second chances aren't given to everyone
You better not waste it
Your breathing's getting better, it's starting to come together again
Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to fly?
So mount up with wings God gave you
Eagles by your side
The wind in your hair
It won't slow you down
You're running so fast
Your feet just barely touch the ground
Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to fly? (You can fly)
Mount up with wings, God gave you eagles by your side (The eagles by your side)
The wind in your hair, it won't slow you down (It won't slow you down)
You're running so fast, your feet just barely touch the ground
You're running so fast, your feet just barely touch the ground
Are you ready to run? (Are you ready to run?)
Are you ready to run? (Are you ready to run?)
Are you ready to run?
Are you ready to run? (Are you ready to run?) (Are you ready to run?) (Are you ready to run?)
