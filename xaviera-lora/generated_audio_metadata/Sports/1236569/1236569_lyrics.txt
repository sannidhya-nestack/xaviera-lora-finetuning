Sparkling arena where champions rise
We're firing our souls, we aim for the skies
Every heart beats a drum, every step a roar
We'll fight'til the end, leaving it all
We're the thunder, we're the lightning, in the heat of the battle
We keep on fighting those, who'll never surrender
We're warriors of the game, forever contenders, oh
Forever contenders
We're warriors of the game, forever contenders
