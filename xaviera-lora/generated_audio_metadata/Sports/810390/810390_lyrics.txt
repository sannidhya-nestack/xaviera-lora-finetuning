Living in a small land
But dreaming big of something far more grand
Pictures on the screen
Have us dreaming
Oh and when everything goes down in flames
We will rebuild again
We travel far away
We'll make it one day
Say, we give our grace
Say, find our place
Where the ice won't break
Working hard, getting better every time
Every new person or best guides us on our climb
We may fall behind once in a while
But we're growing
With every trial
Sing, we'll give our grace
Sing, we'll find our place
Where the ice won't break
And there are ones
Who can take it
Ooh, it can't be great
Ooh, we found our place
In the ice home break
The future we'll make
