To hell with feeling normal
Comply and fall in place
These pills they push we swallow
To wash the world away
And as all the worlds collide
Prescription based them to the night
And I think you made it hard to think
With these clouds you've held me down
Down inside and we were not home
And we would know
And we would know
I think it's getting harder to make sense at all
And I saw the worlds collide prescription based
Until the night and I think
You made it hard to think
With this cloud you felt me down
Down inside
To hell with feeling normal
To hell with feeling normal
And we were numb
And we were numb
And we were numb
I think it's getting harder to make sense at all
And we were numb
And we were numb
And we were numb
I think it's getting harder to make sense at all
To how we're feeling normal
