I remember when growing up
There was something I couldn't get enough of
Sunny summer days we could hear the call
Come on everybody let's play some baseball
Slow Joe would find Bobby, I would find Fast Jack
Once we threw the first pitch, there was no turning back
From the rising of the sun to it setting getting small
We all got together to play some baseball
Worn out pillows became every base
A flat cardboard box made a great home plate
Our favorite team's hat felt ten feet tall
Didn't care who won, we had to play some baseball
Every night I would dream the same sweet dream
To wear the uniform of a major league team
From the first day of spring till the last day of fall
We all got together to play some baseball
Worn out pillows became every base
A flat cardboard box made a great home plate
One favorite team's hat felt ten feet tall
Didn't care who won we had to play some baseball
From the first day of spring'til the last day of fall
We all got together to play some baseball
The greatest childhood memories that I recall
Were me and my buddy playing baseball
