You know, it's only when I'm down on my knees
And I feel hopeless, that's when I decide to ask for help
But then I looked up, and there was nobody there
And that's when I realized, it was always me versus me
I was the only one capable of helping me
I fight with the purpose, I choose to be brave when I'm nervous
Yeah they came for the king, I prepare for the scene when they pull on the curtains
Even though they laughed, I stayed on my path and I ran like it's urgent
I step in the ring, my destiny rings then the real me emerges
I been the writer, I been the fighter, pulling on idas
I right my wrongs, I pray for my sins, I ain't feeling too righteous now
Now I got the mightiest touch and if you think it must be luck then you're insane
I'm in love with the blood and the sweat
They just lost for the fame
Oh, oh, oh, welcome to the show
They know I will never fall
I will be the greatest story ever told
So me rider let'em know, let'em know
I've been searching for answers
The conviction to fight this addiction
Manifesting all my predictions
Through the pain I found liberation
I see no limitation on the path that I'm paving
The surface is breaking
I've been success in the making
I knew some of my friends couldn't take it
It's a shame though
You gotta go this ain't no game boy
I ain't hateful
If you had my back I'm grateful
If you stabbed my back I'm grateful
Better take my shots better lay low
Know that I'm coming for the title
And I'm ready to fight till my last breath
There's no telling how far that I might go
And I'm fighting to inspire all my people
And in my daughter's eyes I hope to be a hero
I know what it's like to have to start from zero
I just put the work in and I pray that God will move the needle
Tell me can you hear me up there?
Tell me can you feel me?
Thanks for the gift and the curse that you gave me
Everybody feels me
I used to be empty
Now I'm full of wisdom
I know that I'm worthy
To the ones that stand in my way
I'll show you the mercy
I'll show you the mercy
Woah woah woah
Welcome to the show
They know woah woah woah
I will never fold
I will be the greatest story ever told
Sold me right, I'll let'em know, let'em know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, welcome to the show
They know, whoa, whoa, I will never fall
I will be the greatest story ever told
So me writer let'em know, let'em know
