Hustle ain't cheap, it is worth every penny (penny)
No time to sleep'cause I got dreams by the many (many)
My stars shine bright like the ones near them satellites
Like wind catchin' a kite, watch me take flight (ayy)
I'm in the zone (zone), I'm bringin' it home (home)
Look at the trophy, I'm takin' it home (home)
I'm bringin' my best (best), we'll settle for less
Catching the vibes like a neck wire pounding my chest
I'm bringing the fire down to the wire
Energy's flowing let's take it up higher
I'm full of motion let's put it in motion
It sounds like a riot let's call the commotion
Can you feel the way
Can you feel the way
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
Can you feel the way?
Can you feel the way?
I'm in my zone
Get in the zone
Get in the zone
Get in the zone, yes
Get in the zone, get in the zone
Get in the zone, I'm in my zone
Get in the zone, I'm in my zone
Get in the zone
I'm in the zone, I'm bringing it home
Look at my rivals, nobody's home
I'm bringing my best, pounding my chest
Rolling'em up, roll'em up until nobody's left
Level up higher, it's down to the wire
Adrenaline's burning, you're playing with fire
I'm full of emotion, let's put it in motion
It sounds like a riot, let's cause a commotion
Can you feel the way?
Can you feel the way?
I make my zone, I make my zone
Can you feel the way?
Can you feel the way
I'm in my zone
Get in the zone
Get in my zone
Get in the zone
Yes!
Can't get in the zone
Get in the zone
Get in the zone, I'm in my zone
Get in the zone, I'm in my zone
Get in the zone, can you feel the wave?
Can you feel the wave?
I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone
Can you feel the way?
Can you feel the way?
I'm in my zone
Get in the zone
