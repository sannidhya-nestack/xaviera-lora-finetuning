Hot dog! Hot dog! Right here, give me your hot dog, right here
Batter up, batter up
Batter up, batter up
Swing, batter swing
Now if you're talkin'bout perfection
In God's whole universe
You're talkin'bout the distance
Between home plate and first
And what is more majestic
Than a fly ball deep to right?
Headin' for the heavens
Disappearing in the night
I'm crazy'bout baseball (batter up, batter up)
Crazy'bout baseball (batter up, batter up)
Crazy'bout baseball (swing, batter, swing)
Time to snuff that rally with some diamond dirt ballet
The flip, the pivot, the trot of foist
Bang bang it's a double play
Lefty checks the man on third
The batter squares to bunt
He lays it on the line and squeezes in left when it run
I'm crazy'bout baseball (batter up, batter up)
Crazy'bout baseball (batter up, batter up, batter up)
Crazy'bout baseball (I'm about to sway)
Two tickets for the bleachers, mister please (oh, mister please)
Way back this game is history
I'm gonna oil up my mitt, stick in a ball and wrap it good
Smack one on the sweet spot, you can smell the burning wood
I got a Maris in my pocket and a mantle in my crown
I'm swinging for that short porch on my way to Cooperstown
I'm crazy'bout baseball (ladder up, ladder up)
Crazy'bout baseball (ladder up, ladder up, ladder up)
Crazy'bout baseball (swing ladder swing)
I'm crazy'bout baseball (battin' up, battin' up)
Crazy'bout baseball (battin' up, battin' up)
Crazy'bout baseball (quick, fast, quick)
I'm crazy'bout baseball (battin', up, battin', up)
Crazy'bout baseball (battin', up, battin', up)
Crazy'bout baseball (quick, fast, quick)
I'm crazy'bout baseball (battin', up, battin', up)
Crazy'bout baseball (battin', up, battin', up)
Crazy'bout baseball (quick, fast, quick)
I'm crazy'bout baseball, crazy'bout baseball, crazy'bout baseball
I'm nuts about baseball, sweet and sweet
