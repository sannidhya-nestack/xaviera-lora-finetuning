We're gonna lose our blues on the 15th green
that's where the hippest people meet
We'll gain a few strokes and we'll get that hoe
We're gonna party off, let's go to the 15th green
15th green, green
15, 15th green
Everybody wants to be seen on the 15th green
Just put put up to the standard trap
Bring your clubs and your hand a cap
The birdies and the Eagles swinging on the stars
Beat MacCady to the party
Fifteenth green, fifteenth green
Green fifteen, fifteenth green
Everybody wants to be a saint on the fifteenth green
Oh let's go
And if it gets a little rough (gets a little rough)
Then we can iron it out (iron it out)
We're two under the sun (under the sun)
Kiss'em while we listen to the gallery shout
Four, three, two, one
And if it looks to the 15th green
15th green
Green 15
15th green
Everybody wants to be seen on the 15th green
We don't keep score but we always do
Bring a little more of that mullet and stew
Come on the big bertha and give it a ride
If you got a good line you can swing all night
On the 15th green
The 15th green
Green 15
15th green
Everybody wants to get seen on the 15th green
To the 15th green
The 15th green
Green 15, 15th green
Everybody wants to be seen on the 15th green
Everybody wants to be seen on the 15th green
Everybody wants to be seen on the 15th green
