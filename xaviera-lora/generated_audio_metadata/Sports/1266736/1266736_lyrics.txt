Red and white we stand for the team we all adore
Singing loud and proud, we'll be here forevermore
From Highbury to Emirates the spirit stays the same
With Gunners in our hearts, we feel a known shame
Our legacy is strong, with history we reign
Together as one, we'll conquer every game
Arsenal, Arsenal
We cheer for you, stand tall
Arsenal, Arsenal
In love with the cannonball
North London forever, we hold our heads up high
With every goal you score, we're reaching for the sky
Invincible as we were, and strongly remain
In red and white, we'll march on through the rain
Come what may, in victory or pain
We'll stand by you, every match the same
Arsenal, Arsenal
We cheer for you, stand tall
Arsenal, Arsenal
In love with the cannonball
From young to old
Our spirit never dies
Singing to the end
Under London's stars
Together we will fight
Lifting every cheer
Arsenal, our love
Forever sincere
Arsenal, Arsenal
We cheer for you, Santos
Arsenal, Arsenal
In love with the cannonballs
