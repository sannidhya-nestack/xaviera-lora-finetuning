It's me out in the hall, baby, it's me out in the hall
My lips are sealed and they're fragile, daddy
I don't care if I never get my drink
Prepare the boat in case they come back and stay
For it's fun to be friends around and be home again
May we take you a great tall man
Had the fever and had it bad
Jumped through the door, the hall
Jumped through every clue
May we do
All your standards may wear your glow
All to see is we fight to show
To be a show but you may get low
I'll tell you what you can do
Reach the outskirts of all day
Reach the outskirts of love
Hide in containers with hand-held bags
I don't care if I never get back there
The fruits of our whole being
They say don't finish the day
For it's one, two, three times better than three whole small days
Daisy, Daisy saw all the game
Healed the flame, my death was made
Holy on fire, he was warm, oh my love
Good and strong
Then the storm was left to do, to do
Daisy, Daisy knew what to do
Just to cheer up the boy she knew
He played the next thing he saw
Take me out to the ball game
Take me out with the crowd
I need some demons with hands of magic
I don't care if my head is hatched
Look, look for the ball game
They must say it's a stage
For it's one, two, three fights now
Out at the ball game
We are proud to be home, home
