Do you see the glint, the glimmer of gold
Do you see it now, reach out for the sky
Do you hear the crowds cheering loud for you
Do you hear it now, reach out for the sky
Sing aloud, soaring higher and higher
You're
You're the star shining brighter and brighter
Every step, every breath, every leap, you're the best
Every move, every dive, every throw, beat the rest
Sing aloud, soaring higher and higher
You're the star shining brighter and brighter
Every step, every breath, every leap, you're the best
Every move, every dive, every throw, beat the rest
Do you feel the heat, rising from the track
Do you feel it now, burning as you raise your head
Do you feel the beat, of a billion hearts
Beating just for you, you're their superstar
Sing aloud, soaring higher and higher
You're
You're the star shining brighter and brighter
Every step, every breath, every leap you're the best
Every move, every dive, every throw beat the rest
Single out soaring higher and higher
You're the star shining brighter and brighter
Every step, every breath, every leap you're the best
Every move, every dive, every throw beat the rest
