Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through the falling mist
I search for you, your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two words, we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our name
Love like fire yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you though lifetimes pass by
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, fairy, give me, give me
You are my silence
My endless light
Even in darkness
Darkness, you shine so bright
