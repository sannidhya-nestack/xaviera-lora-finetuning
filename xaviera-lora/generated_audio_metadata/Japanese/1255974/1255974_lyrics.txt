Underneath the Tokyo sky
Your eyes meet mine, oh sunshine
In the crowded city noise
Our silence speaks, it never lies
It keeps passing me on by
A lost storm, it takes my mind
We'll dance around the stars, leap in the moon's white light
We're painting with the colors of love, under the clouds high above
Each heartbeat a melody, a seamless romantic dawn
In the midst of sakura bloom, our feelings start to bloom
Capturing timeless moments in love, who else we can run?
Our dreams grow with reality
Our shadows play with spontaneity
Shooting stars showering down
Witnessed by the city's tranquility
In the hidden whispers
Our love story trends towards stars
Living long as sweet as candy
Every moment of ours
Was playing to my symphony
In the city of endless melody
In the rhythm of city lights
In the heart of Tokyo city
Under the soft glowing lanterns
In the city that never yearns
With a mouth as sweet as candy
Every moment of ours
We're swaying to the symphony
In the city of endless melody
In the rhythm of city lights
In the heart of Tokyo city
Under the soft glowing lanterns
In the city that never yearns
Our hearts beat in harmony
As the world truly turns
Through the streets of Tokyo night
Love echoes, oh what a sight
Underneath the glowing city lights
Our hearts hold each other tight
In our decks of dreams and more
Under the moons of glow above
I told you love
Echoed by the cooling of the dawn
