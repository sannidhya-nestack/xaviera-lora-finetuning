Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through the falling mist
I search for you
Your shadow lingers like a fish
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our name
Love like fire yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky I vow to you
I'll find you the lifetimes passed by
You are my silence, my endless life
Even in darkness you shine so bright
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
