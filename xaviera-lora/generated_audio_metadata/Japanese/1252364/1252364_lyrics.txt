Under the bright city lights, we find our dreams tonight
Dancing in the fading moonlight, hoping to ignite
Mostly when we are alone, we are asleep and slow
Whispers of love, we know they're all out this door
As the stars collide, through the city lights
Let's try to stand inside their souls of light
Through the crowded streets, our descending speech
A symphony of beats in this night's heartbeat
Together we'll soar, finding more and more
Beyond every door, one life as a soar
Let's leave behind our fears, air and praise, cheers
Through the cold we years, treasure these moments, tears
Under the bright singing lights, we'll find our dreams tonight
In this perfect sight, shining ever so bright
Under the bright city lights
We'll find our dreams tonight
Dancing in the fading gloom
I don't mean to late night
Listen to me, oh I know
Where our secrets glow
This place of love we know
That our hearts are slow
As the stars collide
Look what the city's had
Let's try to stand aside
Where our souls align
As the stars collide, with the city's height, let's shine this endless light, their souls abide
As the stars collide, with the city's height let's shine this endless light, their souls abide
As the stars collide, with the city's height let's shine this endless light, their souls abide
As the stars collide, whip at the city's side
Let's try this in the sky, where souls abide
As the stars collide, whip at the city's side
Let's try this in the sky, where souls abide
