Raindrops follow gentle dance on windows glass of fleeting trance
Your voice calls from beyond like a siren song so fond
With every step you take my heart begins to break
Shadows stretch across the ground
Echoing a haunting sound
Lost within this labyrinth
Where love and pain are intertwined
I'll chase your shadow through the fog
Until the end of time
Even if the world should end
And the stars no longer shine
The echoes of the rain
Our love forever will remain
Raindrops fall, a gentle dance
On windowless glass, a fleeting trance
Your voice calls from beyond
Like a siren song, so fond
With every step you take my heart begins to break
Shadows stretch across the ground
Echoing the haunting sounds
Lost within this labyrinth where love and love and pain are intertwined
I'll chase your shadow through the fog until the end of time
Even if the world should end and the stars no longer shine
In the echoes of the rain our love forever will mend
Even if the world should end and the stars no longer shine
And the echoes of the rain, our love forever will remain
Even if the world should end and the stars no longer shine
In the echoes of the rain, our love forever will remain
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Raindrops fall, a gentle dance
Among those glass, a fleeting trance
Your voice calls from beyond
Like a siren song, so fond
