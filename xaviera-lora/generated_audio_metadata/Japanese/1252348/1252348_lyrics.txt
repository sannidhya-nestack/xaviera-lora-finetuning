In a city full of pipes
Under the cherry blossoms
We laugh and dance and love so awesome
Dreams intertwine in the warmth of night
Forever by your side everything's alright
Our heart beat as one, in synchrony
You're my melody, my harmony
Through the storms and rain we'll find our sun
Our journey has only just begun
The stars above us whisper soft and low
Our love will always grow, wherever we go
Hand in hand we'll face tomorrow
With you there's no sorrow
I'll leave my future to follow
In the city far, red lights
Under the cherry blossoms
We laugh and dance and laugh so awesome
Dreams in the twilight in a wonderful night
Forever by your side everything's alright
Our heart's beat is one, in synchrony
You're my melody, my harmony
Through the storms and rain we'll find our sun
Our journey has only just begun
The stars above us whisper soft and low
Our love will always grow, wherever we go
Hand in hand we'll face tomorrow, with you there's no sorrow
In a city far, bed lights, under the cherry blossoms
We're laughing things that are so awesome, dreams in a twilight
In a warmth of light, forever by your side and everything's alright
