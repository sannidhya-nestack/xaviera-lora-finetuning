Tokyo lights, shimmering bright, setting our hearts alight
Underneath the star-studded sky, caught in the thrill of the night
Your gaze meets mine, silent words intertwine
In the glow of the city's embrace, feeling so divine
Dancing through the rhythm of love
In a city that never sleeps
Every happy thing's a melody
A secret that all love keeps
Under the cherry blossom trees
In the soft moonlight breeze
Crafty moments of magic
Lost in time's endless seas
In the dazzling cityscape
Love takes a wondrous shape
Wishes whisper on the wind
A love story we can't escape
With a gentle smile
You sweep away my trials
In this enchanted Tokyo night
Love beautifully defiles
Swirling in the symphony of stars
Under the moon's gentle bars
Lights that glow on the Tokyo streets
Capturing our memories
On the dimples they instantly glow
Feelings begin to overflow
Our hearts resonate to the rhythm
Setting the night aglow
As the dawn of sage is the night
Reflecting our joyous plight
Across the Tokyo horizon
Our love shines so bright
Each enchanting moment spent
In every glance that's lent
Our Tokyo tale of love is our everlasting sentiment
