Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Through the falling mist I search for you
Your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper of a night
Love like fire, never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
You are my silence, my endless light
Even in darkness, you shine so bright
Flowers always fall, but they are the wind
