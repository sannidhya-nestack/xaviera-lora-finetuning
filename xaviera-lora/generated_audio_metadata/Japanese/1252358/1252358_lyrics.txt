In a glimmer, in the city lights, our dreams were spun
You and I would always meet, nights were never done
Holding on to promises that fade like moon and sun
Dancing through the neon glow until we were one
We were young, we were free in our Tokyo fantasy
Hearts entwined amidst the love of our endless plea
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
In the glimmering city lights where dreams were spun
You and I would always meet, nights were never done
Holding on to promises that fade like morning sun
Dancing through the neon glow until we were one
We were young, we were free in our video fantasy
Hearts entwined and made from love our endless plea
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
In the glimmering city lights where dreams were spun
You and I would always meet, nights were never done
Holding on to promises that fade like morning sun
Dancing through the neon glow until we were one
We were young, we were free in our Tokyo fantasy (fantasy)
Hearts entwined and live in love our endless dream (ooh)
