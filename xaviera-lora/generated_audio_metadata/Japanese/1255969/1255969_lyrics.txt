Beneath Tokyo's skyline, dreaming in the neon light
Each heartbeat echoes through the city's endless night
Between the whispers of the cherry blossoms taking flight
Our story begins in this captivating sight
Across the distance where the stars align
In the land of rising sun, your hand in mine
Together we dance, lost in time
In the rhythm of love, a melody divine
Each greeting, each tender goodbye
A collage of moments under the sapphire sky
Through a technicolor journey we let our dreams fly
On the wings of hope we soar high
In the intricacies of day and time
Embracing the day in the sun's warm shine
Doing the melody, the rhythm and rhyme
In the symphony of love, your heart next to mine
In the intricate dance of fate and time
Embracing the day in the sun's warm shine
Caught in the melody, the rhythm and rhyme
In the symphony of love, your heart next to mine
In the city's heart where dreams unfurl
In the dance of coy in the water's swirl
In the echo of time
In the pearls of the world
Our love story beautifully unfurled
Beyond dreams and realities pervade our sight
In the endless thoughts
In the soft moonlight
In the canvas of love
Painted in the infinite night
We find ourselves in the city's gentle night
