Under the cherry blossom tree
We first met a fleeting glance, our hearts set
Shadow was black then, they turned to night
Whispers in the wind, everything felt right
We danced in fields of gold
Our love, a story yet untold
You are the moon, I am the tide
Together forever, side by side
Love is a melody, a song made of two
No matter the distance, we'll see it through
Beams woven in twilight under the stars
Forever in my arms wherever you are
Under the cherry blossom tree
We first met a fleeting glimpse, our hearts said
Shadows lift and they turn the night
The spurs in the wind, everything felt right
We danced a field to gold
Our love, a story untold
You are the moon, I am the tide
Together forever, side by side
Love is a melody, a song made of two
No matter the distance, we'll see it through
Kings woven in twilight, under the stars
Forever in my arms, wherever you are
You are the moon, I am the time
Together forever, side by side
Love is a memory, the song made to
Love is in the distance, we'll see it through
Dream folded and tried by under stars
Forever in my arms, wherever you are
A bird in my heart, a moon star
Forever in my arms, wherever you are
