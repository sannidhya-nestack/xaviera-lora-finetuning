Under cherry blossoms we met
A moment etched we won't et
Whispering secrets by the stream
Living life sharing a dream
Petals float as we sing
In the springtime everything
Forever young our hearts align
In this season so divine
Paths we walked, hands entwined
Leaving all our fears behind
Every sunset, every dawn
With you my love goes on and on
With you my love goes on and on
Under cherry blossoms we met
A moment etched we won't et
Whispering secrets by the stream
Living life sharing a dream
At our sunset every dawn
With you my love goes on and on
Every sunset, every dawn
With you my love goes on and on
With you my love goes on and on
And it's every blossoms we met
A moment as we won't et
Whispering secrets like a dream
Burning like sugar in a dream
With you my love goes on and on
With you my love goes on and on
As the sun sets, as the sea
In the springtime everything
For every hunger hearts alive
In the season so divine
For every hunger hearts alive
The season so divine
