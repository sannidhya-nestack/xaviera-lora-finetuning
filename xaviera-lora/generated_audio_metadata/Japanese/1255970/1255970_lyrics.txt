In the land of the sharing of blossoms under the bright sun
Let's play and sing, hand in hand we run
With dreams in our pockets and smiles on our face
We'll paint the world with joy, with friends in every place
Japan, Japan, land of fun
Underneath the rising sun
Dance and laugh, let's have a race
In this magical wonderful blue place
We believe in rainbows and in tales of old
In the land of Jacob where stories are told
As the day turns to night, under the stars I shingle paint
The world of joy, we're friends in every place
Japan, Japan, land of fun
Underneath the rising sun
Dance and laugh, let's have a race
In this magical, wonderful place
We believe in rainbows and in tales of old
In the land of J-pop where stories are told
As the day turns to night under the starry sheen
We'll wish upon a shooting star for dreams yet unseen
Japan, Japan, land so bright, glowing in the soft moonlight
Gather'round, peace and grace in this magical wonderful place
So let's hold hands together under the sky so blue
In the land of J-pop where dreams come true
Sing this song, let's play and dance
In Japan we find joy, love and a chance
Hold up, Japan, Japan, we love you so
With our hearts we'll never let go
Hand in hand, a fond embrace
In this magical, wonderful place
In this magical, wonderful place
Let's sing and dance, fill up the space
Japan, Japan, with love we trace
Our dreams in this magical place
In this magical, wonderful place
Let's sing and dance, fill up the space
Japan, Japan, with love we trace
Our dreams in this magical place
