Shadows of the past echoing through my mind
Where your light dispels the darkness, love so kind
We traverse this journey through valleys and peaks
Your voice is the melody that my heart seeks
Together we conquer, no storm can break us down
In your smile, I find peace and never drown
In the tapestry of love, feel the thread so bright
Wrapped in your embrace, I feel so high
Shadows of the past echoing through my mind
But your light dispels the darkness, love so kind
We traverse this journey through valleys and peaks
Your voice is the melody that my heart seeks
Together we conquer, no storm can break us down
In your smile, I find peace, I never drown
In the tapestry of life, feel the breath so tight
Wrapped in your embrace, I feel so high
Your smile has found me some very true
The tapestry of life
You look so bright
What's the wrong place to feel so right?
Shadows of the past echoing through my mind
But your light spells the darkness, love so kind
We traverse this journey through valleys and peaks
Your voice is the melody that my heart seeks
Together we conquer, no storm can break us down
In your smile I find peace, I never drown
In the tapestry of life, you're the thread so bright
Wrapped in your embrace I feel so alive
But I feel so right
Watching your embrace, I feel so right
You're smiling like I'm the sun that will drown
In the tapestry of life
Feel the threat so bright
Watching your embrace, I feel so right
