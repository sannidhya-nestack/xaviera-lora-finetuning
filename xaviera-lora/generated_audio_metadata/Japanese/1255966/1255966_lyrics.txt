In the land so far away, the golden sun
Little birds bring the song, singing my love to God
We join hands, we dance and sing
In the land of Jay Park, joy is the king
In the land so far away, the sun always rise
Little birds wake us up
Singing under the skies
We join hands
We dance and sing
In the wombland of J-pop
Joy is the king
Under the cherry blossoms
We play a lot
Sweet cotton candy
Digging the fortune house
We jump high
We fly like wings
In the land of Jacob
Happiness springs every day
Here's a new story to tell
In your heart Jacob will always dwell
We join hands, we dance and sing
In the land of J-pop
Joy is the king under the cherry blossoms
We play and laugh, sweet carpe diem
Our first two hearts
Wu-Tang high, we fly like winds
In the land of J-pop, happiness springs
Every day is a new story to tell
In our heart, J-pop will always dwell
