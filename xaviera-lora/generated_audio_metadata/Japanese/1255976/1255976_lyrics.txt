Anemone, the daily blossomed in the city light
Walking with you hand in hand feels so bright
Whispered compositions in the cool night air
Just me and you, living without a care
Let our hearts sing in the rhythm of our dreams
In the city of neons and irresistible themes
We dance, we laugh, we love what we gleam
In this vibrant life we're the unbeatable team
Beneath the glowing skyline under the stars
We're creating our story in these timeless memoirs
Casting love like spells in a gentle glow
We paint our desires in a shadowy tableau
Beneath the glowing skyline under the stars
We're creating our story in these timeless memoirs
Casting love like spells in a gentle glow
We paint our desires in a shadowy tableau
Let our hearts sing in the rhythm of our dreams
In this city of neons and irresistible themes
Ooh we dance, we laugh, we love, oh we gleam
In this vibrant life, we're the unbeatable team
Underneath the cherry blossoms in the city light
We share a whisper of love holding each other tight
Underneath the Tokyo sky with dreams of light
Just me and you, living our J-pop night
