Cherry blossoms fall, painting the streets pink
In the gentle spring breeze, our lives in sync
With every fleeting petal, our spirits link
The city hums our love song while we blink
As day turns to night, our hearts interlink
Under cherry trees, our feelings finally sink
Ooh, that love
Without me feeling feelings finally slink
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Our love will end the mood, ooh, ooh, ooh
The very course tonight
Our hearts interlink
Under cherry trees
Our feelings finally sink
Oh, we'll stay right there all night long
And in the streets pink
In the gentle spring breeze
Our lives ensing
With serenity in pale
Our spirits slink
The city hums our love song while we blink
As day turns to night, our hearts interlink
Under cherry trees, our feelings finally sink (ooh, ooh)
Woah-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
With every forest and night, our hearts seem to link
Under cherry trees, our feelings finally sink
Oh, with every plant and moon, painting the streets pink
In the gentle spring breeze, our lives seem to sync
With every fleeting hello, our spirits cling
The city harms our love, so now we blink
Ooh, the stage turns to night, our hearts into lake
Under cherry trees, our feelings finally sink
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, where we're clues to tonight, our hearts into lake
Under cherry trees, our feelings finally sink
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The way we float is so inviting
Our hearts seem to link
Under cherry trees
Our feelings finally sink
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're family for our stories for
Painting the streets
(Painting)
In the dance of our dreams
Our lives insane
With every fleeting petal
Our spirits lit
This getting hung's our love song while we breathe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby, hold on, let's go while we're green
