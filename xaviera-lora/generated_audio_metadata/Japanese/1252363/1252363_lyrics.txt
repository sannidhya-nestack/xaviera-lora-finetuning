ファクソンのワンワン
赤サラダタイム
Dreams of useless only fade away
Waiting but how'd you stay?
Forever in a secret place
Shadows of regret
Trying to et
Every word unsaid
Rhythm in my head
But hope still remains
In the midnight rains
Washing away the pain
With every drop a new beginning
Though it's hard to cope
I'll find the way of hope in the whispers of the night
Love will find the light
Wished back to the night
Something along the line
Buckles of a time when you were mine
Dreams of yesterday slowly fade away
But in my heart you'll stay
Forever in a secret place
Shadows of regret trying to et
In your life trying to et
Shadows of regret tied on silver thread
Shadows of regret
Try not to et
So I fell the night in the midnight rains
But hope still remains in the midnight rains
Washing away the pain
With every drop a new beginning
Though it's hard to cope
I'll find that way of hope
In the whispers of the night
Love will find the light
