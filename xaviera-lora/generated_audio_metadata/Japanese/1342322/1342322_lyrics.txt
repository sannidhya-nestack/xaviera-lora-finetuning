Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Beautiful
I search for you, your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two worlds, we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our names
Love like fire, yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
You are my silence, my endless light
Even in darkness, you shine so bright
Flowers always fall, but there is wind
