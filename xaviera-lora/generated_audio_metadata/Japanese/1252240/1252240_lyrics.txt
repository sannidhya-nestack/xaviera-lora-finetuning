The waves crash down along the shore, a candle breathes and our spirits soar
The ocean's on and the night it's ours, with every wave our love untied
Can't end as you want us end
Our hearts beat together like a marching band
The stars above, they shine so clear
In every moment, you're always near
Love transcends both time and space
In your eyes, I found my place
No matter the storm, the tide, the sea
Together forever, you and me
The waves crash down on the moonlit shore
The gentle breeze, our spirits soar
The ocean's song in the night it sighs
With every wave, our love unties
Hand in hand as we walk the sand
Our hearts beat together like a marching band
The stars above, they shine so clear
In every moment, you're always near
Love transcends both time and space
In your eyes, I found my place
No matter the storm, the tide, the sea
Together forever, you and me
You're all I need, I know
The waves crash down a moonlit shore
A gentle breeze, our spirits soar
The ocean song in the night it sighs
With every wave our love unties
Hand in hand as we walk the sand
Our hearts beat together like a marching band
The stars above, they shine so clear
In every moment you're always near
Love transcends both time and space
I've seen you rise, seen you rise, lost all my place
No matter the storm, the tide, the sea, together forever
You and me, for me
You and me, forever
