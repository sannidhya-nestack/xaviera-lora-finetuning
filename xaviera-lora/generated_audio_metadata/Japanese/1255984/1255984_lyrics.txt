The need to kick it off the line with the neon beams
In a city that never sleeps where we chase our dreams
Hand in hand on these busy streets life is as it seems
We're sailing through it like the river streams
With the stars as our guide far and high
In the land of the rising sun
Where our hearts lie entwined in a dance
Under the brightly lit sky
In the rhythm of our hearts
On love we rely
Laughter and goodbyes
Echoed in night time
Where dreams take flight
And spirits fly
In the spectrum of life
Where love is the tie
We color our world
We don't need to try
Where the sun warms our hearts
In this splendid scene
Where we each beat of our hearts
Both convinced
Joined by a melody
Ever so serene
In this dance of love
We are the routine
For the sun warms our hearts in this splendid scene
Where with each beat of our hearts love convicts
Joined by a melody
Ever so serene in this dance of life
We are the routine
Through the bustling crowds among the city's noise
In the precious moments that life enjoys
Through the bells' rings
The enduring voice in the tale of us
Love rejoices in the city's rhythm
Under the twinkling twilight
In the melodies of love
In the calm of night
With our hearts in sync
And the stars so bright
We once were ever in love's endless flight
