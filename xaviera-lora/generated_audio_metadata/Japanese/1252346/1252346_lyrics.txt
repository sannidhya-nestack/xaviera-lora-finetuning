The ocean waves kiss the shore
With you, I need nothing more
The sunset paints the sky red
As we leave our fears unsaid
Walking through the sands of time
Feeling your hand in mine
Each heartbeat a precious sound
Knowing we'd finally found
A love that is true and bright
Shining through the darkest night
Our shadows dance in the twilight
Everything feels just right
Whispers of the ocean breeze
Bring us down to our knees
Promises of endless love
Beneath the stars above
Your smile is my guiding light
Through the dark you're my knight
Forever by your side
Oh by the tide of life
Hearts open wide
Do you want me for the sense of it?
I'll bring money, fine, let's flee
How I'ma find the ride, the time
Or ride the tide of life
Hearts open wide
Whispers of the ocean breeze bring us down to our knees
Promises of endless love we meet the stars above
Your smile is like guiding light through the dark you're my knight
Forever by your side we'll ride the tide of life
Hearts open wide
