Autumn leaf, thrown in game
Painting colors in this town
Through the corridors of time
Your hand in mine, feels so fine
Muslin leaves, a laughter clear
Knowing the end is near
Each goodbye, a silent tear
But memories will hold dear
Winding paths and gentle streams
You and I, against the trees
Seasons shift and times change
But our love will always range
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Autumn leaves are falling down
Painting colours in this town
Through the corridors of time
Your hand in mine feels so fine
Rustle leaves, a laughter clear
Knowing the end is near
Each goodbye, a silent tear
But memories will hold dear
Winding paths and gentle streams
You and I against the trees
Seasons shift and times change
But our love will always range
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, blending paths and gentle streams
You and I against the dreams
Seasons shift and times change
But our love will always range
Seasons shift and times change
But our love will always range
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
