Wandering through the silent night where all I can see is dark, you are in sight
Moonlight paints the scene in white, your pictures ot your light
Stars align, your love is mine
A promise written in the stars
Across the sky, together we fly
Embracing everything we are
From dusk to dawn, our love lives on
In every song, our hearts align
Wandering through the silent night
Where our whispers take their flight
And my pain's the scene in white
Your gaze turns the dark to light
Your gaze turns the dark to light
Stars align, to light
Wandering through the silent night
Where our whispers take their flight
And my pain's the scene in white
Your gaze turns the dark to light
Stars align, your love is mine
A promise written in the stars
Across the sky, together we fly
Embracing everything we are
From dusk till dawn
Our love lives on
In every song
Our hearts align
From dusk to dawn, all our love lives on in every song
Our hearts align
Wandering through the sun and night where our wishes take their flight
And moonlight paints the sea in white, the orchestra's a talk to life
Stars aligned, through love is mine, a promise written in the stars
Across the sky, together we fly
Embracing everything we are
From dusk till dawn, our love lives on
In every song, our hearts align
Wandering through the silent night
Where all those birds take their flight
Moonlight paints the scene in white
Orchestras are taught to whine
Stars align, new love is mine
A promise written in the stars
Wandering through the silent night where all the screws take their flight
Moonlight paints the scene in white, your gaze turns the dark to light
