No more future shining bright, in the deep black dark, where we'll find the light, and never feel down, let's chase the morning light
Through the streets I'll never sleep, no more future shining bright, I know something, together we will rise, reaching for the skies, no need for goodbyes
We will go to the streets the morning light
To the streets that never sleep, our future shining bright
Our love's so deep, together we will rise
Reaching for the skies, no need for goodbyes
Moonlights are shining bright in this sleepless town
With you by my side, I never feel down
Let's chase the morning light through the streets that never sleep
Our future's shining bright, our love's so deep
Together we will rise, reaching for the skies
No need for goodbyes, no need for goodbyes
Reaching for the skies, no need for goodbyes
