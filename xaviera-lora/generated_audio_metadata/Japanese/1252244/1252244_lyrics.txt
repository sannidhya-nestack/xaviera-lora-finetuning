It's time to fall and raise our color in the sky
We'll keep recalling underneath the neon lights we fly
Hearts are racing shadows chasing all the while your hand in mine
We'll write our story in the sky
Through the city streets we'll find our beats
With every pulse our souls align
Together we'll shine so bright at night
This is our time forever intertwined
Through the city streets we'll find our beats
With every pulse our souls align
Together we'll shine so bright it might
This is our time forever intertwined
Through the city streets we'll find our beats
With every pulse our souls align
Together we'll shine so bright, ignite
This is our time, forever intertwined
This is our time, forever intertwined
