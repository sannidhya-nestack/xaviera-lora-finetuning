Lost in the summer haze, golden hours and endless days
Waves kiss the shore we explore, our spirits wild wanting more
Sunsets paint the sky with fire
Igniting every deep desire
With the breeze, hearts at ease
Let's cherish every little piece
Holding your hand so tight with you
I see the lights in the woods under the moon
Dancing to the night soon
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Holdin' your hand so tight
With you I see the light
Silhouettes under the moon, dancing'til the night's soon
Holding your hand so tight with you, I see the light soon
Silhouettes under the moon, dancing'til the night's soon
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lost in the summer haze
Golden hours, endless days
Waves kiss the shore we explore
Our spirits wild, wanting more
Suns just paint the sky with fire
Igniting every deep desire
With the breeze, hearts at ease
Let's cherish every little piece
Holding your hand so tight with you
I see the light
Silhouettes under the moon
Dancing'til the night's doomed
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I see the light
Silhouettes under the moon
Dancing'til the night's doomed
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh
