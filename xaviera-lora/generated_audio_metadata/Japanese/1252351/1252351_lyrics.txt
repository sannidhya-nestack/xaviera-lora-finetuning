In the street, through the shades of grey
We wander in the city night
My head in your shoulders, that's two
Shaving it all was so new
Cherry blossoms fall in the breeze
We find solace under the trees
Your laughter echoes in my ears
Washing away all my fears
The neon lights are guiding stars
Taking us to places afar
Where the future sparkles clear whenever you are near
Let's dance'til the dawn breaks at night
Holding on to each other tight
Whispers shared in the midnight glow
Promising we'll never let go
Memories etched in our minds
Heartbeats in perfect time
This journey just begun
Two hearts beating as one
In the streetlights, the shades so bright
We wander in the city night
My hand in yours just as two
Dreaming in a world so new
Cherry blossoms fall in the breeze
We find solace hiding through the trees
Your laughter echoes in my ears
Washing away all my fears
Away on my face
So neon lights are guiding stars
Taking us to places afar
Where the future sparkles clear whenever you are near
Let's dance, let's dance'til the dawn breaks the night
Holding on to each other tight
Whispers shared in the midnight glow
Promising we'll never let go
Memories etched in our minds
Heartbeats at perfect time
This journey just begun
Two hearts beating as one
In the street, finds the shade so bright
We wander in the city night
My hand in yours, just us two
Dreaming in a world so new (a world so new)
Cherry blossoms fall in the breeze
We find solace under the trees
Your laughter echoes in my ears
Washing away all my fears (all my fears)
All my fears, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh you
Memory dashed in our minds
Heart beats in perfect time
This journey just begun
Two last beating as one
In the streetlights, the shade's so bright, we wander in the city night
My hand in yours, just us two, dreaming in a world so new
Cherry blossoms fall in a breeze, we find solace under the trees
Your laughter echoes in my ears, washing away all my fears, away all my fears
