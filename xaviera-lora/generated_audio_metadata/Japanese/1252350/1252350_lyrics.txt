The waves crash upon the shore where we carved our names
Promises of forever only love to blame
And the sun sets glow where the sea meets the sky
I keep asking why you left without goodbye
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Waves crash upon the shore where we carved our names
Promises of forever only love to blame
In the sunset's glow
Where the sea meets the sky
I keep asking why
You left without goodbye
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the sunset's glow
Where the sea meets the sky
I keep asking why
You left without goodbye
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Waves crash upon the shore where we carved our names
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Romance is a forever only love to blame
The sun sets glow where the sea meets the sky
I keep asking why you left without goodbye
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
With or without goodbye
