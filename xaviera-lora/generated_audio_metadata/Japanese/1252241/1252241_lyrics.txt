Let a little piece of yesterday play with a little hearts today
Moments passing never lasting still with you I want to stay
Dancing through the rain our own refrain
Will capture every seasons glow
Hands in hand we understand
It's in these moments feelings grow
As the sun sets down, no need to frown
Our symphony is just beginning
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Know that for me it's just beginning
It's in this moment, feelings grow
As the sun sets down
No need to frown
Our symphony is just beginning
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's just beginning
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-Da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-Da-da
Da-da
