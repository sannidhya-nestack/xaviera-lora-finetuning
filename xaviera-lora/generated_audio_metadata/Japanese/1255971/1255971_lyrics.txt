In the blasted heat they light
Observe our new voice
We unglow, heartbeats echo
A story never told
Start to sink under the moon
No need for words in this tune
I feel like I'm dancing on a star
We'll reach the heavens soon
We're painting colors in the sky
Oh, on this magical ride
Every heartbeat is a melody
Flowing like the tide
Under these cherry blossom trees
A starlight softly grieves
We're crafting dreams of radiant colors
Hot in life's gentle breeze
When faded dreams meet the dawn
In your arms I am reborn
Wishes whispered to falling stars
Amid the city's gentle moan
With your voice leading the way
My fears begin to sway
In this canvas of love
We seal our vow in Tokyo Bay
We're dancing to the rhythm
Of our constellation's prism
Lights flicker along in serenity
Taken in by their magnetism
Underneath the lantern
Glowing the love that we sow
Our harmony echoes
In the city's heart we know
We're painting colors in the sky
Oh, on this magical ride
Every heartbeat is a melody
Flowing like the tide
Under these cherry blossom trees
A starlight softly bleeds
We're crafting dreams of radiant colors
Hot in life's gentle breeze
When faded dreams will meet the dawn
In your arms I am reborn
Wishes whisper to falling stars
Amid the city's gentle moan
With your voice leading the way
My fears begin to sway
In this canvas of love
We see a love growing Tokyo Bay
We're dancing to the rhythm
