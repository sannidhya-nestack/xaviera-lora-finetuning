Colors flash, dope feels, heartbeat in neon lights
With you by my side, city's magic in our sight
Under the star-dappled sky, stories take flight
In the rhythm of J-pop, feel the love ignite
In the frenzy of lights, we find our stop
Living our dreams in a city full of smiles
We dance, we sing, making memories worthwhile
Then the melody of J-pop love compiles
Moonlight filters as the city paints the scene
Our hearts sync to Tokyo's vibrant routine
In each lyric, each note, in every beat we gleam
We're living our story like a captivating scream
Caught in the rhythm in Tokyo's fast pace
Our melody of love echoes in outer space
We dwell in the city's embrace
In the symphony of J-pop we're in the trace
In Tokyo skyline under the twinkling lights
A tale of our love in the J-pop nights
Just you and I caught in delightful sights
In the harmony of J-pop our love ignites
