Underneath the blue-teal sky, sleeping in the neon light
Every heart echoes through the bustling night
In each sakura's whisper taking flight
In this magical city love ignites
Where the stars meet the sunrise hand in hand
Guided by the rhythm of our homeland
In a timeless dance in this cosmic sand
United by a melody only love can understand
On cobbled streets, we share a faithful ride
A mosaic of moments by the riverside
Through a technicolor daybreak our dreams coincide
Under the same sky, we let love die
In this world where love and dreams intertwine
Where your smile meets mine in the morning sunshine
In a melody of the heart, pure and divine
Where every rhythm carries a sign
In this world where love and dreams intertwine
Where your smile meets mine in the morning sunshine
In a melody of the heart, pure and divine
Where every rhythm carries a sign
In the cityscape, koi fish glide
In the melody of time, our love coincides
Our story unfolds, there's nowhere to hide
And every corner love is our guide
As the lights flicker under the moon's light
In the whisper of love, every star takes flight
Here in Tokyo lost in the beautiful night
We find our melody loves magic alike
On cobbled streets, we share a faithful mind
A mosaic of moments by the riverside
Through the technicolor daybreak our dreams go in stride
Under the same sky we let love die
In this world where love and dreams intertwine
Where your smile meets mine in the morning sunshine
In a melody of the heart pure and divine
