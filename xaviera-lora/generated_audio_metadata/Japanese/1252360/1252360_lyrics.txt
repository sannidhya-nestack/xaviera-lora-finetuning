Beneath the moonlit sky, our spirits rise
The world of our dreams, be there where we're at
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
With every step our fears subside
With you, there's nothing left to hide
Your laughter echoes through my mind
A symphony that's so divine
Every moment with you feels so blessed
In your love I find my rest
Despite the city's endless noise
In your arms I hear no other voice
Together we'll dive into the deep
An ocean of promises we keep
Beneath the moonlit sky our spirits rise
We'll boil the dreams before our eyes
Together we'll conquer mountains high
Reach the clouds and touch the sky
In the quiet morning breeze
When the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace
In your gaze I'll find my key
Winds high
Reach the mountains high up and down
Wave your clouds and touch the sky
In the quiet morning breeze
When the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace
In your gaze I find my key
With every last word our promises grow
A love story only we know
Your hands and mine
We'll walk the miles through every trial
Through all the while
The days ahead are painted bright
Do everything feel right?
We'll dance in the rain, laugh in the sun
Our journey of two has just begun
In the quiet morning breeze
When the world is still asleep
Our hearts align in tender peace
In your gaze I find my key
Winds high
Reach the clouds and hide, oh no
Leave your clouds and touch the sky
Oh dance and light my key
Reach the clouds and grow
From us is grown
A love story only we know, oh no
In the quiet morning breeze
