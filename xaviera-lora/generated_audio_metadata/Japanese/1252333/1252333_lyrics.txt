In the garden of our youth, we glint, covering the truth
Laughter ringing like a song
Together we feel so strong
Cherry blossoms in the air
Dancing without a care
Romance fleeting but so sweet
Every time our eyes meet
In the beauty of the spring
Our hearts begin to sing
Melodies of love so pure
Knowing that we will endure
The sun sets on our past
But our love will always last
Hand in hand we'll face the dawn
With you I feel reborn
The path ahead is always clear
As long as you are near
Our journey'tis you and I
Beneath this endless sky
Won't make me think about it again
Moment, live you like I'm really new
I'm a joystick, you and I
Beneath this endless sky
Moments fleeting but so sweet, every time our eyes meet
In the beauty of the spring, our hearts begin to sing
Melodies of love so pure, knowing that we will endure
The sun sets on our past, but our love will always last
Hand in hand we'll face the dawn, with you I feel reborn
The path ahead is always clear
As long as you are near our journey
Just you and I beneath this amber sky
