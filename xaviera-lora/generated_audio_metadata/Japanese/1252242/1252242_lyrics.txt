Yeah, uh
Chasing dreams through endless skies
In your eyes the world complies
Breathing hope, let's elope to where our fantasies arise
Through the storm we'll keep each other warm
Our love will beckon in the night
With every verse we'll lift the curse of solitude
We'll make it right
In this vast expanse, we'll take our chance
Together in endless romance
With every verse, we'll lift the curse
Of solitude, I'll make it right
In this vast expanse, we'll take our chance
Together in endless romance
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Chasing dreams through endless skies
In your eyes the world complies
Breathing hope, let's elope to where our fantasies arise
Through the storm we'll keep each other warm
We'll love a beacon in the night
With every verse we'll lift the curse of solitude
We'll make it right
In this vast expanse we'll take our chance
Together in endless romance
With every verse we'll lift the curse
Of solitude we'll make it right
In this last six months we'll take our chance
Together in endless romance
Together in endless Swiss romance (Romance)
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Take our chance
Together in the next (Romance, romance)
Chasing dreams through endless skies
In your eyes, the world complies
Breathe in hope, let's elope to where our fantasies arise
Through the storm, we'll keep each other warm
We'll love a beacon in the night
With every verse, we'll lift the curse of solitude
We'll make it right
