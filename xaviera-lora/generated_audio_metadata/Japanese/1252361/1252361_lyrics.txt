Innocent and innocent, I fly high (innocent and innocent)
My story in sequence, I only come who can speak
With every heartbeat, the echo of our dream
Which is a glowing, tearing end at the seam
In the neon glow, we write our own stories
A dance of time, a carousel of glories
The night holds us tight, a gentle embrace
In this forever, we find our place
In the neon glow, we write our own stories
A dance of time, a carousel of glories
The night holds us tight, a gentle embrace
In this forever, we find our place
In the city of light, shadows that hide and seek
Whispering secrets that only the moon can speak
With every heartbeat, the echo of our dreams
We chase the dawn, staring at the seams
Through the neon glow, we write our own stories
A dance of time, a carousel of glories
The night holds us tight, a gentle embrace
This forever, we find our place
Through the neon glow, we write our own stories
A dance of time, a carousel of glories
The night holds us tight, a gentle embrace
In this forever, we find our place
So then we all grow, we write our own stories
A different time, a care, a show, a glory
A night holds us tight, a gentle embrace
In this forever we find our place
