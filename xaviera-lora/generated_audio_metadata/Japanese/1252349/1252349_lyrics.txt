Cherry blossoms fall through the twilight call
As seasons swiftly maul memories tall
In this tranquil space I see your face, a gentle grace
In our secret place
Whisper melodies
Through the swaying trees
Like the calming seas
Setting me at ease
Time will fade away
But not today
In this tender play
Where our hearts will stay
Dreaming side by side
The lights pass time
Love as our guide
Nothing to hide
In the pinkish, you found the blue
Every moment new
Just me and you
Cherry blossoms fall
Through our life's enthrall
Answering love's call
Standing tall
Cherry blossoms fall
Through our life's enthrall
Answering love's call
Standing tall
Dreaming side by side
Through life's best times
Love has our guide
Nothing to hide (nothing to hide)
In the pinkish, cute skies of blue
Every moment new
Just me and you
Cherry blossoms fall (blossoms fall)
Through our lives in brawl (lives in brawl)
As the rainbows call
Standing tall
Standing tall
