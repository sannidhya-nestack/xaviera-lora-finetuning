Through the falling leaves, I search for you
Your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But still I carry you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our names, love like fire, yet never the same
Across the sea, across the sky
I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
You are my silence, my endless light
Even in darkness, you shine so bright
Flowers always fall but there is wind
