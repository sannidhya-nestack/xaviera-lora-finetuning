In the heart of Tokyo, under neon lights
Walking beside you through the tropical nights
Your laughter rings out, a symphony of joy
You and me together
Nothing can destroy
We slave to the rhythm
Lost in the beat
In the city of dreams
Where love and life meet
Striding through the streets
Feeling so alive
Got a J-pop love
Nothing but good vibes
Under the star-studded sky
Hands intertwine
This electric city
And your eyes that shine
Between breaths and beats
In every glitch and frame
Our love story unfolds
Like a passionate anime
We move to the melody the cities embrace
In this world of wonder we found our space
Riding the rhythm in the unsolved glow
In our J-pop world we're in the flow
Look up to the starlight until dawn's first light
In the heart of Tokyo our hearts take flight
Creating memories in our J-pop life
Just you and me dancing through the night
