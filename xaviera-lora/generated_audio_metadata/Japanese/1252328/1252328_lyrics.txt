No need to do the heck, holdin' your hand we dance
Through the desert city lights, our hearts in a dance (oh)
Tryin' to set us apart, whisperin' tales of romance (romance)
Tears will shower silence, let's just follow glance
When the cold wind sweeps, we find our own chance
Together in this midnight dance
Murder the dream with sky, holdin' your hand we dance
Through the desert city lights, our hearts in a chance
Through the desert city lights, oh
I'm gonna to the sky holding your hand
We dance through the dazzling city lights
Our hearts in a trance
In a puff there's blowing tales of romance
Dreams for mans
Dreams of sweet love
Desperate tales of romance
Dreams we share in silence with just one glance
When the world sleeps we find our chance
Together in this midnight dance
Another day to dream with sky
Holding your hand we dance
Through the dazzling city lights
Our hearts in a trance
The moon shines above
Whispering dance of romance
Dreams we share with silence
With just one glance
In the west reach we find our chance
To gather in this midnight dance
Another day to dream with sky
Holding your hand we dance
Through the dazzling city lights
Our hearts in a trance
Through the dazzling city lights
Learning to dream big, I'm walking on empty gas
Through the dazzling city lights
