Hearts and lights swirl
In a dance of crimson gold
Stories of love and a past untold
Hands in pockets in the crisp air, no cold
Strolling through gardens feeling bold
Eyes meet as hearts silently unfold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
Autumn leaves swirl in a dance of red and gold
Stories of love and a past untold
Hands in pockets in the crisp air not cold
Strolling through gardens feeling both eyes meet as hearts silently unfold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hot and we swirl
In a dance of red and gold
Stories of love and a past untold
Hands in pockets in the crisp air not cold
Strolling through gardens feeling bold
Eyes meet as hearts silently unfold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
Promises made in sunsets we hold
