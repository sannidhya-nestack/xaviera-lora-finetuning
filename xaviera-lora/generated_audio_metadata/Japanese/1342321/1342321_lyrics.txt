Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Through the falling mist
I search for you
Your shadow lingers like the fading moon
Between two worlds we are torn apart
But still I carry you
Through you inside my heart
Winds of time whisper our name
Love like far yet never the same
Across the sea
Across the sky, I vow to find you, though lifetimes pass by
You are my silence, my endless light
Even in darkness you shine so bright
Flowers always fall
But their roots will
I'm heavenly home
