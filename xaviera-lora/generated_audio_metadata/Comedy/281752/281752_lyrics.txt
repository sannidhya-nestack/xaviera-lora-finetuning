Who'd want to marry a nurse?
Can't think of anything worse
It's one life's greatest curses
To fall in love with them nurses
She says you can't do this and you can't eat that
It's carcinogenic or has too much fat
Her dinner conversations gonna make you gag
When she talks about changing some colostomy bag
Can't think of anything worse than to marry a nurse
It's one of life's greatest curses
To fall in love with them nurses
Now you wanna take her out
You're gonna be miffed when she says she's gotta work a double shift
The walls are covered with a compilation
Of autographed x-rays of famous patients
Would I marry a nurse?
I can't think of anything worse
It's one of life's greatest curses
To fall in love with them nurses
But on a journey, on a gurney to the operating room
I saw a smile so caring and warm
With her stethoscope in charge she stole my heart
And I'm a sucker for a woman in uniform
So I asked for that hand in a surgical glove
There's only one thing worse than to marry a nurse
That's not to marry that nurse you love
I said there's just one thing worse in the universe
That's not to marry that nurse you love
