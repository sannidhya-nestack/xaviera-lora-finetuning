I'm walking when the stars are aglow
The wind is blowing, the music's low
People are sleeping, my footsteps echo
I'm a man, walking on and on
Everybody sing my walking song
Walking song, my walking song
Everybody sing my walking song
Of a man, walking on and on
I'm walking through the village, walking through the town
Walking through the city where the people frown
Lights are pretty, they're still looking down on a man
Walking on and on
Everybody sing my walking song
Walkin' song, my walkin' song
Everybody sing my walkin' song
All the men, walkin' on and on
I'm walking in the light and I'm walking in the shade
Walking in the country in a forest blade
Night has ended, morning begun for a man
Walking on and on
Everybody sing my walking song
Walking song, my walking song
Everybody sing my walking song
Of a man walking on and on
I'm walking through the wind, walking in the rain
Walking through the snow down a country lane
Walking at dawn'til the day is done
I'm a man, walking on and on
I'm a man, walking on and on
Lonely man walking on and on
