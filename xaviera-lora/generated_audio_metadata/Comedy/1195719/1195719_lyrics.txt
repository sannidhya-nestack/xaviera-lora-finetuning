I'll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business
is the people's business. And as president, I'm going to make it impossible for congressmen
or lobbyists to slip pork barrel projects or corporate welfare into laws when no one's
looking because when I'm president, meetings where laws are written will be more open to
the public, no more secrecy. That's a commitment I make to you as president.
When there's a bill that ends up on my desk as president, you, the public, will have five days to look online and find out what's in it before I sign it.
When there's a tax bill being debated in Congress, you will know the names of the corporations that would benefit and how much money they would get.
And we will put every corporate tax break and every pork barrel project online for every American to see.
You will know who asked for them.
And you can decide whether your representative is actually representing you
I believe I can laugh
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Grab my lips and lie awake
I believe I can soar
I bought a good bus but no home
I believe I can lie
I believe I can lie
I believe I can lie
