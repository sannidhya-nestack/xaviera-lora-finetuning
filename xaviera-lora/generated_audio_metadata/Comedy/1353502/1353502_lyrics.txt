Disabled big boob
What what
I'm a robot
(Robot)
My wires got too hot (too hot)
My battery's too low (so low)
You think I'm just a bot
But baby don't you know (don't you know)
Even robots need a break now and then
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Beep boop, beep boop
Beep boop, beep boop
Wait, now there's more of them
Beep boop, boop, beep boop
Man, you can't make this stuff up
Beep boop, boop, beep boops
Hey, who let these robots in here anyway?
Beep boop, boop, beep booph
I need to recharge every now and then
You got a socket and I wanna plug in
I need high voltage to fully recharge
I can tell by your dancing that you got the spark
I'm a robot
And sometimes a robot just needs to recharge, don't you know?
Why did they hardwire the battery in any way?
It would be so much easier if I could just
Swap them out
Eboop, yo, what's up with this guy?
Eboop, he really thinks he's a robot
Eboop, I think I need to go back downtown
Eboop, this place is too weird
I'm a robot, beep boop, beep, beep boop
No really I'm a robot, beep boop, boop, boop
Guys really I'm a robot, I swear
I'm a fucking robot, beep boop, beep boop
What do you say?
Can you believe it
It beep beep beep boop
That guy must be out of his mind
I'm a robot
I'm a Rube, Rube, Rube, Rube, R-r-r-r-r-rube, Rube, Rube, R-R-r-r-r-rube, Lube, R-r-r-r-lube, Lube, L-l-l-l-l-lube, Lube, L-l, l-l-l-l-lube, lube, l-l, l-l, l-l, lube, lube, lube, l-l, lube, lube
