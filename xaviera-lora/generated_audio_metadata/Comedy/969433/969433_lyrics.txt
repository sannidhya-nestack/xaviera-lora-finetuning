Ey up, I'm Chuffer and I like to rave
With me super bright sunflower hat on a long lost day
Me eyes are going wide, me mouth is going dry
Pish posh, pish posh, I'm feeling quite high
Onion gravy all over me glasses
Track suit bottoms stained with weed
The R .I .R. Kids, alright
Big fish, little fish, slippery little ears
Green laser lights, burning me eyes
Dripping with sweat, looking like a freak
Succumb to the music, breathe into the beat
Are you alright there love?
What a tough and tough night this is, eh?
Coming down that line
You alright mate? Feel the vibe
I'm completely lost, out my mind, surrounded by magic, in both eyes, I've handed over, me body and soul, we've all taken off, music takes control, one big wish, takes us away, up we go, flying in the sky, blowing gives a monkey's, we are all one, shoving it, I don't believe it, I just throw it up
Oh don't worry about that I'm just a bit sick I'm actually lying, lying I tell you, sorry about that flower, I tell you what this is tough night this is tough night, tough, toughing night, I'll be alright I'll be right, hey, hey, we're going up, up up up up, eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh don't worry about me look I'm alright here we go here we go
Me threadbare cardigan swinging to the beat
Me ironing board chin loves every one it meets
It's half past five in the early hours
Me saucer eyes fixed on the tarts all around
Sweating like a rapist even like a hoe
A woman's hand gently squeezes me ass
I strip myself down to me ties and underpants
Ready for some hardcore steaming action
Have a look around, everyone's pulsating
Place has become one big y
This is how it goes when you come to a rave
With your old mate chuffa out it's brains
Orgy, y, argy bargy
Time to disappear, indulge in some fun
Flying to the hotel over the road
Mr. and Mrs. Smith, how'd you do?
