There once was a time we were wild and free
We thought we'd never be parted
But then the years went drifting by
And you slipped away from me
Hair, hair, splendid and rare
Where in the world have you gone to?
Hair, hair, I wish you were there
Life is so lonely without you
I feel a new twinge of pain
Each time you clog up my drain
And who would have known
When you were thick and fine
That I would be losing you one at a time
Hair, hair, what can compare
The poets write love poems about you
Hair, hair, I just want my share
Life is so lonely without you
I used to push you around
I cursed when you wouldn't lie down
But I was so foolish
I didn't know then
That I would be joining the hair club for men
Hair, hair, it's so unfair
Others abuse and mistreat you
Hair, hair, they don't even care
They strip you and shave you and tease you
I used to smear you with goo
I washed you in Kmart shampoo
But if you'd ive me and come back to stay
I'll brush you and stroke you'til you're old and grey
Hare, hare, I'm in despair
Come back to me, I beseech you
Hare, hare, answer my prayer
Life is so lonely without you
Life is so lonely without you
