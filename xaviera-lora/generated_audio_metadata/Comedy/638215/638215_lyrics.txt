Having such a wonderful time
Eating BBQ chicken with wine
Got potato salad on the side
Of a BBQ chicken and wine
I coulda had fish, I like that dish
Especially with a slice of lime
But when that meat came out
There was no doubt
It had to be chicken this time
Having such a wonderful time
Eating barbecue chicken with wine
I got potato salad on the side
Of my barbecue chicken and wine
Now a bottle of white just wouldn't taste right
With the herbs and spices on this meat
So I think instead I'll have a bottle of red
That would really make my night
Having such a wonderful time
Eating BBQ chicken with wine
I got potato salad on the side
Of my BBQ chicken and wine
I could have had steak followed by cake
And washed it all down with a beer
That would have been fine but I prefer to dine
On BBQ chicken and wine
I'm having such a wonderful time
Eating BBQ chicken with wine
I got potato salad on the side
Of my BBQ chicken and wine
Keep your burgers and pies
I only have eyes for BBQ chicken and wine
