I got laid off'cause of the pandemic
I've never seen darker days
But Uncle Sam come bail me out
Never had a bigger raise
I was kinda bored and the bars were closed
Never been one to shop online
So I bought myself a bitcoin
Now my life is going fine
Gonna be a Bitcoin billionaire
That's a golden goose, I'm gonna get my share
Gonna wave goodbye for good to this peasant life
Maybe get a pad in Hollywood
California life is sure is good
Might get a supermodel for my wife
My daddy always taught me the values of a working man
He said, "Tow the line, you'll do just fine, save every dime you can"
That was before the days of crypto and there were no other way
I guess they lacked the technology to lie around and still get paid
Gonna be a Bitcoin billionaire
Hang out with Elon, we'd be a pair
Zoomin' along in our Teslas with two beauties by our side
Heard talk of a recession, guess some folks got that obsession
But I'm gonna smell the roses and enjoy the ride
Been checking out what folks are saying on CNBC
They call Bitcoin an inflation hedge
That don't mean much to me
Some say that it's just FOMO
Well I can't rightly say
But I get the picture
I'm getting richer
My fortune grows each day
Gonna be a Bitcoin billionaire
Global warming, I don't care
I'll board a rocket ship and fly to Mars
Maybe someday on a planet
Anyways that's how I plan it
Gonna ride that crypto straight up to the stars
Gonna be a Bitcoin billionaire
Gonna dance around in my underwear
Who could have known life could ever be so grand
My life has now gone digital
Run with the herd of the crypto bulls
Soon we'll be the rulers of this land
