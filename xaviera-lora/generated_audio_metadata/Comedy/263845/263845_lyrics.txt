In the city of Lincoln, Nebraska
A frustrated sailor was born
He read about ships that rolled out of the slips
And went sailing for years round the horn
He learned all the reels and the shanties
Still he's twelve hundred miles from the shore
Instead of seafaring
He sells pickled herring at the IGA grocery store
And it's way, hey, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way
Rig up the sails
We're off for the catch of the day
He sings
Yo-ho
Rig up the sails
To broil, to bake or filet
There's a ruffy and sprat
Catfish and cod
And we're running a special on prawns
He sings
Straight from the heart
To your shopping cart
It's the seafood shop shanty man song
He bellows his tunes o'er the speakers
Like the shanty man sings to the crew
Set sail for the seafood department
There's plenty of oysters for stew
There's turbo and trout and you'll knock yourself out
On the salmon from Frobisher Bay
There's swordfish and shrimp
And we never skimp on the salads made fresh every day
And it's way, hey, rig up the sails
We're off for the catch of the day
He sings, "Yaw-haw"
Or ring up the sales to broil, to bake or flambe
There's ruffie and scribe, catfish and cod
And we're running a special on prawns
He sings straight from the heart to your shopping cart
It's the seafood shop shanty man song
With his gaze on a bottle of old spice
Halfway down on the right, aisle ten
He longs for the days of the tall ships
And dreams they're returning again
And he sees himself out on the watch deck
Singing cadence of Pamlico sound
While he's manning his station
It's no imitation
Like those crab legs for two bucks a pound
And it's way, hey, ring up the sails
We're off for the catch of the day
He sings, "Yo-ho, ring up the sails"
To broil, to bake, or a touffé
There's ruffie and scrot, catfish and cod
And we're running a special on prawns
He sings straight from the heart
To your shopping cart
It's the seafood shop shanty man song
He sings straight from the heart
To your shopping cart
It's the seafood shop shanty man song
