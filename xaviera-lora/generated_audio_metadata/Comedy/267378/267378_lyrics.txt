Saturday mornings I'd walk out in my jammies
There'd be my daddy with his bucket and his chamois
High pressure nozzle and a natural sponge
Elbow grease to clean off the grunge
Then fortune dealt us all a double whammy
Drove off toward the auto zone, he was low on turtle wax
That was many years ago and he never did come back
It ain't the angel's bowlin' or the hammer of Thor
He's haulin' tail to God's Pep Boys store
Every time I hear the thunder crack
Daddy's washing the Chevy on high
That car shines like a comet in the sky
We miss him and that old'57
Daddy's washing the Chevy in heaven
With his sacred Simon eyes
He's buffing out the dings
In a spotless robe where the white dove sings
With holy water and armor all
He's cleaning tar off those old white walls
And pit marks from his chrome-plated wings
Daddy's washing the Chevy on high
That car shines like a comet in the sky
We miss him and that old'57
Daddy's washing the Chevy in heaven
Now I drive the straight and narrow
And keep him fondly in my memory
His eyes are on the Camaro
And I know he's washing over me
Daddy's washing the Chevy on high
That car shines like a comet in the sky
The tempest in paradise is revving
Daddy's washing the Chevy in heaven
Daddy's washing the Chevy in heaven
