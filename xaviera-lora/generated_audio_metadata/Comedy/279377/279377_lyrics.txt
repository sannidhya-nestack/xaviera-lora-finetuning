Good morning helpdesk
What's your problem today?
You turn on your computer
But you got no display
All the wires plug in
Is the power turned on
No power in your building
Yes I think that's what's wrong
I've got those helpdesk blues
I'm sitting on that phone every day
Where do these people come from anyway?
Oh, the masses are asses, the users are losers
What am I to do?
I sit all alone, I answer that phone
The help desk blues
Good morning help desk
What's your problem today?
Can you ask a stupid question?
You just did, I say
Oh, there's no stupid questions
I say with a smile
It's the people that are stupid
I think all the while I've got those healthiest blues
I'm talking on that phone every day
Where do these people come from anyway?
Oh, the masses are asses, the users are losers
What am I to do?
I sit all alone, I answer that phone
The help desk blues
Good morning help desk
State your problem please
In the middle of an update
The screen it did freeze
There was a message to continue, press any key
So what is the problem? You can't find the any key
I've got those helpless clues
I'm talking on that phone every day
Where did these people come from anyway?
The masses are asses, the users are losers
What am I to do?
I sit all alone, I answer that phone
The help desk blues
Hi, this is the help desk again
You don't deserve to have a computer
You really need to pack that thing up in the box that it came in
And send it back to the manufacturer
I don't want to ever hear you on this phone again
Do you understand me? Never call me again
Never call here
Don't you ever call here
You should not be playing with things that you don't understand
