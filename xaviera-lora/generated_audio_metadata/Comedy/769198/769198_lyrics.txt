But if cigarettes was medicine, I'd be a healthy man
I'd smoke at least ten packs a day, and I'd never get sick again
Some day they'll say cancer comes from eating too much spinach
And if dog shit was diamonds, baby, I'd be rich
If dog shit was diamonds, I'd open my own bank
Welcome to the very first national septic tank
Get out your boobie scoopers
there's a fortune down in that ditch
And if dog shit was diamonds, baby, I'd be rich
If getting drunk was virtuous, I'd be a patron saint
I'd drink a keg of beer every day, and nobody would complain
And you know cirrhosis of the liver, it would be on my Christmas list
And if dog shit was diamonds, baby, I'd be rich
If dog shit was diamonds
I'd own my own bank
Welcome to the very first National Septic Tank
Get out your poppa scoopas
There's a fortune down in that ditch
And if dog shit was diamonds, baby, I'd be rich
You know if dog shit was diamonds
I'd open up my own bank
Welcome to the very first national septic tank
Get out all your pooper scoopers baby
Cause there's a fortune down in that ditch
And if dog shit was diamonds, I'd be rich
I could see you on the front lawn
Following your french poodle all around
An empty sack in your hand
Waiting for the enema to kick in
Pull out your pooper scoopers baby
You know there's a fortune down in that ditch
And if dog shit was diamonds baby I'd be rich
You know, if dog shit was diamonds, we'd all be rich, ain't that a bitch?
If dog shit was diamonds, ooh
