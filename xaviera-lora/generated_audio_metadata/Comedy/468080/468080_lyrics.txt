Mama's making supper in the kitchen
Daddy's out currying the mare
Sissy's still talking on the telephone
She's going for a record I swear
Me and Davey setting up the table
Mama starts to hum a little song
Me and Davey heard that tune before
Pretty soon we're singing along
It's a song about beans (red beans)
Red beans (red beans)
With cornbread (cornbread)
And greens (and greens)
If you really wanna know what life means (know what life means)
Better start eating red beans
Everybody gathers round the table
Sissy is the last one there
She stomps out madder than a hornet
What the heck she do to her hair?
Davies squeaks out a little giggle
Mama shoots him down with a look
Everybody sits down easy
Daddy reads a blessing from a book
Now it's time for some beans (red beans)
Red beans (red beans)
With cornbread (red and honey)
And greens (Mississippi greens)
If you really wanna know what life means (know what life means)
Better start eating red beans
I'll eat some beans now
Beans with bacon, beans with cheese
Beans with chili gonna make you sneeze
You got frogs in the river and bugs on the screens
And a kettle full of steam and red beans
Mama sits with daddy by the fire
He puts a little kiss on her cheek
Sissy locks herself in the bathroom
She could be in there for a week
Be in Davy Place and check her
Pretty soon it's time for bed
The sheets are cool and silky
Although just one thing in my head
It's a song about beans (red beans)
Red beans (red beans)
With cornbread (red honey)
And greens (Mississippi greens)
If you really wanna know what life means (know what life means)
You better start eating red beans (red beans)
Red beans (red beans)
With cornbread (red honey)
And greens (Mississippi greens)
If you really wanna know what life means (know what life means)
Better start eating red beans
