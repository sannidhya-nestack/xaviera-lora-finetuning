Well, I'm a blues singer, baby
And as you might expect
I tend to be dejected
My love life, it's a wreck
This unfortunate condition
It's the price of my success
my fans are only happy
As long as I'm depressed
Oh, baby, you know what I mean
I'm the every single song someone done me wrong queen
Now I get by the time I've always been blue
I wonder what it'd be like to try out something new
But this game of fame and fortune it keeps me in a jam
In fact the worse I feel the more popular I am
Oh baby
It's the same routine
I'm the every single song
Someone done me wrong queen
Now Charlie was a boozer
Michael was a cheat
Leroy took my money and Jake died in his sleep
Buddy Lee was boring and Clarence was a jerk
And Raphael was phobic, he was terrified of work
So I went to see a doctor to get me back on track
He said I needed treatment and he put me on Prozac
A thousand dollars later I gained a little ground
But as soon as I felt better my record sales went down
Oh baby, I'm back to nicotine
Well, I'm the every single song someone done me wrong, queen
Eddie was a baby and Johnny loved cocaine
Jay was way too kinky and Bobby went insane
Dave was halfway normal but he got hit by a truck
Then Michael drowned in Puget Sound and Frank ran off with Chuck
So I tore up my prescription
I drank a couple beers
And I wrote a million seller
That had everyone in tears
My dream of love and romance
It can all go up in smoke
I'd rather be in misery
Than satisfied but broke
Oh baby, call my limousine
I'm the every single song someone done me wrong queen
I'm still the every single song someone done me wrong queen
