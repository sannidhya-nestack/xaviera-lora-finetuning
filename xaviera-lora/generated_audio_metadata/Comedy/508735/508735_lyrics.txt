I'm kicking round a yellow balloon
Dishes are stacked way up to the moon
Someone is dancing with an old straw broom
It's time to listen to the Sandman play his sleepy-eyed tune
My bed is singing (da-da-da, da-da-da)
The Snooze Land song (da-da-da, da-da)
My heart is winging (da-da-da, da-da-da)
To where I belong (da-da-da, da-da)
My mattress is heaven (ah)
My pillow's a dream (ah)
Wrapped in my pajamas, dreams of the Bahamas
Calling out my name, my bed is crooning
The Snoozland theme
Soon I'll be joining
That Snoozland team
When I take my ease, they'll fill me full of z's
I'll drift off to somewhere grand
I want to listen to the sandman making music with his astroland
Let me sail, let me drift on the ocean of Zs
I'm heading for Slumber Town
I'm gonna sleep like a log in the land of Nod
I'll shut eye till the sun comes round
In the arms of Morpheus let me abide
Carried on a mystic ride
In a fabulous ship with my astral guide
I'm gonna sail on the slumber tide
My bed is clean
Rooting the snoozeland theme
Soon I'll be joining that snoozeland team
When I take my ease they'll fill me full of z's
I'll drift off to somewhere grand
I want to listen to the sandman making music with his astro band
Let me sail, let me drift on the ocean of Zs
I'm heading for Slumber Town
I'm gonna sleep like a log in the land of Nod
I'll shut eye till the sun comes round
In the arms of Morpheus let me abide
Carried on a mystic ride
In a fabulous ship with my astral guide
I'm gonna sail on the slumber tide
My bed is clean
Pruning the snooze-land theme
Soon I'll be joining that snooze-land team
When I take my ease they'll fill me full of z's
I'll drift off to somewhere grand
I want to listen to the sandman making music with his astro-band
When I take my E's they'll fill me full of Z's
I'll drift off to somewhere grand
I want to listen to the sandman making music with his astro band
