I like to watch the girls and boys
Do them any good if you want them little toys
Merry Christmas from who? (You)
Merry Christmas from who? (You)
Merry Christmas from who? (You)
You see this comin' to town
On the twelfth days of Christmas my true love gave to me
A great big sack of reality
So I went up and I killed him but before I did he said
Ho ho ho my name's Saint Nick would you like to climb in bed?
I've got a lot to say
Man I never knew that Santa Claus was gay
And I'll watch you sleep at night
I know what you want and I know what you like
I like to watch the girls and boys
You better be good if you want some new toys
Merry Christmas from who?
Merry Christmas from who?
Merry Christmas from who?
They say just come into town
They say just come into town
They say just come into town
People hate me like
I hate Christmas time (Santa's coming to town)
There ain't no secrets that you want answers to (Santa's coming to town)
I may be live, you may never (Santa's coming to town)
Be together with
The sand's coming me down
People hate me but I hate people (and I'm coming too)
