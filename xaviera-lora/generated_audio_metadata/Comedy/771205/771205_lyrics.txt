When I was a little baby, I sucked on my mama's breasts
Hey, when you're six weeks old, that's as good as it gets
But I don't do that kinky thing anymore
You see, mama cut me off when I turned thirty-four
I love tits, I love tits (tits, tits)
I can't get enough of its (I love tits)
Call me a chauvinist pig, I don't give a shit
I love tits
Old Farmer Brown had a thing for Bessie the cow
Spent way too much time in the barn with that gal
He told his wife, honey, your tits are great
But you've only got two and Bessie, she's got eight
I love tits
I love tits
I can't get enough of it
Call me a chauvinist pig, I don't give a shit
I love tits
Let's face it folks, tits are fun
I think everybody oughta have one
Erotically speaking, it all comes down to this
God made those holy hooters and I love tits
I love tits, I love tits, but I can't get enough of it
Call me a chauvinist pig, I don't give a shit,'cause I love tits
You call me a show-off and a pig, I don't give a shit
Baby, I love tits
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tits, tits, tits, tits
