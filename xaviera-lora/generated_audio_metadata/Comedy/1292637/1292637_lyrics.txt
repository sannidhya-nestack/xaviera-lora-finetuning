I don't question you when you throw those jelly donuts in the cart
So don't you ask me if I need those cookies from the grocery mart
I'm not gonna let you bully me in the frozen food section of the store
if you do I won't go food shopping with you anymore
I don't need you to supervise what brand I choose
And I don't tell you which shaving cream you should use
Don't keep asking me what I need so much tinfoil for
if you do I won't go food shopping with you anymore
I won't go, whoa
I won't go
Oh if you try to judge me
Anywhere in this grocery store
I swear to you I won't
Go food shopping with you anymore
Don't raise that eyebrow if I choose sprouts instead of peas
'Cause I don't make a face when you throw in your locale cottage cheese
Don't rush me down every aisle of the grocery store
if you do I won't go food shopping with you anymore
I won't go, no no no
I won't go
Oh, if you try to judge me anywhere in this grocery store
I swear I won't go food shopping with you anymore, anymore
