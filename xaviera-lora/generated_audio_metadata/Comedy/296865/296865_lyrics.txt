Maybe I should liposuck the fat from my thighs
And Botox the wrinkles away from my eyes
And invent a very clever spider vein disguise (not yet)
I think I'll love me just as I am
Maybe I could do five hundred crunches a day
And then I'd have a six pack I could display
And I could be more careful where I leave my DNA
No blue dress for me, think I'll love me just as I am
I don't think I am a big mistake
The stars aren't finished with me
Self hate is a lousy fuel
To get me where I want to be
Maybe I should never let my vegetables spoil
And always reuse my aluminum foil
And I could have been president if my daddy had been in oil
Think I'll love me just as I am
Hey mister maybe you should be taller and have more hair
And if you could tango you'd be more debonair
And look like Tom Cruise in his underwear
I don't even like him anymore
Think I'll love you just as you are
Great spirit isn't a prankster
Who messes with us when she gets bored
Life is a magical mystery
We need to cherish and not just endure
Maybe I should always know just what you need
And give and give and give and give until my soul bleeds
And be absolutely perfect or you will leave
Too codependent
Think I'll love me just as I am
I could spend my whole life
Practicing doubt and fear
Comparing myself to some impossible ideal
But if I do that I'll sacrifice my soul
Instead of celebrating what's here and what's real
Well, maybe life's champagne hasn't lost its fizz
And maybe what you think of me, well, it's none of my biz
And maybe there's perfection in just what is
I think I'll love me just as I am
I'm gonna love me just as I am
I'd better love me just as I am
