Let's have a Caribbean ukulele party
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
We'll sing Calypso to get the party started
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
Calypso on the beach beneath the moonlight
Dancing in the water under stars
We'll have a Caribbean ukulele party
Caribbean ukulele fun
Popo and banana
Pineapple and lime
Kaleinoscope of colour
Who cares about the time
The salsa hot as summer
The drink as cold as ice
Us boys are so good looking
The girls are oh so nice
Let's have a Caribbean ukulele party
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
We sing calypso to get the party started
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
You can be a pirate on the ocean
Or search for buried treasure on the beach
We'll have a Caribbean ukulele party
We'll have some Caribbean ukulele fun
Caribbean ukulele party
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
We sing calypso together, party started
Let's have some Caribbean ukulele fun
Gotta be an ukulele party
Let's have some gotta be an ukulele fun
We sing calypso to get the party started
Let's have some gotta be an ukulele fun
