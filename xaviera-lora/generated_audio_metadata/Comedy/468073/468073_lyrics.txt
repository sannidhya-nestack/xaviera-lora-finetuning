Honeymaker, won't you be my baker
Toast me golden brown
I've been rising, need some supervising
Please don't turn me down, she said
You best et your plan
You're not my kind of man
Now get out while you can
Lovely creature, won't you be my teacher
We could PhD
I've been yearning for the high of learning
You could give to me
She said, "He likes jam and her she likes jelly"
Now why don't you get smart?
"He likes pizza and she likes jelly"
We're much too far apart
"He likes fall and she likes summer"
And I'll just break your heart
Sweet musician, grant me an audition
Don't be so unkind
I will write you something to delight you
And help you change your mind
She said, "He likes blue and she likes yellow"
"He plays cool"
Your love's not wanted here
Why don't you disappear?
You'd best et your plan
You're not my kind of man
Now get out while you can
