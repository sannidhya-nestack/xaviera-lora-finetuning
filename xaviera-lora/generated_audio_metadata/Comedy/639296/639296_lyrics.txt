I'm thinking about running for president
Or maybe Pope
Pope Rufus the 9th
Nah
But if I did run for president
And if I was elected
I would see to it that everyone on earth received a daily allotment of sex and money.
Maybe it would work like this.
The sex and money assessment specialist would come to your house and assess your sex and money needs.
And when that amount was properly determined,
Every day, at an appointed time,
the sex and money allotment specialist would come to your home.
And they would gently wake you and say,
Good morning
You're beautiful
It's time for your
Sex and money allotment
How much do you need today?
How much sex and money
Do you need today?
Whatever you need
That is what you will get
If you need a lot of sex and a little money
That's what you'll get
A lot of sex and a little money
If you need a little sex and a lot of money
That's what you'll get
A little sex and a lot of money
Now if you're like me and you need a lot of sex and a lot of money
That's what you'll get
A lot of sex and a lot of money
I hope you'll vote for me
A vote for me is a vote for sex and money
A vote for me is a vote for sex and money
A vote for me is a vote for sex and money
That's what it's all about
