Why does everybody call me big head?
I've measured it, it seems perfect to me
I have such a lovely face
And I win every race
There's nothing in this world too much for me
But why does everybody call me big head?
I must admit I'm good at all I do
At school I was the best
Yes, I beat all the rest
But I don't know why they call me big head
Do you?
My mum said I was born a perfect baby
The doctor said this boy he will go far
I have a high IQ, I know I'm brighter than you
every year I buy a brand new car
But why does everybody call me big head?
I must admit I'm good at all I do
I know I have real charm
There's always a girl on me arm
But I don't know why they call me big head
Do you?
Why does everybody call me big head?
I've measured it, it seems perfect to me
At sport I am the best
Outside all the rest
Passed the first time round
When I took me driving test
But why does everybody call me big head?
I must admit I'm good at all I do
I'm such a lovely guy
Never told a lie
But I don't know why they call me big head, do you?
But I don't know why they call me Big Head, do you?
