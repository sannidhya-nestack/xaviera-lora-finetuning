Seems like everyday we hear another guy saying it's a lie
Need another politician
But it's rarely superstition
Funny how these fellas can't seem to stay away
From every pretty mama
Who hopes to make him pay
Boys just wanna have fun
But soon they're on the run
Can't seem to stop the urge
And stories seem to surge
They're just repeating history
Guess it's in their DNA
Every guy in trouble says it didn't go that way
Give him one more chance
And he'll screw up the romance
The boys just wanna have fun
But soon they're on the run
Can't seem to stop the urge
And slowly seem to surge
When all is said and done
He lost all that kind of fun
Every female crying
Will make him pay for lying
For all his hanky-panky
He needs more than just a spanky
The boys just wanna have fun
But soon their arm will run
Can't seem to stop the urge
And stories seem to surge
Yeah, the stories seem to surge
