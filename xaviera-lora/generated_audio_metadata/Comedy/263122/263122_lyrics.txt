My girl is fried country crock
She robs gas station quick stops
In her tube top shorts and work boots
She's regular on cops I miss her
So when she's in jail it depresses me
That's her officer, third from the right
But I have a ball on conjugal calls
When I hear her scream
Yeehaw, come here you little son of a gun
Where's my turkey pot pie
She can wrestle a hog in mud and I ain't talking bout her mama
There's bloodhound in her blood, she could sniff out Osama
Her beard grows natural, she don't wax them hedges
She ain't been to beauty school, she don't know what glitch is
But she graduated truck school
Hell yeah, she's bawdy
Her degree's mama cum laude
But I like my sugar raw and unrefined
Warm and dirty beats cold and clean
Don't want no domestic queen
I'm glad she ain't got
The Martha Stewart gene
It's a good thing
I'm the king of our trailer
She feeds me like a god
Servin' me burnt offerings
I just pray it ain't the dog
There's daisies growin' in the toilet she got from the dump
And her uncle is my brother-in-law
Looks like Forrest Gump
They just love chewin' the backie together
Hell yeah, she's bawdy
Her degree's mama cum laude
But I like my sugar raw and unrefined
Warm and dirty beats cold and clean
Don't want no domestic queen
I'm glad she ain't got
The Martha Stewart chain
It's a good thing there's no deep end in her gene pool
I ain't eatin' what I can't pronounce
Escar-what? Spam and beans, that's who I am
No need to redecorate the trailer
Nothing better than my skunk centerpiece
A wedding gift from the taxidermist
My beard cap Elvis figurines
My dog's playin' poker velvet picture
Hangin' above Mama's autographed Bible
What she autographed it herself
Here's to imperfection, these girls ain't painting their house of corrections
Don't need no high class broad messing up their selves
Warm and dirty beats cold and clean
Who wants a domestic queen?
I'm glad they ain't got
They ain't something that they're not
I'm glad my baby ain't got
The Martha Stewart gene
It's a good thing
