Hey neighbor, ever have those days
When you suffer that severe malaise
Well there ain't no words for the way I feel
I'll try to tell you about this tune inside
My mind is moving but my tongue is tied
Cause there ain't no words for the way I feel
I go for the chorus, a vacant thesaurus
Is anemically pernicious
There's no solution through circumlocution
It's indescribably malicious
This sad modality I'm living in
Invents a vacuous oblivion
Cause there ain't no words for the way I feel
Verses are vexing
Prose is perplexing
Attempting to serve this song
I know I'm just messing
With hollow expression
While the melody lingers on
Guess it's best to just resign my faith
Except this funk I can't articulate
Ain't no vernacular
Ain't in no lexicon
There ain't no
For the way I feel
