Yeah yeah I, I'm in
Decks on fire
Pencils fly (fly)
Always screaming I won't comply
Graffiti grins
Locker doors slam
I spit on rules
Thank you ma'am
Detention, riot, hear us roar
Chaos and a key we want more
Laughing in the face of every law
We break, we bend, we claw
Should we stop?
Stop, honey, this is just the start
Staplers hurl, chalk dust storms
Teachers panic, we ignore the norms
Silence from beneath the neon lights
We're alive, misfits, at last night
Detention, riot, heroes roar
Chaos, anarchy, we want more
Laughing in the face of every law
We break, we bend, we claw
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Rules are fiction, school's a joke
Crowd yells, feedback screams
Bass, thumbs, guitars grind
We own this all, now rewind
Tension riot, the walls collapse
Sparks fly, chaos maps our tracks
Laughing loud, breaking the mold
Queen of noise, uncontrolled
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
