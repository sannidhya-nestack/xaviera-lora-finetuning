I know a place that's really great
Where we can find a hot pastrami sandwich fried
And stay out late, oh, we can dine and drink fine wine
Or stuff our faces with delights to satisfy our appetites
The smell is grand, the taste divine
I love to eat the gourmet foods, I want them now
And all the time it fills my soul, it fills my belly
Oh yes, my dear, we're going to the kosher deli
I like salami, love pastrami, corned beef, turkey, brisket too
A matzo ball and chicken soup, like a filter fish
Oh what a dish, potato, kugel, apple strudel
Chocolate cake I can't resist, stuffed cabbage, latkes, kasher, knishes
Laks and bagels, that's my wish
And while we fresh and make a mess
I feel my body swelling up, my head is spinning
Oh my, yes, it fills my soul, it fills my belly
Oh I'm so glad to say we found a kosher deli
I like salami, love pastrami, corned beef, turkey, brisket too
A matzo ball and chicken soup, you're filled to fish
Oh what a dish, potato kugel, apple strudel
Chocolate cake I can't resist
Stuffed cabbage like it's kashik
Dishes like some bagels, that's my wish
And while we fresh and make a mess
I feel my body swelling up
My head is spinning, oh my yes
It fills my soul, it fills my belly
Oh I'm so glad to say we found
The Kosher Deli
The Kosher Deli
