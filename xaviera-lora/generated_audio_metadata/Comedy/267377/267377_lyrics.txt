Our town's not the biggest around
But it does have a stoplight in it
Takes a minute and ten from end to end
If you drive'bout five or the limit
That's unless you get behind
This old farmer friend of mine
He goes as slow as a bass boat trolls
And his rusty dusty fifty-four holes
I'd have been here about an hour ago
But I got stuck behind Buford
Now Sam McKay on his wedding day was to marry the great school teacher
She's crying at the aisle, he's closer than a mile, but he just can't reach the preacher
But the reason wasn't Sam, it was our one-man traffic jam
He goes as slow as a fast boat trolls in his rusty, dusty'54 Rolls
I'd have been here about an hour ago
But I got stuff behind Buford
Don't you know it'll be my fate
When I get up to the pearly gates
I'm gonna have to sit and wait
Staring out my windshield at his license plate
he goes as slow as a fast boat trolls
And that rusted busted cussin' old
Saint Peter Ida band here in Marathon
But I got stuck behind, just my luck behind
I got stuck behind Buford
