I'm going to tell you some true stories about things that really happened to me, so you'll have some idea of the adventures you might have if, God forbid, you're ever unable to see.
Don't brush your teeth with preparation H
It foams but it does not clean
And listen for the little birdie to chirp
To make sure that the light is green
But keep your ears wide open
In case someone says you're going the wrong way
That's my advice I have for you
If you go blind today
If you go blind today
Life can still be fun
If you don't go insane
When people say
It's over there
When you ask for direction
Don't walk into an airport bathroom Without closely checking the sign
if you're in the wrong bathroom The men won't fuss or whine
They'll simply raise their faces to you Like so many cows chewing their hay
That's my advice I have for you
If you go blind today
If you go blind today
Life can still be fun
If you don't go insane
When people say
Can you hear?
After a ten minute conversation
Don't pat the butt of the man standing next to you
Unless you're sure that he's your mate
if he's not your husband, oi, the problems you'll create
Just wave your cane and smile sweetly
And say, "Are you talkin' to me?"
That's my advice I have for you
If you go blind today
If you go blind today
Life can still be fun
If you don't go insane
When people say
Your seat is 32D
Going blind is really a bummer
But it's not a tragedy
Don't let your joy die on your retina
And you can be just as happy as me
If you go blind too
Life can still be fun if you don't go insane
When you try to screw in a light bulb and you stick your fingers in the socket
Or when you wash your face with hair conditioner
Or when you lose your sense of humor
Don't lose your sense of humor
If you go blind today
