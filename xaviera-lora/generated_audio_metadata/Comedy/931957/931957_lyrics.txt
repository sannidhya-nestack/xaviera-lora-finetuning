Why am I standing in this room?
And why am I looking around the room?
I know I walked in, and I'm looking for something thin.
So why am I standing in this room?
And why am I opening up all these drawers?
And why am I looking in these drawers?
Is it something I want?
Is it something I bought?
So why am I opening up the drawers?
I've done this before
But it seems to be happening more and more
I don't know why I do these things
My body is somewhere else and my mind is not cooperating
So why am I standing in this room?
And why am I opening up all the drawers?
Am I losing my mind?
Is that what I'm looking for?
So why am I standing in this room?
