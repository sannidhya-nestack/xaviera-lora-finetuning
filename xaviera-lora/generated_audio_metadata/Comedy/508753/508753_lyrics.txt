I've got a happy ukulele
Sitting on my knee
A happy ukulele
Is real good company
Ukulele heaven is a friend to sing along
Nothing makes me happy like a ukulele song
I've got a happy ukulele
Travelling with me
A happy ukulele
We'll set your troubles free
A little bit of talent
And make a lot of fun
A happy ukulele in the sun
A happy ukulele is medicine indeed
A daily dose of happiness is all you'll ever need
I'll write you a prescription, you can put it to the test
Take one ukulele and play it at your best
A happy ukulele can solve so many woes
It fixes many heartaches and puts you on your toes
Don't put it in the cupboard
It's so good to play our little ukulele every day
I'll write you a prescription you can put it to the test
Take one ukulele and play it at your best
Don't put it in the cupboard
It's so good to play our little ukulele every day
I'll write you a prescription, you can put it to the test
Take one ukulele and play it at your best
Don't put it in the cupboard, it's so good to play
Our little ukulele every day
I've got a happy ukulele, sitting on my knee
A happy ukulele is real good company
Ukulele heaven is a friend to sing along
Nothing makes me happy like a ukulele song
I've got a happy ukulele
Traveling with me, a happy ukulele
Will set your troubles free
A little bit of talent can make a lot of fun
A happy ukulele, a happy ukulele
A happy ukulele in the sun
