Well I got so many problems and I'm feeling low down
Nobody wants me hanging around
I'm gonna drown my troubles in some bourbon and beer
I'm going back to the bar room and find my usual stool
I know I'm just a bum and a fool
I'm gonna drown my troubles in some bourbon and beer
Well now the life that I'm living ain't the way it should be
But nobody seems to care about me
It's time to drown my troubles in some bourbon and beer
I'm so tired of living, but I'm too young to die
The world keeps turning and life's passing me by
I'm gonna drown my troubles in some bourbon and beer
Well yes I am
