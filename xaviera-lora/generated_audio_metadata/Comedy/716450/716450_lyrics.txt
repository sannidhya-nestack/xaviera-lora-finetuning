Baby, you've been really, really, really rude
I can't stand this treatment and this attitude
You hurt my soul and now it feels so bad
You know what I'd do to make me sad, sad, sad
I hate your smile
I hate your walk
I hate your squeezy-squeezy-squeezy-dizzy talk
I hate your sight
I hate your smell
And I hope you die in pain and you will burn in hell
You stole my heart and sold it cheap on sale
Drank my blood and wondered why I'm pale
You failed, examined love and now you go to the gym
Now you get a D because you're mean, mean, mean
I hate your smile, I hate your walk
I hate your squeezy, sleazy, greasy, dizzy talk
I hate your sight, I hate your smell
And I hope you die in pain and you're a burning hell
Man, this freaking bastard made me stand in a corner
Innocent child in the house of sorrow
Not an Avenger, but none of the priests
I wanna see you cry because you're beast, beast, beast
I hate your smile
I hate your walk
I hate your squeezy, sleazy, greasy, dizzy talk
I hate your sight
I hate your smell
And I hope you die in pain and you will burn in hell
I hate your smile, I hate your walk
I hate your squeezes, whizzes, grins and tears, it's dumb
I hate your sight and I hate your smell
And I hope you die in pain and you will burn in hell
I hate your sight and I hate your smell
And I hope you die in pain and I hope you die in pain
And I hope you die in pain and you will burn in hell
