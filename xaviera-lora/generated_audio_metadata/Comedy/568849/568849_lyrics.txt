I didn't used to like brussels sprouts, brussels sprouts
There ain't no doubt that I could live without'em
Brussels sprouts, I don't like how they roll around on my plate
And I didn't like asparagus, asparagus
Where in the world did they get that mess they call asparagus?
I'm scared I guess to try it for the very first time
But I needed a change
every green bean looked the same
I was bored out of my mind
'Cause I only ever tried one kind of vegetable
And then I heard about an artichoke, a scholar wrote
They're good for what ails you and that's no joke
You take an artichoke for a very sore throat
And soon you'll be feeling fine if you needed a change
If every green bean looks the same
If you're bored out of your mind
Are you only ever trying one kind of vegetable
And now I really like Brussels sprouts
Brussels sprouts
I eat'em down now and I don't think about'em
Brussels sprouts
I even like how they roll
Around on my plate
