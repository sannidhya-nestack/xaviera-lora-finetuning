A one, a two, a three, a four
You run with the wolves and the woman that's wild
Come home and spank your inner child
You read the self help book, there's no doubt
You grow and you grow till your growth out
You get naked with the boys and bang the drum
Make a lot of noise till the kingdom come
Get sweaty from the yoga and tai chi
You can use some aroma therapy
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Listen to me though it may sound strange
Behave yourself and your life will change
You buy the cellular phone to keep in touch
With the people that you don't like too much
You swim with the sharks till you succeed
So you can buy the things that you don't need
You want a funeral mound to put you on ice
So you can come back and make the same mistake twice
You meditate to free your soul
Try practicing rebirth control
We overeat and we overdrink
Overwork and we overthink
Smoke the camel and we high on stress
Turn the mind and the body to a terrible mess
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Listen to me though it may sound strange
Behave yourself and your life will change
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Behave yourself (Behave yourself)
Listen to me though it may sound strange
Behave yourself and your life will change
Behave yourself
