I was a big noise up on Wall Street
They called me Mr. Flash
When my bonuses were paid
I was awash with cash
But then the markets tumble, and soon my life was trashed
As I lost everything in the year 2000 crash
And now I look up Wall Street, and I find my office seat
But from a new reality
Down here on my feet
There are holes in my pockets
Worn down heels on my shoes
Since I've got nothing left
Then I've nothing more to lose
'Cause I got no home, no job, no car, no phone
No wife, no boat, no dog, no phone
I wonder the empty roads all alone
With no cash, no dog and no phone
But when I smile then all my troubles float away
The fact I keep on smiling all through the day
And my grin is so very wide it almost splits my face in two
And when you hear my laughter it'll bring happiness to you
But I got no home, no job, no car, no phone, no wife
No balls, no diamonds, no bones
I wanna be empty roads all alone
With no cash, no diamonds, no bones
Don't worry about me, I'll be alright
Just leave me ten dollars and I'll drink your health all night
No home, no job, no car, no phone
No wife, no boat, no dog, no phone
I wander the empty roads all alone
But no cash, no dog
Get off my leg, go on, go on, go push up, go on push up, I ain't got a phone, I ain't got a, get off my ass, get off my
Get him off me, get him, get him off me, get him off me, call the police, call the police, get him off me, no, no, no!
Oh, I hate dogs, can't believe it! The only clothes I ever had now they're in ruins, can't believe it!
I'm gonna sue, I'm definitely gonna sue! How will I find a lawyer? How will I afford that?
