Let's spend the rent on beer and wine and liquor
Let's spend the rent on things we can't afford
Let's spend the rent on dancing and romancing
Let's spend the rent for the house, let's get a tent
I used to work most every day, turn my daily away
Find myself just wondering if work was worth the pain
Every sometimes and again my feelings have to bend
I wake up at some stranger's house
With all my money spent
Let's spend the rent
On beer and wine and liquor
Let's spend the rent
On things we can't afford
Let's spend the rent
On dancing and romancing
Let's spend the rent
Start up the house let's get a pen
You want money, I got money, I got lots of money, I go spend it all, it's a new day, let's spend the rent
On beer and wine and women
Let's spend the rent on things we can't afford
Let's spend the rent on dancing and romancing
Let's spend the rent, fuck the house, let's get a tent
