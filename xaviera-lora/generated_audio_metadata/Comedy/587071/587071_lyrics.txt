Yee-haw! Wee-doggy!
Well, my mother is my sister, wife, and cousin
We have such a crazy family tree
My mother is my sister, wife, and cousin
I'm sure you wonder how this all can be
Well, daddy and grandma married as cousins
They gave birth to my mommy
Grandma died and daddy then married mommy
That's when they gave birth to me
Well daddy died and I then married mommy
She gave birth to several kids with me
My wife is my children's grandma
But she is everything to me
My mother is my sister, wife and cousin
We have such a crazy family tree
My mother is my sister, wife and cousin
I'm sure you wonder how this all can be
Alright, now it's time for me to end my story
As confusing as it still might be
My kids are my aunts and uncles
They're brothers and sisters to me
My mother is my sister, wife and cousin
We have such a crazy family tree
My mother is my sister, wife and cousin
Cousin, sure you wonder how this all can be
She's my mother, my sister, my wife and my cousin
She is everything to me
