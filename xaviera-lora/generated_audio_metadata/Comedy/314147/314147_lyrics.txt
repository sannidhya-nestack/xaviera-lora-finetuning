A fair and charming stranger passes by
And sets your heart aflutter with affection
But before you choose to give new love a try
Let me offer just this word about protection
Gleefully we greet the season of Mother Nature's joyful dance
Every beastie bird and flower is preparing for romance
You and I are no exception, we must heed love's ancient call
But when you get that tingle and feel the need to mingle
There's one thing I would like to recommend
A little piece of plastic on the end
When you meet that special someone
It may take you by surprise
Rising out of conversation or a twinkle in the eyes
Soon you sense your fondness growing
And you feel your heart on fire
But if the one you fancy appears a little chancy
There's one precaution that you should extend
A little piece of plastic on the end
God has made you fit and fertile
God has given you the need
Never doubt the huge potential
Of that frisky little seed
Choose from many shapes and colors
Mountainous to micro-size
Buy a present for your neighbor
In a shade to match his ties
For a playful party favor
That your guests will long enjoy
And for a stunning innovation
In household decoration
Blow some up and hang them in your den
A little piece of plastic on the end
In a risky situation, stand courageous, do not bend
You can rise to the occasion if you put your faith into your little rubber friend
Gleefully we greet the season of Mother Nature's joyful dance
Every beastie bird and flower thrums with rhythms of romance
You and I are no exception, we must heed love's ancient call
But when you get that tingle and feel the need to mingle
The best investment dollar you can spend
Is for a little piece of plastic
A little piece of plastic on the end
