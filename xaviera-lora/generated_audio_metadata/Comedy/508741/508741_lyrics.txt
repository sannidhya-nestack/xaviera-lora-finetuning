When I met my ukulele girl it wasn't as you'd think
I didn't hear the violins I simply heard a plank
Just one plank was all it took to set my heart aflame
I found my ukulele girl knew every song I'd made
We formed a ukulele band and played around the world
Everybody seemed to love my ukulele girl
We'd play rodeos, clubs and halls
We'd dress up oh so swank
I had money in my pockets and kisses in the bank
We'd blink every night
We'd blink every day
Every blinking opportunity to blink our lives away
Blinking in the country
And blinking in the town
Have you ever tried to blink and wear a crown?
I told my ukulele girl she looked so good in plink
She raised her glass and smiled at me and gave me such a wink
We've got some little plinkers who strum along with mirth
They strum their ukuleles every day since birth
We plink every night we plink every day
Every plinking opportunity to plink our lives away
Blinking in the country and blinking in the town
Have you ever tried to blink and wear a crown?
We'd formed a ukulele band and played around the world
Everybody seemed to love my ukulele girl
We'd play rodeos, clubs and halls, we dressed up oh so swank
I had money in my pockets and kisses in the bank
We'd blink every night, we'd blink every day
Every blinking opportunity to blink our lives away
Blinking in the country and blinking in the town
Have you ever tried to blink and wear a crown?
Blink every night, we blink every day
Every blinking opportunity to blink our lives away
Blinking in the country and blinking in the town
Have you ever tried to blink and wear a crown?
