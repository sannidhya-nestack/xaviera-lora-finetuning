I'd rather play in the middle of a freeway
With toxic, inflammable toys
Then show any sweet vulnerability
To sarcastic adolescent boys
You know the kind who feign sincerity
Just hoping that you'll take their bait
Then they pull the rug from beneath
And laugh as you wriggle on their stake
Well I know that they're not really evil
Though they practice
Cruelty, love
They're insecure, hormonal
Just plain terrified
That they don't have the right male stuff
So they hide out in cocky bravado
Thinking that is true masculinity
When really they're just a walking billboard for adolescent insecurity
But when they unite their forces, ganging up
All in one class
Well it really doesn't matter what
You try to teach them
You're gonna fall on your sweet little ass
So I'd rather have a mouthful of septic root canals
Or listen to fingernail on blackboard noise
Teaching sarcastic adolescent boys
