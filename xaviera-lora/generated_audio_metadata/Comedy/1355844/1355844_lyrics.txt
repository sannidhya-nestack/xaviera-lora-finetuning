I don't know what I was thinking when I went to bed that night
Maybe my life was boring and I needed to do crazy life
So I went to the hotel spa and asked them if they had a spot
Little did I know that things would change a lot
I was in this hotel in Vegas
Not a typical place I'm fond
But being stuck after a cancelled flight
I thought why not try blonde
My wife thought I was joking
After we talked about my head
But little did I suspect
My hair would turn out orange red
My curiosity
Got the best of me
And now I only wear a hat
And next time I see a salon
I'll make sure to move along
I don't know what I was thinking when I went to bed that night
Maybe my life was boring and I needed to do crazy light
So I went to the hotel spa and asked them if they had a spot
Little did I know that things would change a lot
