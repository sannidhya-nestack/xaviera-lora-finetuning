Let me tell you something, if you leave the door wide open
I won't come into your house
Believe me babe, the check's in the mail
That sure as black is beautiful, last night was wonderful
And I promise you won't go to jail
Trust me, just trust me, if I ever lie to you, then bust me
I'll call you soon, it's getting late, now you're not overweight, guarantee, just trust me
Now listen up, I respect you in the morning when you wake up by yourself
And I can't wait to meet your mom and dad
So let's settle down, let's go and tie that knot
And I'll give you all my Google stock
girl, you're the best I've ever had
Trust me, just trust me (Trust me, honesty, that's my motto)
If they ever lie to you, then bust me
I'll call you soon, it's getting late
No, you're not overweight, guarantee
Just trust me
It's 100 % money back ironclad guarantee
And all you gotta do is trust me
Yep, that's all you's got to do is trust me
Besides, if you can't trust me, who can you trust?
Where you going? How come you're walking away?
No, don't call the police
Just trust me
I'm outta here!
