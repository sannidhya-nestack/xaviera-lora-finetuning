I'm home alone without my phone
The wind is rattling the window
I'm home alone without my phone
I'm gonna hide under my pillow
Spooky night, I jump with fright at every bang and bump and creak
I wish that I could phone a friend
To hear them calmly speak
But I'm home alone without my phone
The wind is rattling the window
I'm home alone without my phone I'm gonna hide under my pillow
Can't go out for takeaway I've only got a carrot and a leek
I really want to break away But the weather is kinda bleak
I'm home alone without my phone
The wind is rattling the window
I'm home alone without my phone
I'm gonna hide under my pillow
Hide under my pillow
Gonna hide under my pillow
