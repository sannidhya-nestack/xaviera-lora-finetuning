The world can be a bitter place When trouble's on your stare
But keep one thing in mind, my friend And you need not despair
When there's a grapefruit in your life
Every morning is a treasure
When you stumble from your bed
Your eyes are slits of red
And your tongue tastes like a tire
When you open up the door
Of your frost free Kelvinator
There's a gleaming yellow sphere
Right behind the beer
Cast aside your cares and strife
There's a grapefruit in your life
When there's a grapefruit on your plate
You tremble with anticipation
When a perfect golden jewel
Succulent and cool
Awakens to your fond caress
When you pierce the blushing skin
Juices flow in all directions
Slice a tender ruby wedge
With your cool serrated hedge
Bow your head and celebrate
There's a grapefruit on your plate
I have known life's greatest pleasures
Rembrandt, Keats and Mahler
But how can Keats compete with these
At three pounds for a dollar?
When there's a grapefruit in your mouth
You can scarce believe you're mortal
Every tender bite you chew
Spreads a sweet and fruity goo
Over every tooth and gum
Tooth and gum
And your taste buds burst with song
In a fructose exultation
Let us bid a fond salute
To the noble citrus fruit
Thank your grocer, thank the South
Thank the South
There's a grapefruit in your mouth
