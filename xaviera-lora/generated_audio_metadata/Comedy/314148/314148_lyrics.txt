We're going to the landfill
Why don't you meet us at the landfill?
Things are coming to a standstill
In every other part of town
They're putting up a bandshell
They're passing out a hand bill
Yeah, we're going to the landfill
And we're gonna have a real good time
Yeah, we're going to the landfill
Come on and meet us at the landfill
Things are coming to a stand still
In every other part of town
They're putting up a band shell
We're passing out a hand bill
Yeah, we're going to the landfill
And we're gonna have a real good time
There's gonna be a demonstration
Against a major corporation
For repeated violation
Of environmental rules
We're gonna press for litigation
There's gonna be a confrontation
And every television station
Is gonna put us in the news
Yeah, we're going to the landfill (it's a perfect day)
Come on and meet us at the landfill (throw some stuff away)
Things are going to stand still (cause you're extra jump)
In every other part of town (into your pickup truck)
They're putting up a banner shelf (broken sliding doors)
The vast amount of hand-me-downs (bought into by force)
Yeah, we're going to the landfill (it's a hot day)
We're going to have a real good time (yes, yes we are)
Well, a handsome politician
Will make a critical decision
To establish a commission
To consider the complaint
He'll do a big investigation
Collect a lot of information
He'll introduce some legislation
But nothing's going to change
Yeah we're going to the landfill (it is a perfect day)
Why don't you meet us at the landfill (throw some stuff away)
Then we're going to a standstill (pause your exercise)
And every other part of town (into your pickup truck)
To putting up a banner shelf (roll up in sliding doors)
To passing out a handbill
Yeah we're going to the landfill and we're gonna have a real good time
Yeah we're going to the landfill
Come on and meet us at the landfill
Then we're going to a stand still
And there's another part of town
She's loading up a band shell
The place is not a hand mill
Yeah we're going to the landfill and we're gonna have a real good time
Yes, yes we are
Yeah, we're going to the landfill
It's a holiday
It's all for real good
Tide
