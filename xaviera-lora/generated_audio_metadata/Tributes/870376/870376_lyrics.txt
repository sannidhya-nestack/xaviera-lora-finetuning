Stairs upon the temple I climb and I crawl and
Wonder how much further I'll go, ooh
Feet that fall apart'til I walk on my ankles
Can I finish, I just don't know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, La
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
People travel millions of miles just to see it
But they never conquer this way, ooh
I can tell them the greatest games have conditions
But they're too far to hear what I say
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
