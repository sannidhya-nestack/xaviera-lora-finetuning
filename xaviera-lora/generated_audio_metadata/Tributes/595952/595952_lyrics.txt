Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me
Your love is like ecstasy

Out of my mind
Out of my sight

Look so fine, you look so good
You look so fine, gonna make you mine
Out of my mind, out of my sight
Now you're out of my mind, out of my sight
Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me
Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me
Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me
Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me

Your love is like ecstasy
Your love is like ecstasy to me
