You make it rain, we make it pour
They want some more, we waving money like we aired out
Air it out, air it out
They want some more we waving money like we air it out
Run that run that run that track
Just my kicks they cost a stack
My whole fit don't know bout that
Get low get low jump on back
On it, I'm rolling hard like Sonny
I'm puffing on some cronny
Don't drink till I'm unconscious I'm unconscious ayy
You make it rain, we make it pour
They want some more we waving money like we air it out
Air it out
Air it out
They want some more we waiting money like
I'm in it
Running like Emmett
Phantom of the menace killed beats is the premise
I did it
I did it
All about bread and my head is embedded
In it for the long game
No doggo I'm never in the wrong lane
Uh
Won't switch like King James mine like a bunch of bosses in a think tank
You make it rain, we make it pour
They want some more, we waving money like we air it out
Air it out, air it out
They want some more, we waving money like we air it out
I'm a G but you knew this
To the beat, yo we moving
Get money, be so foolish
All day is how we do this
Hit the streets, see nothing but killers
Speak from soul, it might sound realer
Beat my chest, hit top gorilla
But what we speak, it gets much bigger
You make it rain
We make it pour
They want some more we waving money like we air it out
Air it out
Air it out
They want some more we waving money like we
They want some more we waving money like we air it out
