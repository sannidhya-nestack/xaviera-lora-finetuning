Behold the way our earth goes round
Creating ever-fervent sound
Lusting all material things
And not for what true beauty brings
I ask of you my fellow friends
See here now what does transcend
The noblest station on this earth
That's been with you since birth
Oh wondrous mother earth
How is it you're so good?
Your love makes our world so bright
We feel your warming glow
It gives us strength to know
All in the world that's right
It's the way your wisdom brings
All our precious things
As if on angels wings you're our light
You live inside our hearts
Where all goodness starts
Oh, hello motherhood
It's all we need to know
Help, oh mother, help
It's the way your wisdom brings
All life's precious things
As if on angels wings you're our light
