I've seen you'round downtown
I wonder how you do it
You are always cold, cold, cold
And it's so, so old
I'm through it
And I say, hey, hey
You're heartless
And I say, hey, hey, you're heartless
I heard it through some friends
You had a little bash on me
You were just a bad bad seed
Desperate need to be free
And I say hey hey
You're heartless
And I say, hey, hey, you're heartless
You're heartless, mmm, you're heartless
Oh, oh, oh
Now I've been lonely too
I made it through to see
I never let you get to me
Your cold dishonesty
And I say hey hey
You're heartless
And I say hey hey
You're heartless
And I say hey hey
You're heartless
You're heartless
Mmm mmm mmm
You're heartless
Mmm mmm mmm
You're heartless, you're heartless
