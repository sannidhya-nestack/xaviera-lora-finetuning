Every bird starts to sing
Wedding bells chime and ring
When there's love in the air
Every sound that I hear
Whispers you in my ear
When there's love in the air
Every thought, every dream
Every vision I've seen
Shows me love's in the air
I'm ten feet off the ground with my head spinning round
Yes, there's love in the air
When there's love in the air
When I'm here or I'm there
I have no other care but to hold you my dear
When there's love in the air
Every moment with you makes my heart say I do
To everyone unaware I will shout and declare that there's love in the air
In the dark of the night you bring light to my life when there's love in the air
There's just you, only you, and no other will do
And there's love in the air
As you walk to and fro, I become Romeo
And there's love in the air
I am living each day just to tenderly say yes
There's love in the air
When there's love in the air
When I'm here or I'm there
I have no other care but to hold you my dear
When there's love in the air
Every moment with you makes my heart say "I do"
To everyone unaware I will shout and declare that there's love in the air
When there's love in the air
When I'm here or I'm there
I have no other care but to hold you, my dear
When there's love in the air
Every moment with you
Makes my heart say "I do"
To everyone unaware
I will shout and declare that
There's love in the air
