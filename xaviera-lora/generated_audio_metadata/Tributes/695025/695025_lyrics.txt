I saw you again, I knew just where you'd be
I'll stop this real soon when you're back safe with me
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll hide it good
I'll never cry again when you come home to me
In pictures, I'd see it, you weren't really there
In truth, I still feel it hanging in the air
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll hide it good
I'll never cry again when you come home to me
I'll never cry again when you come home to me
