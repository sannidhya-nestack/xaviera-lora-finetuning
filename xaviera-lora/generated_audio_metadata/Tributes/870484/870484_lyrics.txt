And you give what you take, and you live what you say, ooh
I-da-da-da-da-ive, you give, you live, you live, you give
Your love lifts me up high
High
Your love lifts me up
Your love lifts me up high
High
Your love lifts me up
Mosaic come
Most high come
Your love lifts me up high
High
Your love lifts me up
Your love lifts me up high
I, I, I, I, I
Your love lifts me up, most high come
