Inna budda house now things poppin' up
Say word a go wrong, you ragga twins inna your club
Say right now me tired and me wan' take a seat
Let me see you move your body to a drum and bass beat
You hold the rope down, them love it so much
Them a line up again,'cause them can't get enough, baby
Give me a break, let me spark up a bud
And no make it wicked,'cause you ragga twins inna your club
Ragga twins inna yo club
Ragga twins inna your club
Inna budda house now things popping up
Say word a go wrong
Ragga twins inna your club
Say, "Riiight !"
Baby mi dun know you're sweeter
Nuff dance you get pain no ear inna your feet
You hold the rub down them love it so much
Them a line up again
Ca dem can't get enough
Baby, give me a break
Let me spark up a bud
And now me get wicked
Ca Ragga twins inna your club
Rock the trends inna ya club
Raga twins inna ya club
