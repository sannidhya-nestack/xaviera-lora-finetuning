Baby, what if you and I could switch up the rules?
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call, I never pick up the phone
Uh-uh, uh-oh, what you think of that, uh?
Baby, what if you and I could switch up the rules?
You could be the one who's waiting at the house alone
Every time you call, I never pick up the phone
Don't think for a moment
Switch up the rules at the house alone
Pick up the phone
Don't think for a second that I couldn't be like that
