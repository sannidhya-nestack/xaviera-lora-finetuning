We popping bottles in the club, it's Friday night and we feel alright, what you say about it? Nothing, what you say about it? Nothing, we popping bottles in the club, it's Friday night and we feel alright, what you say about it? Nothing, what you say about it? Nothing, what you say about it? Nothing, what you say about it?
Just throw your body in the air
Wild out like no ones there
Drop bombs, atomic
Or you could slam like onyx
I peep game through my optics
Throw your body don't stop it
Just throw your body in the air
Wild out like no ones there
I'm a G but you knew this
To the beat, yo we move it
Get money, be some foolish
All day is how we do this
And it might just hit me
Two shots of whiskey
Straight to the dome
I'm getting tipsy
We popping bottles in the club
It's Friday night and we feel alright
What you say about it? Nothing
What you say about it? Nothing
We popping bottles in the club
It's Friday night and we feel alright
What you say about it? Nothing
What you say about it? Nothing
Just throw your body in the air
Wild out like no ones there
Drop bombs, atomic
Or you could slam like onyx
I peep game through my optics
Throw your body don't stop it
Just throw your body in the air
Wild out like no ones there
I'm a G but you knew this
To the beat yeah we moving
Yeah money be so foolish
All day is how we do this
And it might just hit me
Two shots of whiskey
Straight to the dome
I'm getting tipsy
We popping bottles in the club
It's Friday night and we feel alright
What you say about it? Nothing
What you say about it? Nothing
