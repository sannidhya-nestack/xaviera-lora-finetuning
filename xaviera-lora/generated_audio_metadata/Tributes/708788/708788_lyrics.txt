I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up
All this life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love
It's the biggest part of me
Life is too short to waste a second of my time
Nothing can stop me'cause I know that I'll be fine
I won't hold on to what some people think is right
it's my life and I'm not scared of all those nasty things they say
And each and every day can only make me smile
I only see the best, I'm never giving up
Don't wanna be like those who only have regrets
I love this life too much and I don't wanna feel it with the pain
I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up
All this life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love
It's the biggest part of me
Faith is the only thing that's good enough for me
It fills me up each day each second that I breathe
No one can give me more than faith can give to me
And I don't care if it's wrong or it's right
Because I know what is best for me
And each and every day can only make me smile
I only see the best, I'm tired of giving up
Never say never but I'm never gonna stop
Celebrating everyday cause I know that's the only way yeah
I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
Cause it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up all this life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love is the biggest part of me
More and more I'm happy when I see the ray of light
Every morning when I rise I tell myself that I'll be fine
Happy'cause it's my own life (oh oh oh oh oh)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up
All these life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love
It's the biggest part of me
I will never give up, give up
