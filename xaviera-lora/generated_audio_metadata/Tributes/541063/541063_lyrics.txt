I barely talk, I've said enough
I'm all used up and I miss home
This life is strange, I'd rather no name
Just count the days'til I get home
Just count the days'til I get home
These roads are rough
And some corrupt
I just threw up, but they lead home
Gave you all that I've got
To hell and back
I did my time, please take me home
I did my time, take me home
I did my time, just take me home
I've been knocked down, all bloodied up
But on the ground, I see home
Then I get up
et the hate
I see your face and I am home
I see your face and I am home
I see your face and I am home
I am home, I am home, I am home, I am home
