As I lay down on this old couch
I'm thinking of you
These songs I hear on my record player
All remind me of you
Here I go again
Trying to win your heart
You're my best friend
Loved you from the start
This song's for you my heart
As I sleep here under this old tree
I'm dreaming of you
And when I wake up and you're beside me
I can't help but hold you
Here I go again
Trying to win your heart
You're my best friend
I loved you from the start
This song's for you my heart
As I sit here on this old chair
Can't help but think of you
These songs I write
Come out of nowhere
But they're all for you
Here I go again
Trying to win your heart
You're my best friend
I loved you from the start and every song I sing
I sing from the heart this song's for you my heart
