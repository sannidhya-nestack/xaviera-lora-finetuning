I never wanna work so hard
As to rob myself the pleasure
Of time with you
You're special
And I hope I never take for granted
All the wonderful things you are
You're special
You're special
I've known a lot of girls, it's true
But never anyone like you, you're special
All the beautiful things you are
Fill the skies inside my mind with the stars
You're special, you're special
I wanna tell you you're special
You're so special
And Katerina is the perfect name
And I can promise I will feel the same always
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
You're special
You're so incredible in every way
I'm so glad I had this chance to say
You're special, you're special
I wanna tell you you're special, oh you're special
You make rainbows in my mind
You make the sun come out and shine
You make rainbows in my mind
You make the sun come out and shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
