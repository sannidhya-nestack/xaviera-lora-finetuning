I'm gonna lay you in on a little secret
How you become number one
I wanna tell you my secret
How I get it done
Ass kickin' isn't pretty
But it's pretty damn fun
Let me strap you in my monster truck
And take you on a little run
Say hello to my speed demon
The reason I'm number one
This won't hurt too much baby, ha
Come on let's have some fun
Ain't nobody know I'm nothing gonna slow me down
I've got to pay to see the world only once, never to love me no more
Nitro kickin' in
Diamonds run through
454
Battle to the floor
Balls to the wall
My speed demon call
I gotta need
Full speed
I gotta need
Full speed
I gotta need
Full speed
I gotta feed my need for speed
Ain't nobody, no one, nothing gonna slow me down
I got the name, it's pain to feed, no one gonna stop me now
Back against the wall
I answer to the call
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I got a need for speed
I gotta feed my need for speed
I got a need for speed to feed
Nothing gonna slow me down
I've got a need for sleep, I've got a need for sleep, I've got a need for sleep, I've gotta feed my need for sleep
