You don't give a damn and you don't understand
You're trying to take a stand without any plan to make it better
You're running with the ball and you're gonna take a fall
Devastating call it's a big time stall it doesn't matter
You know your eyes are blind, say it's gonna take some time
Your actions are unkind, blaming nickels and your dimes upon your platter
Running all around while you're hanging with your clown
Who's gonna take you down when you're falling out of town? It doesn't matter
One by one
All the days go by
One by one
All the tears you cry
One by one
And the days go by
One by one
Count the tears you cry
Trying to make some sense from your fabricated fans
Kills you try to rinse in yourself induced defense I'm growing older
Giving up the chase as you're trying to save your face
You're living in disgrace and it's such a silly waste you're getting colder
Running all around like a foolish little clown
You're falling to the ground
You gotta hear the sound it's getting bolder
Do you realize that I see it in your eyes
And much to my surprise still hiding in your lies it's on your shoulders
One by one all the days go by
One by one all the tears you cry
One by one and the days go by
One by one count the tears you cry
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one by
One by one by
One by one by
One
