When the summer sun
Slips below the waves tonight
When the evening comes and brings the stars we wished upon
My last wish is summer never dies
We must part when summer ends
In my heart our summer sun will shine again
Till the morning
Stay with me along the shore
Here forever we'll remember fun
In the summer sun
We must part when summer ends
In my heart, our summer sun will shine again
the morning dawns
Stay with me along the shore
Here forever
Remember fun in the summer sun
In the summer sun
In the summer sun
