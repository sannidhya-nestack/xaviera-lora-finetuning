We getting ready for Showtime, for Showtime (You all ready? Let's go)
It's about to go down
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
We ready for show time, for show time (In the jail, one cell, it's about to go down)
We ready for show time, for show time, for show time
We ready for show time, for show time (You all ready? Let's go)
It's about to go down
Yeah I'm ready for shit time, for shit time, for shit time
I'm ready for shit time, for shit time (I'm a general by the sound of it so let the world hear me)
Yeah I'm ready for shit time, for shit time, for shit time
I'm ready for shit time, for shit time
