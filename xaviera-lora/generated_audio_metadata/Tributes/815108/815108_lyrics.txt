When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In those old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Chautauquina
In those old cotton fields back home
When those cotton balls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton in those old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In those old cotton fields back home
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
When I was a little belly baby my mama would rock me in the cradle
Indo's home, Godfield's back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
Indo's home, Godfield's back home
When those cotton balls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In those old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In those old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me, yeah
That's a lot of cotton
