I get so jaded, working all day
Trying hard to make ends meet
I drag myself home and open the door
And my little girl's smiling at me
Just for a moment my blues get erased
When I look at that smile on her face
Through the eyes of a child
I can see clearly
Through the eyes of a child
That's the way life should be
I can't help believing
This mixed up world
Would be a much better place
We could only see through the eyes of a child
Tomorrow morning I'll head on back to the red dress I know so well
Cause sooner or later I'll probably feel like I'm going through a living hell
But I hope I remember how good life can be when my little girl smiles at me
Through the eyes of a child
I can see clearly
Through the eyes of a child
That's the way life should be
I can't help believing
This mixed up world
Would be a much better place
We could only see through the eyes of a child
In this big old world there's a thousand different ways to say hello
But a child's smile means the same thing no matter where you go
Through the eyes of a child I can see clearly
Through the eyes of a child
That's the way life should be
I can't help believing this mixed up world
Would be a much better place
If we could only see
Through the eyes of a child
If we could only see through the eyes of a child
