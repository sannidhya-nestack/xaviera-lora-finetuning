It's done, no one's won, betray me no more
It's done, no one's won, it's all come undone
Don't trust your life in my hands
Can't trust myself these days
Won't see what I see
Danger and death await me
Blood and betrayal at every turn
Scream this dream ten thousand times
You et how it feels
Dead cold eyes reveal
Won't let the darkness in (back to now anyhow)
Don't et how to feel
Can't trust myself these days
Danger and death are so real
Done with one
And done
Done with one
It's done, no one's won, betray me no more
It's done, no one's won, it's all come undone
Won't let the darkness in, Magnet now anyhow
Don't et how to feel, can't trust myself these days
Danger and death so real
Stand alone, live or die, lie to kill every day
Suffered this torture ten thousand times, sick, spent living this way
