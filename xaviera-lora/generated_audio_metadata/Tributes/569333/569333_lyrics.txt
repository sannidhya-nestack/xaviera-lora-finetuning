A lonely life, a lonely world
A lonely guy, a lonely girl
Losing hope, what's going on
What went wrong so long ago
You found frauds, the head can see
You found fakes, you found deceit
You searched high and you searched low
But you were never alone
I know who you are
I knew from the start
His only love is of himself
Your trophy on his crowded shelf
On his wall, pictures of himself
Narcissist in good health
And in the end, we're all the same
Expendable, used in the game
Disposable
All along, so sing with me
This is our song
I know who you are
I knew from the start
When you lose your faith in love
I'll be the one to warm your heart
I'll be the one to touch your soul
I'll be the one for you to hold
When you're lost and alone
I'll be the one to show you
I'll show you what it's like from above
Show you all we need is love
All we need is love
All we need is love
All we need is love
All we need is love
I know who you are
I knew from the start
