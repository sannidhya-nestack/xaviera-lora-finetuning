Don't you know you're taking me higher
Oh you know you're making me sweat
Don't you know you're taking me further
To places I ain't ever been
Ooh, something's taking over me
Girl, you know I can't breathe
Ooh, you're taking over me
Just take me to infinity
Don't you know I'm nothing without ya
Oh you know I can't survive
Oh you're showing me an adventure
Oh you make me feel alive
Ooh something's ticking over me
Girl, you know I can't breathe
Oh, will you take it out on me?
Just take me to infinity
