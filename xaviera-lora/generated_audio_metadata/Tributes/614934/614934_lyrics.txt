Small tree blocks my vision from a brush-stroked sky
Gentle breeze blows your perfume as you walk by
They say love comes in different ways
Mine came in a surfer's wave, what do I do?
With a girl like you
What do I do
With a girl like you
I'd walk on water
Just to get to you
Use all the madness
Silence to sound the darkness
What can I do with a girl like you?
Fine to talk to you but you shied away
You know how to play the game to make me stay
I struggle with madness
Trying to find your name
What can I do with a girl like you?
What do I do with a girl like you?
I'd walk on water just to get to you
Use all the madness, silence the sound of darkness
What can I do with a girl like you?
What do I do with a girl like you?
I'd walk on water just to get to you
You serve the madness
Silence the sound of darkness
What can I do?
With a girl like you
What do I do
With a girl like you
I'd walk on water
Just to get to you
You serve the madness
Silence the sound of darkness
What can I do with a girl like you
With a girl like you
With a girl like you
Just you
