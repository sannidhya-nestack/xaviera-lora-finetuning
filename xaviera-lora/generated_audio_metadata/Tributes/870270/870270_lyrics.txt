Underdog, yeah I got him rooting for the underdog
Underdog, that's right I got him rooting for the underdog
Jorntons in the gold chain living it up
Pens sagging gold grills living trilling the cut
Your dreams gotta follow mine
Swimming in the money, Scrooge McDuck
Seeing dollar signs, all I know is gotta grind
Check, pull up in a portion
Cisco rings just like Jordan
And Cisco rings yeah I'm sporting
Yo chick on me so take caution
We getting cash in so many amounts
Want you to scream and I want you to bounce
Bounce like a check in a checking account
Bounce like a check in a checking account
They don't wanna see you win (see you win)
Them haters rather see you fall (see you fall)
But see I'm getting money, man
And now I got'em rooting for the underdog (yeah, underdog, underdog, underdog, underdog)
Yeah, I got'em rooting for the underdog (yeah, underdog, underdog)
(Underdog, underdog, that's right I got'em moving for the underdog)
So I'm in the 80's city
I'm getting money baby
The haters can't understand it
I hear a lot of compliments
Most of them underhanded
I don't take it for granted
Because I came from the bottom
I'm just happy that my name is mentioned with all these options
But when you're thinking of options
I'm the best that you got
Mr. Talent over height
Mr. Never to flop
If you need it, I got it, I'll be bringing it to ya
I got the whole mix real booming like that new Drake and Future
