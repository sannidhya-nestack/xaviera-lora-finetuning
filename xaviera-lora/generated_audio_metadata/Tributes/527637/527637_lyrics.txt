In the quiet of an autumn afternoon
Park bench dreaming winter days in bloom
And I know I should be moving on
But I really hate to go
This is the closest thing to a home that I've ever known
But it feels like snow
Miles and days go by and it's a cold December dawn
Now I'm outside Kansas City breathing clouds and rubbing palms
My money's gone and my clothes congealed
My thumb can't seem to get in the wheels
I'm hungry and I'm cold and I'm lonely then she comes along
And with three words we're gone
Need a ride?
Just moving on
I say I'm nowhere bound she's going for LA
I guess picking up a rider was another way to stake her claim
She says I'm gonna be a star boy make the world cry if I choose
But the makeup that hit her age couldn't hide her youth
Or protect the things she had to lose
Anyway we roll on down the highway headed west
Stars and calls and late night bars, the beacons for our quest
The hours fly by and a wind regales and our conversation soars
The long lost friends who I've never met before
And she's so full of life and life's allure
And so much more
We hit Tucson Friday morning after five
As the sunlight spits the dark and the desert vista comes alive
I say I can feel the city calling me like a mother to her child
Then I laugh and I wait for her wit to wail on my lineage and old some life
But she only starts to cry
She tells me I've been in Kansas since the day that I was born
I was suffocating bored and I had to find out there was more
So I ran away from the ones I love
For a dream I can't be certain of
And I'm ashamed to admit that until this trip
I never realized how I'd miss them so
But I've got to find what I came looking for
Cause there ain't no cure
Oh, don't hate me, there ain't no cure
But I couldn't hate her even if I tried
she reawoke what I'd lost inside so long, long ago
Then she smiles and says, "Come away with me, we'll make the whole world cry, we'll set the whole world free"
And I want you to know, but that's a dream not mine
Moving on, it's the only life I've ever known
Moving on, now I know I need a place to call my own
I've been feeling no feelings for so, so long
You know it's funny how the fates our fortunes cast
She only dreams about her future, I only mull about my past
And I didn't have no direction on, I came along here for the ride
Tucson was just another place away from the places I can't hide
But when she opened up my heart it fell inside
So when the Tucson sunset fills the western sky
In the desert silhouette against the canvas of twilight
I watch her daylight gleam and fade to grey
And my heart screams girl don't go away
And I hear my voice yell baby make the whole world cry
And even though I know I'm gonna miss her
I hear it say goodbye
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
