You can change me whatever you want
You can make me come and gone
You can save me whatever you need
But I'll still be me
You can change me whatever you want
You can make me come and gone
You can save me whatever you need
But I'll still be free
Mmm, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, oh, gone, oh, oh, gone, hey
You can change me whenever you want
You can make me come and gone
You can save me whatever you need
But I'll still be me
You can change me whenever you want
You can make me come and gone
You can save me whatever you need
But I'll still be free
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh
