I want to live a life
I want to live a life that can't move
I want to live a life that can't move, can't move
I want to live a life
Come on
I want to live a life that's
Come on
I want to live a life that's
Come on
Come on
I want to live a life that can't go wrong
I want to live a life that can't go wrong, can't go wrong
I want to live a life
Come on
I want to live a lie
