I look them in the eye
But they don't see me
Invisible I am
Chasing a dream
If I were to die, would anyone know?
Seems fate came up short and I need to go
And I'm gone out through the window
I'm gone lightly away
The sun blinds my eyes and I see her face
And she's smiling at me
Leave a motion at the door
Let it be
But that would be rude and she wouldn't see the real me
Her smile took me without warning
How could this girl be laughing with me?
And I've gone out through the window
I've gone lightly away
The sun blinds my eyes and I see her face
And she's smiling at me
They don't see me
They don't see me
They don't see me
They don't see me
And I've gone out through the window, I've gone lightly away
The sun blinds my eyes and I see her face
And she's smiling at me
