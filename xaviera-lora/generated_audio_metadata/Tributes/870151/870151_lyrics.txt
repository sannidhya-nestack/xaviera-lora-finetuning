All the things that we wished, they never came true
All the promises made were broken by you
All the choices you made, would you make them again?
All the lies that you told, did you believe in them?
I don't wanna be in love, ooh, in love, oh-oh
I don't wanna be in love, ooh, in love, oh-oh
I don't wanna be in the house, no
I don't wanna be in love
All the choices you made, would you make them again?
All the lies that you told, did you believe in them?
I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love, ooh, in love, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna be in love, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
