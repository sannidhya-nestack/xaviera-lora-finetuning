Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yeah
Oh Lord
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Woo!
She lived out in the sticks close to New Orleans
But young Gina got a head full of dreams
She took this job dancing at the Blue Kitty
Hoping one day make it big in the city she's alright
Go go go
Touching her dancing cage, she danced on the lap
The bonders called a jet and they kept coming back
One night some guy said I can make you a star
Now she's heading for the city in the back seat of his car
She's a dancing queen, the best in the city
A dancing queen, she's so pretty
A dancing queen, just living the dream
I'm talking about Jet from New Orleans, oh yeah!
Long black hair Jet
Gina called me up and said guess where I'm at
I'm dancing in Vegas, I'm riding a Cadillac
I'm working hard just to spend all my dollar
I'm living for today and et about tomorrow
I'm a dancing queen, the best in the city
A dancing queen, oh man she's so pretty
A dancing queen, just living the dream
I'm talkin'bout Jack from New Orleans, oh yeah
Oh Lord, are you there?
Now Tina got a job dancing at the Blue Kitty
Just like her ma made it big in the city now
She's dancing Vegas, a real big star
They called her ma up and said they still know who you are
You're a dancing queen, the best in the city
A dancing queen, oh man she's so pretty
A dancing queen, just living the dream
I'm talkin'bout Jeff from New Orleans, oh yeah
Woo, Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah
