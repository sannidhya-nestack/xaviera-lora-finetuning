I will never give up, give up, all these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love,'cause it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up, all this life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love, it's the biggest part of me
Life is too short to waste a second of my time
Nothing can stop me'cause I know that I'll be fine
I won't hold on to what some people think is right
it's my life and I'm not scared of all those nasty things they say
An each and every day can only make me smile
I only see the best, I'm never giving up
Don't wanna be like those who only have regrets
I love this life too much and I don't wanna fill it with the pain
I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up, all this life I have in me
I can only feel love, feel love, it's the biggest part of me
Faith is the only thing that's good enough for me
It fills me up each day, each second that I breathe
No one can give me more than faith can give to me
And I don't care if it's wrong or it's right
Because I know what is best for me
I will never give up, give up
All these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love
it's stronger than my pride
I will never give up, give up all this life I have in me
I can only feel love, still love is the biggest part of me
One more time for the masses

Jdde edde en on the microphone (ragga)
Woman me love, jump on the stage
A pretty little woman destroy your love view
Woman me love, jump on the stage
A pretty little woman destroy your love view
Everybody jump on the stage, boogie ragga
Pretty little woman destroy your love view
Dance to the rhyme, boogie down with me son
La P Red Girls, they are pretty so fun
Can you listen, microphone one check
I will never give up, give up all these dreams I have inside
I just wanna feel love, feel love'cause it's stronger than I
I will never give up, give up
All this life I have in me
I can only feel love, see love
It's the biggest part of me
I will never give up (oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
One more time, miss selector
I will never give up, give up
