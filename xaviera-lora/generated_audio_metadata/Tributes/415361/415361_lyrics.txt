Take the night if you want it, girl
It's just the waiting that's all it's taking
We'll be off at the stroke of twelve
I'm gonna try to satisfy you
Midnight to midnight
We'll stop for nothing baby
Midnight to midnight
Oh oh
Midnight to midnight
Everything will be alright
Midnight to midnight
I'll take you there
I'll take you all the way
Oh oh
To hear where you belong
Because the night time is the right time
When hearts are young and the feelings strong
Let my desire lift you higher
Midnight to midnight
We'll stop for nothing baby
Midnight to midnight
Yeah
Midnight to midnight
Everything will be alright
Midnight to midnight
I'll take you there
I'll take you all the way
Midnight to midnight
We'll keep pushing on
We'll make it last the whole night long
And long after the morning dawn
You will still be here with me, oh
If the sky should all turn to grey
It doesn't matter, really doesn't matter
We'll light the darkness and find our way
And I will guide you through the shadows
Midnight to midnight
We'll stop for nothing baby
Midnight to midnight
Midnight to midnight, we'll stop for nothing baby, midnight to midnight, yeah
Midnight to midnight, everything will be alright, midnight to midnight
