No you can't follow me, I'm going to meet the maker
Gonna wait in line to confess all of my sins
No you can't follow me, I'm going up to heaven
Gonna play some flag football with St. Peter's kids
And so long my tired bones of trying on a new change of skin
So long to politics and so long to my so called good friends
It's been a bumpy ride but I've made it up to heaven
It's like a carnival with no hidden fears
No one is growing old and no one's really bitching
Drive any car you like you don't need no keys
So long, my tired bones, I'm trying on a new change of skin
So long to traffic lights, and so long to my so-called good friends
So when your card is called to come and meet the maker
We'll smoke a cigarette and then reminisce
About our ugly days and moments of confusion
Just trying to find a place where we can fit in
So long to casualties of war and to my so called good friends
So long my tired bones of trying on a new change of skin
