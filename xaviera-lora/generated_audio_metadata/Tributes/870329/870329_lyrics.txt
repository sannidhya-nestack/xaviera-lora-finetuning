We gone, gone, we gone hit this club like
Woah, step by step I see her dangin'
Slow mo, I'm so gone
Gotta never come back (let that go)
Baby girls like that
We gone hit this club like
Woah, step by step I see her dangin', slow mo (I'm so gone)
Gotta never pull me back
Baby girls like that
Run that, run that, run that track
Just my kicks they cost a stack
My whole fit don't know'bout that
Get low, get low, jump on back
I'm the main attraction
Spittin' out acid, I'm radioactive
Around I go, I'm overlapping
You will never see me in a league of abscess
Wait one minute gotta bring it back to it
Ball like I'm Pat, you ain't true religion on me dawg
Tell the haters bow down
Take a shot from downtown
Wonder how the man do it
Take it how you want it, I'ma give it to you G-Straight
And I'm out beat, say I'm not a human being
Rollin' like Kareem, sippin' on Codeine
I lean with it, rock with it, got cold dreams
We gon' hit this club like whoa
Step by step, I see everything in slow-mo
I'm so gone, oh oh oh
Got the passion
Baby girls like that
We gon' hit this club like woah
Step by step I see her dangin' slow-mo
Girl, gotta never come back
Run that, run that, run that track
Just my kicks they cost a stack
My whole fit don't know'bout that
Get low, get low, jump on back
I'm the main attraction
Spittin' out acid, I'm radioactive
Round I go, I'm overlapping
You ain't never seen me in a league of absence
Wait one minute gotta bring it back to it
Ball like I'm Pat, you ain't true religion
On me dog, tell the hater bow down
Take a shot from downtown, wonder how the man do it
Take it how you want it, I'ma give it to Eugene
Straight and I'm out beat, say I'm not a human being
Rollin' like Kareem, sippin' on codeine
I lean with it, rock with it, got cold dreams
We gon' hit this club like whoa
Step by step, I see everything in slow mo
I'm so gone
Got the time of day
Baby girls like that
