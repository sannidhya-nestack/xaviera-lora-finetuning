A life is filled with emotion
Love and hate such devotion
Can't live without passion
Never limit or ration
Emotion seems to blind you
You should look at your heart on your sleeve
What you feel, is it real you wonder
I hope you know, you can believe
You think that you are dreaming and your feelings are pretend
Afraid of waking up and finding out you've reached the end
You think you've been this place before and here you are again
And again
It's just emotion
It's just emotion
It's an ocean in motion
Keeping you alive, it's emotion
Remember back it was sunny
Remember back when you cried
Must not et the anger
And how you swallowed your pride
You think that you are dreaming and your feelings are pretend
Afraid of waking up and finding out you've reached the end
You think you've been this place before and here you are again and again
It's just emotion, it's just emotion
It's in motion, in motion
Keeping you alive, it's in motion
Finding hearts will always be lonely
Afraid of loving, letting it in
The price they pay for what they're protecting
Never finding out'til the end
You think that you are dreaming and your feelings are pretend
Afraid of waking up and finding out you've reached the end
You think you've been displaced before and here you are again and again
It's just emotion
It's just emotion
It's an ocean in motion
Keeping you alive it's emotion
It's just emotion
It's just emotion
It's an ocean in motion
Keeping you alive it's emotion
Motion
Motion
Motion
Still motion
Still motion
Still motion
Love me now
