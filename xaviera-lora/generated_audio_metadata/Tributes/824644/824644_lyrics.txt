No, don't walk out a door
Please don't leave me that way
I can't sleep without you
I can't eat without you
No, without you
Without you
I can't be without you
I never smile without you
You're my truth, my only love
There is no life without you
Stay on my side, forever do
You're my truth
There is no life without you
Stay on the side forever do
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
