Well now the rock a twizz a half load
With some brutal lyrics we lead a big point
We coming in fat they wrestle fat like a bull
So send for the jizzer with the liquid toad
Where we go suffer we don't want go setback
Say we want go setback make a weapon they attack
When rock a twizz come they knock on them back
Say boom shaka taka and everybody have to run
We love the rock and twist a half load
With some brutal lyrics we need a pin code
We come in here fat they wrestle fat like a bull
So send for the jizzer with the liquid torch
Where we could suffer whether what goes say bad
Say what goes say bad make a weapon they attack
Where rock and twist come there's no burning back
Say boom shaka shaka everybody have a lot
Sebu, Shaka, Taka, and everybody else, we rock, no!
Say boom shaka takka and everybody happy rock, no (rock)
Well now the rock a twizz a half load
With some brutal lyrics we lead a pin code
We comin' in fat the wrestle fire carbon
So send for the jizzer with the liquid toy
Where we go suffer with our gruesome pack
Say what gruesome pack we can weapon the attack
When rock a twizz come there's no burning back
Say boom shaka takka and everybody happy rock, no
Say boom shaka takka and everybody up and run, no
Say boom shaka takka and everybody up and run, no
