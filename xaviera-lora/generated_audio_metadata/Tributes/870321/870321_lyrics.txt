I'm going out of my mind
Wake me up when I can't go outside
I've spent so long here
I don't know if I can see the light
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don’t you wanna be free
I'm going out of my mind, you lock me up, I can't break out of here
One day they'll find me, I don't know if I can see the light
It's right, leave this all behind
It's right, leave this all behind
Don't you wanna be free?
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna be free?
Don't you wanna be free?
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don’t you wanna be free (free, free, free)
Don't you wanna be free
I'm going out of my mind
