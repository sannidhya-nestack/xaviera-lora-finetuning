I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more, till I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm feeling good right now bartender can you refill my glass
Somehow I feel like this drink ain't gone be as good as my last
Matter fact bring me that whole bottle you could put it all on my tab
I'm so fucked up can't drive I'm gone need you to call me a cab
Give me something to sip on there's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on there's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on there's nothing to trip on
Give me something to sip on
They're starting to trip on me (I'm in my own song)
Give me some more,'til I've fallen down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
They keep me some mode till I'm falling down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor, oh
I'm feeling good right now bartender can you refill my glass
Somehow I feel like this drink ain't gon' be as good as my last
Matter fact bring me that whole bottle you could put it all on my tab
I'm so fucked up can't drive I'm gon' need you to call me a cab
Give me some more till I'm falling down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
I'm in my own song
Give me some more till I'm falling down
Crawling around in the middle of the dance floor
Oh
Oh
In my own song
