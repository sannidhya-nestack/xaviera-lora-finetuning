When we were young, we were a little gang
It felt so good
We were the kids, the boys in our town
Our lives lay like open cards
We fooled around, enjoying our time
No trouble in mind
And we were the kings and they were queens
Our dreams no one understood
It's good to see ya
It's good to be with ya
It's good to hear ya
My friend, it's good to see ya
It's good to be with ya
It's good to hear ya
My friend, it's good to see ya
Where years went by, directions of our life, they changed
Like the surface on the sea
I moved from town, lived another kind of life, oh
Long time no see
Once in a while, I'll take a train, my old home
It's like time is standing still and it's good to see ya
It's good to be with ya, it's good to hear ya, my friend
It's good to see ya, it's good to be with ya, it's good to hear ya
And my friend, it's good to see ya
Woah, how we live our life so apart
But when we meet it's like yesterday to me, yeah yeah
Well time goes by and I hope my friend that everything's alright
Oh it's good to see ya, it's good to be with ya
It's good to hear ya, my friend
It's good to see ya
It's good to be with ya
It's good to hear ya, my friend
It's good to see ya
It's so good to see ya
