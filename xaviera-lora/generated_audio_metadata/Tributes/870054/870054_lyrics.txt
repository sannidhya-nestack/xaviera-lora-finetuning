I don't wanna sit here all night waiting for you
Got tired of playing the fool
No more worry losing something you never had
'Cause nobody wants to be alone, alone
Tonight I escape like a bird and fly away
I will be young, wild and free
Up in the sky like eagle just fly away
Spread my wings, young, wild and free
Young, wild and free
Young, wild and free
Young, wild and free
Young, wild and free
No more worry losing something you never had
nobody wants to be alone, alone
So now I escape like a bird and fly away
I will be your wild and free
Up in the sky fly eagle just fly away
Spread my wings you're wild and free
You're wild and free
You're wild and free
You're wild and free
You're wild and free
I don't wanna sit here all night waiting for you
No more worry losing something you never had
