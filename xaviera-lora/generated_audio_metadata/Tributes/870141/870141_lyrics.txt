Uh, yah, yah, yah, check check check check check check check
We gon' break it down like this, here we go
Put your rhymes and your rhythms down to a T
Let everybody know your ability
Hardcore from door to dance floor
For sure gonna give you what you came here for
Smoking up suckas that is my thing
I got a gang of rhymes and they all down the bag
Ever see a rapper get chewed up
Body all mangled and tangled because he screwed up
Uh watch out, roof your butt and backside
My DJ on the cut now let the track ride
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check
Uh, uh
Yah, yah
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check
We gon' break it down like this
Here we go
Big Mason drum when I rock with the top knots
Bangin' and pumpin' the sound is astounding
If you suckas try to diss try to say that I'm wack
I got a gang of rhymes and they all down the back
Bring the beat back
(Yeah)
