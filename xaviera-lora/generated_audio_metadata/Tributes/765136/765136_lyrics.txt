You're telling me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're telling me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Running through my blood like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
And I need to release the energy inside me
you make my world shake
I behave like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
Tellin' me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're tellin' me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Runnin' through my blood like an animal
Like an animal
Like an animal
And I need
To release the energy inside me
you make my world change, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
