Could it be memories cut into reality?
Could it be memories cut into reality?
You gave it time instead of walking and walking on by
I changed my mind
Oh I couldn't, I couldn't deny
Mistaken lies
Forsaken ties
But time wasn't on your side
I changed my mind
Could it be memories cut into reality?
Could it be memories cut into reality?
That you gave it time instead of walking and walking on by
I've changed my mind
Ooh I couldn't, I couldn't deny
