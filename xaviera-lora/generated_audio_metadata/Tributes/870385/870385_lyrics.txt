Girl I'll tell you what you're missing
Missing my good love
You need me to open your heart
Girl I'll tell you what you're missing
Missing my good love
You need me to open your heart
I'm writing for you
Girl, you know that I'll never leave you, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl, I'll tell you what you're missing
Missing my good love
You need me to open your heart
Girl, I'll tell you what you're missing
Missing my good love
You need me to open your heart
I'll be here for you, girl
You know that I'll never leave you, oh yeah
