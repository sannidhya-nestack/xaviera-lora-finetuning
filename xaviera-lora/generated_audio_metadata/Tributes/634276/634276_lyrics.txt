Baby, I love you, you know that I do
(Baby, baby, you know that I love you)
Sometimes I can't help the things that I do
(Can't help the things that I do)
But you know that I'm trying the best I know how
(Baby, baby, you know that I love)
But even the best can't get it all perfect just now (get it all perfect just now)
Ooh baby I'm asking and I hope you don't mind
That you would give me
Oh baby just a little more time
Cause somehow
We're gonna work it out baby
Some time will be needed to work things out
Somewhere is the perfect relationship where I'm
But until then I guess it will be just you and me
I've been waiting forever to find the right one
And I never thought it could be this much fun (never thought it could be this much fun)
And in spite of our difference I know we agree (baby baby I know we agree)
That I wanna hold you as much as you do me (hold you as much as you do me)
Ooh baby I'm asking and I hope you don't mind
That you would give me, oh baby just a little more time
somehow we're gonna work it out baby
Sometime we'll be needed to work things out
Somewhere is a perfect relationship waiting
But until then I guess it will be just you and me
Ooh honey I mean it from the heart of mine
I'm crazy about you and nothing's gonna change my mind
somehow we're gonna work it out baby
Sometime we'll be needed to work things out
Somewhere is the perfect relationship we're at
But until then I guess it will be just you and me
