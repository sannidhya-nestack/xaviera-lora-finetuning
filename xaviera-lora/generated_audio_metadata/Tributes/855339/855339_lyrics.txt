Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
I could ask a million questions
That would leave me wanting more
That's why I let you do the talking
Maybe that's what talking's for
I do my best to learn to listen
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
