Well there's no questions to answer, nothing to decide
You and I both know the ropes by now, there's nothing to it
Just look into my eyes, there are no surprises here
This man loves a woman and she knows it
With a love that's real
Think it is?
No it is
No it is
I know this world can be cruel and I've seen it too
Just like you
So promise me you'll never doubt my love, dear
And I don't know what to do with you
Do you know what to do with me?
We'll shout it from the rooftops for the world to hear
See our love is real
We think it is
We know it is
Know it is
You'll find love is real
We see it is
You'll know it is, know it is (This is all I want is this)
All I want is this
I, I, I, I, I, I, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooh
We think it is, and know it is, know it is, is, all I want is this, all I want is this
