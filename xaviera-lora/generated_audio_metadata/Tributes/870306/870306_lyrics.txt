Girl it's been a while since I told you I love you and it's been a while since I made up for all the times I did you wrong
You know I get so busy and you sticking with me is something that I don't wanna et, no
And girl, I'm gonna show you how much I love you, how much I need you
I want you to know that I appreciate you sometimes, I don't know how to say it, girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, yeah

I don't know how to say it girl it's been a while
Since I told you I love you and it's been a while
Since I made up for all the times I did you wrong
You know I get so busy and you sticking with me
Is something that I don't wanna et knowing girl

How much I need you
I want you to know that I appreciate you sometimes
