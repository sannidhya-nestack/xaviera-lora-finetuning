Please just hold me, please control me
Don't let me fall when things go wrong
Please just hold me
Please don't ever leave
Just be the one, the only one
Ay, ay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Please just hold me, please control me
Don't let me fall when things go wrong
Please just hold me, please don't ever leave
Just be the one, the only one
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
