Ball some a ball while some a dem a allow
Sight dem a come pan me satellites
Ganna send a army a man fi protect we brother
Tactically place em sip on the pre-corder
Bad man a rude boy
Guard the barrier
Coaching
Ambush them with the fire
Em take place the loser
Petro pull it out ya
If we catch this iffy fussy will it get thatcher?
Now some a ball while some a dem a allah
Sight dem a come from me satellites
Cannot send a army a man to protect we brother
Tactically placed MC pattern in front of it
One man a rude boy, guard the barrier
2G ambush them with the fire wing
Take this innocent, petrol bullet thatcher
If we catch this iffy fussy will it get thatcher?
If it gets too simple for you, well, it gets tougher
If we catch this iffy fussy will it get thatcher?
Balls from a ball while some of them are allah
Sight them out and promise at a lie
Scandals inna army ya man
We protect we bother
Tactically place MCP under the covers
Bad man a road boy
Guard the barrier
OG
Ambush them with the fire beam
Take loose the noose
Catch up to the Tata
If we catch this iffy fussy will it get thatcher?
If it gets too super-fussy will it get toucha?
If it gets too super-fussy will it get toucha?
