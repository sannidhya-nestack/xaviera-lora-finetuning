Sometimes it feels like we've lost our way
And you feel that you're seeing better days
When it's hot and cold
You've got me to hold
Hold me the spark that brings you the light
When we're where at it feels sometimes strange
What we're in the night seems out of range
When the road is long
I'll keep us going strong
And we'll make it through alright
I'm a stronger man when I'm with you
Nothing but the best is gonna do
And when it's dark
Baby I'll bring the spark
The spark that'll keep us alive
Oh yeah
Spark that'll keep us alive
So come on baby, turn those lights low
Let the music play and come in real cold
When you start to doubt
Let the flames burn out
I'll be the spark that brings you light
Yeah, I'm a stronger man when I'm with you
Baby, nothing but the best is gonna do
And when it's dark, honey, I'll bring the spark
Oh, the spark that'll keep us alive
Woah, this spark of a previous life
Yeah, this spark of a previous life
