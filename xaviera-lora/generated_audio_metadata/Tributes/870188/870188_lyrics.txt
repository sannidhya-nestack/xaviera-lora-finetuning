We don't need no sleep because the party don't stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on, turn me up
We don't need no sleep because the party don’t stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on turn me up
We don't need no sleep because the party don’t stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on turn me up
We don't need no sleep because the party don'T stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me, turn me on, turn me off
Turn me, turn me, turn me, turn me on, turn me off
Ooh, yeah, yeah
We don't need no sleep because the party don't stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on, turn me up
We don't need no sleep because the party don't stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on, turn me up
Call out Cigars, glow sticks, baseball ferocious
Liquin, Pony Air like a gun up in a holster
We gone party all night, get wasted
Turn up the music, we don't care, get stupid
We don't need no sleep because the party don't stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on, turn me up
We don't need no sleep because the party don't stop
So put your hands on me and turn me on, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me on, turn me up
