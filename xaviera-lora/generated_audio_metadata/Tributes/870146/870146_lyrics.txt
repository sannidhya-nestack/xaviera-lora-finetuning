I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
The smell is bringing back the memories
The ones locked deep within
But it's too late now, I remember every scene
But it's too late now, I remember you and me
And how careless we could be
And how careless we could be
And how careless we could be
I can feel the rain upon my skin
It covers everything
The smell is bringing back the memories
The ones locked deep within
But it's too late now, I remember every scene
But it's too late now, I remember you and me
And how careless we could be
And how careless we could be
How careless we could be
