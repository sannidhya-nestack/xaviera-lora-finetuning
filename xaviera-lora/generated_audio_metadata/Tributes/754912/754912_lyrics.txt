Your girl, your girl
She rules your world
I can't understand
Why you're her man
If you let me try I will make you mine
Love you all the time'til it's over
We could run away, we could leave today
If you want to stay then it's okay
Then it's okay
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
We could take a chance, we could be more than friends
You should be my love, you should be my love
Your girl, your girl
She rules your world
You don't seem to mind how
She treats you all the time
Baby can't you see you should be with me
our chemistry is amazing
I want you to know our love can grow
I won't let you go
I could be the one for you
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
We could take a chance, we could be more than friends
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love
You should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
We could take a chance, we could be more than friends
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
You should be my love, you should be my love
We could take a chance
We could be more than friends
You should be my love, you should be my love
