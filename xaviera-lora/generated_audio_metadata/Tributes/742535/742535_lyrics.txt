The wind is howling and the duck is barking
But it doesn't matter to me
I'm reading the paper in my lazy chair
And the radio plays my favorite tune
Ooh, I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so fine
The rain is falling against my window pane
But I'm sitting here warm and dry
You are busy with your daily things
And tell me that you're happy with me
Ooh, I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so fine
On a lazy, lazy Sunday
It's my lazy Sunday
Ooh, yeah, it's Sunday
A lazy, lazy Sunday afternoon
A week from working has come to an end
And I feel I deserve my rest
No more phone calls, no more driving in my car
Yeah, this is heaven on earth
Ooh, I feel so good
Yeah, I feel so fine
On a lazy, lazy Sunday
It's my lazy Sunday
Ooh yeah, it's Sunday
A lazy, lazy Sunday afternoon
Lazy, lazy Sunday
It's my lazy Sunday
Ooh yeah, it's Sunday
Lazy, lazy Sunday
Lazy, lazy Sunday
It's my lazy Sunday, ooh yeah, it's Sunday
