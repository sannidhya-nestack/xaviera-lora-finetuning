Tell me what you know'bout it, what you know'bout it, what you know about it
What you know'bout it? (hey, hey)
Tell me what you know'bout it? (tell me what you know)
Quentin officer, why me do a flat like a raft?

If you never have your gun, me dah tell you chuckass
This is where I'm always gonna go
Grinding 24-hour
I promise I ain't never stopping
Tell me what you know about it

A niggz head bust like a cock
Another ghetto youth inna blood like a chalk
You and your niggz drinking gunk a cock
You just killed seven inna Rumba Rala
What you know about it
What you know'bout it?

Tell me what you know'bout it?
What you know'bout it?

What you know'bout it?
Tell me what you know'bout it?
