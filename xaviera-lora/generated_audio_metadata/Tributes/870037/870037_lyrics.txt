I went to Africa, Mama Africa, I met a cured girl
Beautiful like pearl
We fell in love
So deep in love
When I look into her eyes
I see paradise
You are my paradise
I can't deny
You make me high
You are my paradise
I can't deny
You make me high
Together we go to a city where there's no pain
Pepponi take me away
Love is forever with you and me no shame
Pepponi
Drende let's go
Pepponi paradise
Drende let's go
Pepponi
Paradise
There wouldn't be no goodbye
It's no surprise
I'm hypnotized
There wouldn't be no goodbye
I'm hypnotized
So
Let
Together we go to a city where there's no pain
People need
Take me away
The love is forever with you, I mean no shame
Beponi
I went to Africa
Mama Africa
A maracure girl
Beautiful like pearl
We fell in love
So deep in love
When I look into her eyes
I see paradise
