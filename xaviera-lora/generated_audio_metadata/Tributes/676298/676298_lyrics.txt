Tellin' me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're tellin' me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Runnin' through my blood like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
I need to release the energy inside me
you make
My world shake, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal
Tellin' me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're tellin' me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Runnin' through my blood like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
I need to release the energy inside me
you make my world shake
I behave like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
