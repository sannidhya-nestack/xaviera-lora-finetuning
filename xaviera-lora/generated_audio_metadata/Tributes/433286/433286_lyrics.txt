I've been to Tokyo, I've been to New Orleans
I've been to Tokyo, I've been to New Orleans
Ah yeah, Jambalaya, gumbo and sushi
I was born in the country, raised in London town
I was born in the country, raised in London town
With my head in the clouds, feet up right here on the ground
Live with three different women
I've loved so many more
Live with three different women
Loved so many more
I got the strangest feeling
Won't see number four
I'm here
Well if I should die, I'd die satisfied
If I should die in the morning
I'd die satisfied
With my lip on woman and my guitar by my side
G-O-K, G-O-K, wow
I said G-O-K, G-O-K wow
One of these old days, going back to Tokyo
(laughing)
