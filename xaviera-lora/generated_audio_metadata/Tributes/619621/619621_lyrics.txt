Hope it's not too late for me to call
I know I shouldn't ask you at all
But I feel a cold wind down to my shoes
Are you feeling it too?
We can just cuddle
Talk all night long
We won't be doing anything wrong
You be the kindle
I'll be the lighter
We'll warm each other with pure desire
Don't hesitate, baby, it's not too late
Let's start a fire
Maybe there's no times, no there's no catch
We may discover we're the perfect match
Don't make me wait
Baby it's not too late
Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire
