Whatever the future will may bring
I'll take you to the next level
We're gonna feel like in heaven
Now I'm gonna save you all my love for her
Oh baby keep on believing it's true
I know a girl and she is my lady
I never seen a woman like her before
And now I know whenever she is lonely
I get the chance to find a way to her heart
Every day this love is getting stronger
We'll keep on going'til the end of time
And all the time when I'm not with her
I keep thinking of her and feeling I miss her
Now I'm gonna save my love for her
Oh baby keep believing it's true
I'll keep believing that's what I'll learn
At the end we'll still keep on finding
I know a girl and she's my lady
I've never seen a woman like her before
And now I know whenever she is lonely
I get the chance to find a way to her heart
Whatever the future will may bring
I'll take you to the next level
We're gonna feel like in heaven
Now I'm gonna save you all my love for her
Oh baby keep on believing it's true
I know a girl and she is my lady
I never seen a woman like her before
And now I know whenever she is lonely
I get the chance to find a way to her heart
Every day this love is getting stronger, huh?
We'll keep on going'til the end of time
And all the time when I'm not with her
I keep thinking of her and feel I miss her
I know a girl and she's my lady
I never seen a woman like her before
And now I know
Whenever she is lonely
I get the chance to find a way to her heart
