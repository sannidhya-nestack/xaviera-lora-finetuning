I know you want it, you can't say no
You're all up on it, so just let go
You want my body, head to toe
I know you want it, you can't say no
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I know you want it
You can't say no
You're all up on it
So just let go
You want my body
Head to toe
I know you want it
You can't say no, I know you want it
You can't say no, you're all up on it
So just let go, you want my body
Head to toe
I know you want it
You can't say no
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna tell you baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
I ain't gonna take it baby
