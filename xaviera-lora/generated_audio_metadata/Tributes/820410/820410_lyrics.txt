Oh, my love, I'm so far from the straight line
I'm schooled on wasted time
You wanna come with me
But when the sun gets low, the town gets higher
Think they'll find a way of my mind and leave it behind
I wanna leave it behind
I, I've been searching for a highway tonight
And I, headed straight into the old world
Sky come with me
Love, we're gonna take home
What we're reaching for
You
Oh I'm reaching home now
Oh my love I'm so far from the finish line
I'm schooled it's wasted life
You won't run with me
Hey, won't miss us till morning, but I'm thinking about them
We'll be a few hundred miles between us and them
They'll search for us, darling, we won't be home
They'll call your name, baby, but don't pick up the phone
I, I've been searching for a highway tonight
And I'm headed straight into the old sky, come with me
We're gonna take hold
What we're reaching for
Ooh
I wanna look you in the eyes and know that the man you see
Standing in front of you tonight is the one I was born to be
Born to be love, come with me
'Cause I, I'm searching for a highway tonight
And oh, head straight into the old, sky come with me
And oh, we're gonna take hold, we're reaching for home
Who
Are we reaching for now
Are we reaching for
