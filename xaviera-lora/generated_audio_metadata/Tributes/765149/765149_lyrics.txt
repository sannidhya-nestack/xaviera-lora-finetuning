Tellin' me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're tellin' me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Runnin' through my blood like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Tellin' me to breathe but I can't catch a breath
You're tellin' me to sleep but I can't bear to rest
Runnin' through my blood like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
And I need to release the energy inside me'cause you make
My world changed, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Getting turns of gold when you touch me
My heart can't unfold when you kiss me
I'm losing control like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal
And I need to release the energy inside me
you make my world change, I behave
Like an animal, like an animal, like an animal
Like an animal, like an animal, like an
Now I know, now I know, now I know, now I know
Making me lose control
You're making me lose control
You're making me lose control
You're making me lose control
You're making me lose control
You're making me lose control
You made me a don't you? Me a don'ty? A don't don't don't you?
You made me a don't you? Me a donkey? A don't don't don't you?
