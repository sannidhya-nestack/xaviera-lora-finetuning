I can't wait much longer, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got a stuffy room upstairs, not much of a view
And the only pretty thing in sight is a picture of you
I got a perfume that are you scent can't get you out of my mind
We got three thousand miles between us and just telephone line
But I can't wait much longer
This feeling's getting stronger
In my head I can hear you say
As this won't last forever
Soon we'll be back together
If I'm out of sight every day (I can't wait)
Well I stare at your picture and wish I could make you appear
Look in my heart, you're in my head, but you're not here
And these sleepless nights apart, they won't leave me alone
And the calendar counts the days that go so slow
And I can't wait much longer
This feeling's getting stronger
In my ear I can hear you say
Yes, this won't last forever
Soon we'll be back together
With time on our side every day (I can't wait)
Bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Girl, I can't wait much longer
This feeling's getting stronger
In my head I can hear you say
Bet this won't last forever
Soon we'll be back together
With time on our side every day (I can't wait)
(I can't wait much longer)
