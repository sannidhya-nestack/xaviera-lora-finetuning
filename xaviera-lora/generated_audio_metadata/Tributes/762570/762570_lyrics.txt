Jada the control, universal, field marshal and a partial who play double wise selection
Afiske on to this your baseline we go rap papapapa
Don Galleta sing and Dillinger chat, boom shot, heya
Children of Israel take heed
And listen to the words of the prophet
Children of Israel, take heed
And listen to the words of the Prophet
(I'm Israel, everybody)
Children of Israel
The children of Israel take heed
And listen to the words of the Prophet
The children of Israel take heed
And listen to the words of the Prophet
The children of Israel take heed
Children of Israel
Children of Israel
Take heed
