Find me in a place you should not be
Under the moonlit sky
Chase me late into the night
This could be suicide
Push me deep beneath your skin
Let me ride inside your heart
Take me down, drink me in
Take me, I'm your medicine
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Find me in a place you should not be
Under the moonlit sky
Chase me late into the night
This could be suicide
Urge me deep beneath your skin
Let me ride inside your heart
Take me down drink me in
Take me I'm your medicine
Ah, ah, ah
