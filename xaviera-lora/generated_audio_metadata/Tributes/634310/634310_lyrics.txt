You and I have never been apart
Dear brother, I want you to know that I've loved you from the start
And brother, please know that I have tried with all my might
To listen to your troubles even when it took all night
And these times are a jewel to me that I'll hold within my heart
They are a light unto my path
And brother please hear these words
Let them ring within your heart
Let them be a light to you
When you think you're in the dark
My brother, my brother, our love fell through the years
My brother's laughter that can wipe away my tears
Through trials or through troubles our love may fall
It will always return'cause a brother's love will last it all
There are paths before us, whether welcome or unkind
Brother, know I'm by your side at any sudden time
Near the undetermined memories still held in heaven's hand
I will be awaiting something greater for your plan
They will be a jewel to me that I'll hold within my heart
There'll be a light unto my path
Brother please hear these words
Let them ring within your heart
Let them be a light to you
When you think you're in the dark
My brother, my brother, a love that through the years
My brother's laughter that can wipe away my tears
Through trials or through troubles our love may fall
It will always return'cause a brother's love will last it all
And these times are a jewel to me that I'll hold within my heart
They are a light unto my path
My brother, my brother, a love that through the years
My brother's laughter that can wipe away my tears
Through trials or through troubles our love may fall
It will always return
a brother's love will last it all
