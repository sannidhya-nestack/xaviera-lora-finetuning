Yes camouflage, what happened to them?
Dem system is a fraud, me brethren
A true sabba dem good still but me nah like bad officer
Box up your mother, lock your inner self in a spliffy piece of grabba
Disappear abrapadabra, no, play my backstabba
Grabbin' up a ring, I want to climb in up the ladder
High man not like police, grass stand not like police
High man not like police, grass stand not like police
Why me do a flat like a raft
Me baby dey a sit and knock off with jazz
No tell me no move cause we nah play draft
If you never have your gun
Me dah tell you chuck off
Fuck your brother
Box up your mother
Lock your inner self in a spliffy piece of grabba
This a feel a bra-fada-bra
No, I play my backstabba
Grabbin' a barrel now while you're climbing up the ladder
I'm a nah like bully (never man, never)
Rasta nah like bully (weh, weh, weh, weh, weh, weh)
I'm a nah like bully (never man, never)
Rasta nah like bully (weh, weh, weh, weh, weh, weh)
Yes, camouflage
