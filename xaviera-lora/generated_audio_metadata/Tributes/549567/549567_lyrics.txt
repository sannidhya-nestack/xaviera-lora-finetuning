Every night I dream about the ocean
Takes me home where I belong
My mind needs the ocean as emotion
Rolling waves carry me a long way down
Every night I dream about the country
Takes me home where I belong
My soul needs the fields of grass and flowers
Country roads carry me along
Every night I dream about the night sky
Takes me home where I belong
My eyes need the stars to keep me grounded
The universe carries me long way down
Every night I dream about September
Takes me home where I belong
My lungs need the autumn air's elation
Falling leaves carry me along
Every night I dream about your warm smile
Takes me home where I belong
My heart needs your morning air and bright eyes
Hope and love carry me a long way down
