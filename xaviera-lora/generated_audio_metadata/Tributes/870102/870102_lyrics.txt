Could it be memories cut into reality?
Could it be memories cut into reality?
You gave it time instead of walking and walking by
I changed my mind
Oh I couldn't, I couldn't deny
Mistaken lies
Forsaken ties
But time wasn't on your side
You gave it time
You gave it time, instead of walking and walking on by
I changed my mind, oh I couldn't, I couldn't deny
Mistaken lies, forsaken ties
But time wasn't on your side
You gave it time
Whip whip ring the bass tone now
