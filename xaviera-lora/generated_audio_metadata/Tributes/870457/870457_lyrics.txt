You make me feel so sensitive
It's like a piece of heaven
You make me feel so perfectly
Never felt much better, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You make me feel so sensitive
It's like a breeze of heaven
You make me feel so perfectly
Never felt much better
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, ay, yeah, ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, ay, yeah, ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
