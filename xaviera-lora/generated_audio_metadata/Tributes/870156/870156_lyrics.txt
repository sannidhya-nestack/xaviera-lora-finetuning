If I were to stay in here forever (no)
I would want the sun to come alive
If my heart was lighter than a feather (no)
I would slip away into the night
Send me ultraviolet signals through the silence
Into the horizon, elevate
Yeah!
Elevate
Elevate
Rise, rise
Rise, rise
Will we travel through the night?
Never leave my side
Take me on a ride
I'll try not to close my eyes
If I were to stay in here forever
I would want the sun to come alive
If my heart was lighter than a feather
I would slip away into the night
Send me ultraviolet
Signals through the silence
Into the horizon
Elevate
Elevate
Elevate
Elevate
