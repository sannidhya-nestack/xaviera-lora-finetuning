Shawty, I can't do this no more (I know what's really good)
See, I'm stuck in my past
And I'm thinkin'bout what I would've had
Shawty got me like, "Oh, oh, oh"
And now I'm missin' you, baby (oh, oh)
We went down the wrong road (and my heart's so cold)
But my life unfroze (unfroze)
I know I shouldn't never let go
Shawty, I can't do this no more (I don't know which way to go)
See, I'm stuck in my past
And I'm thinkin'bout what I would've had
Shawty got me like, "Oh" (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And now I'm missin' you, baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We went down the wrong road (Now my heart's so cold)
But my life unfroze (Froze, froze, froze)
I know I'm tryna never let go (Never let go)
And now I'm missing you baby
We went down the wrong road
And my heart's so cold
Oh my life's on the froze
I know I should've never let go
