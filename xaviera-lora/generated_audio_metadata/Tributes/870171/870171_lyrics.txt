Uh, uh, uh, uh
Black and white and black
Black and white and black
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
Uh, it's no tellin' how I'm gettin' by
Shoulda been a Fuji, how I got the whole city high
Cold K music, crack music addict
Now my whole city got a true passion habit
Group B to home base, permanent tick
Put the women on my arm on an automatic rotate
Shot'em like a Rolex, doin' what they project
Homework out so I use'em as a Bowflex
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya, I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya, I'm gonna show ya how we do it
Rotch, it's only if you ot
It don't take a lot of nothing just to blow up the spot
You can find me on the avenue or even the block
Sippin' on a 40, pimpin' in the public parking lot
Guarantee we got more flow, smoke more weed
Got Geico to ensure we stay high
Bare shoot you like they Bonnie and Clyde
Hold up, my flow nuts, y'all kids is lazy and bogus
But your baby ass is, did they grow up?
Quit complaining and get your dough up
Back to the task at hand, you know the shit I do so well if I got them waving they hands
Like we want more, supply and demand
Till I go off and they love it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
I'm gonna do something for ya
I'm gonna show ya how we do it
