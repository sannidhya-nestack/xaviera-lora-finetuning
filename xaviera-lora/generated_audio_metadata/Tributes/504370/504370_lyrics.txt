Alone and staring into darkness one last night
I'm headed to the place where love is in plain sight
I'll leave this road behind
I'm on my way home where I finally know
I want to be
And now I can see that your love was just too good for me
But you waited for me to see
Oh you waited for me to see
I'm on my way but every hour seems like a year
I couldn't breathe when you said
I want you near
And now the past will disappear
I'm on my way home where I
And now I can see that your love was just too good for me
But you waited for me to see
And you never know how we will go
So hold close to love and never let go yeah yeah yeah
Woah, woah, woah
I'm on my way home where I finally know
I want to be
And now I can see that your love was just too good for me
But you waited for me to see
Yes you waited for me to see
Oh, you waited for me
