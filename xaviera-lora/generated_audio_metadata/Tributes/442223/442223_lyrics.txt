Yeah
Have you ever felt like you're flying
And nothing stands in between you and heaven
Have you ever thought of being up there
And feeling like a God
Trust me babe, it's all because of you
Don't make me sad and blue
all I wanna do
I just wanna fly with you
Baby I'll sure get high with you
With all precious love I would die for you
Whatever people say
All I want is to fly with you
Baby I'm going high with you
And just the next moment I'll die for you
Whatever people say
Oh yeah!
Trust me babe, it's all because of you
Don't make me sad and blue
all I wanna do
I just wanna fly with you
Baby I'll sure get high with you
With all precious love I would die for you
Whatever people say
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, I just wanna fly with you
Baby I'll show you, fly with you
With all precious love I would die for you
Whatever people say
All I want is to fly with you
Oh baby I'm going (fly with you)
And just the next moment I'll die for you
Whatever people say
