Lately I haven't been myself
I feel like someone else
Look closely and you will see
I'm not the guy that I used to be
You can't talk to me
Don't knock upon my door
You can't talk to me
Don't come around no more
For you I might be just the same
Believe it when I say I change
There's no need to raise a fuss
Don't even try to stay in touch
Can't talk to me
Don't knock upon my door
You can't talk to me
Don't come around no more
Don't worry more
I'm alright
Goodbye now
I really got to go
If I lay in bed all day
Just to pass the time away
Or if I stay out all night
No need to ask if it's alright
Then talk to me
Look back upon my door
You can talk to me
Don't come around no more
