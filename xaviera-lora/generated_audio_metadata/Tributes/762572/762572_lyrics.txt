To big up Don Goliath and all the massive in crew
To the world
International, out-o-national and back again
Bass gone global
More bass in the place
It goes to ADX
Ramlands DJ
They really love it
They really love it
Love I love I love the sound
Of the 808 coming down
Free flying, wind will try and
Music is so right
In the city tonight
Bass sound, but they bumping down the day they lie
They really love it
They really love it

They really love it
