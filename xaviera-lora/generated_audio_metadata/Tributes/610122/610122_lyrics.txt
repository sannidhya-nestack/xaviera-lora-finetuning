I'm watching while you're dreaming
Can you reach the show?
I'm living off your feelings
Never mind my own
And every single step I take
Makes me more sure
Which ever road I take
Leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
Know that I can't hide
I'm wondering who you're seeing
Underneath your lids
Calling out the hidden
Never mind what's real
Funny I should smile again
To you within
Funny I should smile again
Leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
Know that I can't hide
Leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
Know that I can't hide
Funny I should smile again to you within
Whichever road I take
Leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
It leads back into your arms
Oh, it leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
Know that I can't hide
Leads back into your arms
Leads back into your
Leads back into your arms
Know that I can't hide
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Back into your arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Back into your arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Back into your arms
Leads back into your arms
