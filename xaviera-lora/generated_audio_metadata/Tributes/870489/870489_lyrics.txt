I could always be the one you wanna call when it's cold outside
I will always be the one that's right here standing by your side
Open up your heart and let me in
I promise not to break you
I promise I'll be all
All that you want
So let me in
In my heart before
Let me in
Oh
Explodes our hearts in blood
Your love explodes our hearts in blood
I could always be the one you wanna call when it's cold outside
I will always be the one that's right here standing by your side
Open up your heart and let me in
I promise not to break you
I promise I'll be all
All that you want
Catch me now
I can't leave
Hold me now
I'm yours now I believe
Soon let me in
Fill my heart with hope
Let me in
Oh oh
Explodes our hearts in blooms (your love)
Explodes our hearts in blooms
