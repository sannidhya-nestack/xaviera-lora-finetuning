The moon was just right, for us to fall in love that night
It couldn't be more perfect and I knew it must be written in the stars and your eyes
I saw it written in your eyes, now I need you tonight
There's nothing else can make it right
But there's so much that keeps us from each other
Sometimes I think I'll lose my mind
Oh girl, I need you to be mine tonight
Moonlight pebbles, the smell of your perfume
Second meeting
Love you more I do
To get through the day
We play the games we have to play
Swimming underwater
Holding breathless surface
Slipping out of sight
Oh girl
I need you to be mine tonight
Moonlight, pebbles, the smell of your perfume
Second meeting, love you more, it's true
Yeah, we got our lives so full that we can't find the time
But if our worlds are destined to be joined forever from that magic night
Then why, then why can't you be mine tonight?
Oh then why, then why can't you be mine tonight
