Why is this so confusing?
Why am I so unsure?
Games are fun and all but I'm scared
This one's more like war
Does any of this really matter?
I'm kind of ugly and insecure
This dance feels like a nightmare
For some strange reason I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more, I want more, I want more
I want more, I want more
Kiss me or kill me girl my heart can't take this
Been down this road too many times before
I keep telling myself give it up boy you don't stand a chance
But I'm addicted and I want more
I want more
I want more
