Everybody wanna light you bright
Take your mind to sonic
Everybody wanna light you great
You shock me god haunted
And the color you like
Ever circles you while
Every minute you waste
Any colour you like
Any thoughts that you mind
Any future you have
Love is the answer
Any habits you have
Any wonder you blame
Every color you like
Love is the answer
Everybody wants like you have
I'm a supersonic
Joking like you are like you when
You take me high honey
Don't you ever reply
Every second you might
Any wonder you wait
Any habits you have
Any show can you bring
Any color you like
Love is the answer
Any habits you have
Any wonder you bring
And the color you like, life is the answer
