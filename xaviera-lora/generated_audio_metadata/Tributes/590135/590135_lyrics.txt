And when I, I feel your heart beating
And all my post quickens just knowin' that heart beats for me
The sun goes down and you can feel me coming
Oh I can take you away from the heart achin'
Oh, I can't stop now
It's who I am
So turn around
And won't you take my hand
The choice is yours
So think it through
Just don't take too much time
Or time might take you
Yeah, from now on, we'll be forever
Yeah, forever a part of the family this blood runs through
Make it dry for all its worth
And they can chase us around the world
But they're never gonna get in between you and me
Yeah, we can't stop now
It's who we are
We won't give in
Oh, no, we've come too far
Oh, they want our heads
So full of hate
At least we're not alone
Oh, is this storm the case?
