But we need to talk, that's all she had to say
Why is this so hard, why today?
Found out who your friends are, trust me you'll survive
It's all for the best, and this is life
This is life, this is freedom
Say goodbye, learn a lesson, we're moving on
You'll soon realize this is just the beginning
The day after is always the worst
It only gets better, trust me you'll see
Be strong and believe
Be strong and believe
This is life, this is freedom
Say goodbye, learn a lesson, we're moving on
Here we go, one more time
The curtains up, I can see the lights
Another week, and another day
And here we are, laughing away
Float along,'cause it's a ride
Nothing to our names, we're out of sight
This is life, this is freedom
We're moving on
This is life
This is freedom
Say goodbye
Learn a lesson
We're moving on
