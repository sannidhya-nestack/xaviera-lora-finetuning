I'm touched, you wrote
And I understand
These words leave hope
In my empty hands
When you look my way
I won't be in disguise
My old soul smile remains
Same old me from the other side
And so I'll wait for you there
I'll wait for you there
I'll wait for you there
I'll meet you there
And I'll meet you there
And I'll meet you there
It'll meet you there, it'll meet you there, it'll meet you there (I'll wait for you there, I'll wait for you there)
And I'll meet you there
And I'll meet you there
