I'm not gonna run to you tonight
I'm just gonna make my way to the city lights
Where my heart can beat with the nightlife
Where are we going?
And where are we going? And where are you going? Where are we going? And where are we going? And where are you going? Where are we going? And where are we going?
And where are you going?
I run, I walk, I'll find my way
I'll search the night, give my heart away
Where are you going?
And where are you going?
And where am I going?
I'll run, I'll walk, I'll find my way
I'll search the night, keep my heart away
Where are you going?
And where are you going?
And where am I going?
And where are you going?
