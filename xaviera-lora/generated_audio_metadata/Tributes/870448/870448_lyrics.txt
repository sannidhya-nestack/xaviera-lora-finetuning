Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh -oh-oh-oh
If I climb this mountain
If I scale this wall
If I fight my shadow
Can I lose at all
If I don't look down
Then I won't fall
If I face my fears
I could have it all
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
In the dark, in the light
I won't lose this will to fight
I'm in front, I'm inside
I can leave them all behind
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
