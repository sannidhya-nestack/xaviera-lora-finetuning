Know everything can go as you planned
Sometimes something easy get insane, insane
Don't say it's wrong
And hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me

Everything can go as planned
Sometimes something easy get insane, insane
Don't say it's wrong
And hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me
Insane, you know everything can go as planned
Sometimes something easy get insane
Insane, don't say it's wrong
And hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me, hurry to judge me
Insane
