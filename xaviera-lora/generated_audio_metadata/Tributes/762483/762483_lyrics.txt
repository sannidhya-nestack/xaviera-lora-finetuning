Now hear this
Governamente is trapping the system
Babylon one more time and you'll see
Regrets for the cool and the good system
Rise up, rise up and you'll see
Oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Eyes up, your eyes up and down the street
Now hear this
(Now hear this)
Oh yeah
Woah woah woah woah eh eh eh eh
Tell all of my sedem coliseum to the champion sound room tone
Woah woah woah woah eh eh eh eh eh
Governament is trapping the system
Babylon one more time and you'll see
Regrets for the cool and the good system
Rise up rise up and down you'll see
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh eh eh eh eh eh
Rise up rise up and down you'll see
Now hear this
(baby laughing)
Rise up, rise up and then you'll see
