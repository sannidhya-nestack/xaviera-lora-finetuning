Sailing away, it's time to save the day
Nothing to say, I know you want me to stay
You had me with goodbye, now I'm just chasing the sky
Chasing the sky
Full speed ahead
Isn't I supposed to rain?
Something you said, it sounded so inane
I know you meant to say
Something more in a different way
In a different way
Here comes the rain despite the weather man
This is insane I'm doing the best that I can
You used to be like me
Storm clouds are wild and free
Wild and free
Sailin' away, it's time to sail away
I'm breaking the chains, you know I wanted to stay
You had me with goodbye, now I'm just chasing the sky
Chasing the sky, chasing the sky
