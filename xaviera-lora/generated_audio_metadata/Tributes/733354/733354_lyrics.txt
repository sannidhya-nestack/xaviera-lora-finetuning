I took it hard
When that door closed
Too many years on my bones
To be standing all alone
But summer comes
It brings that new dawn
And over those rolling hills
I found my pot of gold
Yes, old lady down the river
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
It's only down the river
I got no place to hide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
I thank you for the favour you took away those chains
Wishing you a good life girl and a man that pulls your way
You took your chances through caution to the wind
It made us change our ways we're better now these days
It's all me down the river
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
It's all me down the river
I got no place to hide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
Oh, yeah
It's so clear down the river
It's so clear down the river
But summer comes, it brings that new dawn
And over those rolling hills, I found my pot of gold
It's all me down the river
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
It's all me down the river
I got no place to hide
I'm bending with the wind now
Got mountains still to climb
You saw me down the river
You saw me down the river
