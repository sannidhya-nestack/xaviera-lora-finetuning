Everybody knows, but what they don't know
Is what we stand for
Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money (get it, get it)
Everybody knows, but what they don't know
It's what we stand for
Get money, get money, get money, get it
My pockets stay extended
I'm riding around and getting it
You already know the business
The whole world gonna feel this
I'm OG, I'm new to the game
That OG, sooth all the pain
My kicks crisp, never seen rain
Roll it up, smoke it up straight to the brain
Everybody knows
But what they don't know
It's what we stand for
Get money, get money, get money, get it
Hop in the bottle we throw, look at her dropping it low
Took me a minute to comprehend what I was looking at
Working that body I'm bout to explode
Throwing up racks, fuck it I'm throwing up racks
Leaving a trail of that paper to cover my tracks
Shouting you coming up fast, show me what come of that ass yeah
Rolling the dro, rolling the dro
High in the clouds I stay in the zone
Keep it home grown, money I'm blown
If it ain't on the loud I'm on my way home
Get up and go, everyone knows that I am the best
I am a pro
Got clothes and fresh kicks and all I got is fresh shit
Everybody knows but what they don't know
Is what we stand for
Get money, get money, get money, get it
Everybody knows but what they don't know
Is what we stand for
Get money, get money, get money, get it
