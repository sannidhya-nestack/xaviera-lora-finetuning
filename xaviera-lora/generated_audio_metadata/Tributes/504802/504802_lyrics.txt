You twirl your hair and glance my way
I wander over our blase
We go playin' that love game again
I laugh it catches your attention
You smile it raises my suspicion
That we will play this love game again
If our hearts burn we may learn a brand new set of rules
But till that day we're here to play this love game for two
You stand shakin' your tail feather
I go kissin' on another
We go playin' that love game again
I shake that tail feather
If our hearts burn we may learn a brand new set of rules
But till that day we're here to play this love game for two
You stand shaking your tail feather
I go kissing on another
We go playing that love game
We go playing that love game
We go playing that love game again
