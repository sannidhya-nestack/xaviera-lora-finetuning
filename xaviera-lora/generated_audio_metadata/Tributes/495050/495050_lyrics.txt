If we fall, would we notice?
If it ends, would we care?
Do we go on, so cold?
It's alright to be scared
And you say that you're all messed up
And you can't go back anymore
And I say that we're all messed up
One way or another and I'm sure
That it's okay
Will these hearts love again?
Will this numbness ever fade?
We'll fade, let us fall again
I'm starting to miss the pain
And you say
That you're all messed up and you can't go back anymore
And I say
That we're all messed up one way or another and I'm sure
That it's okay to say
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken
I'm broken
If we fall, would we notice?
