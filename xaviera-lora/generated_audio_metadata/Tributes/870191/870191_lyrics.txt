You look away
But my eyes wanna stay
Keep it at bay
I try but I can't obey
These rules I made for myself
To keep me from getting hurt
These rules I made for myself
Just make it worse
Just, just make it worse
Just, make us, us, make us, us, make us, you lack
Away, but my eyes wanna stay
Keep it at bay, I try but I can't obey
These rules I've made for myself
To keep me from getting hurt
These rules I've made for myself
Just make it worse
Just, just make it worse
Just, just make, just, just make, just, just make it worse
