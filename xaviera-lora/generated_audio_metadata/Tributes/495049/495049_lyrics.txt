Morning sunshine how's your day
Hamster boy is on his way
The sun is shining bright
Love this morning light
Can't wait to see your smiling face
And I'd hang with you everyday
How I love days like today
And days where we just lounge away
Can dissect in songs, movie marathons
Dinner for two by eight
And I hang with you every day
And I hang with you every day
And there's no other place that I would rather be
Right here right now it's just you and me
And there's so many things we still have to do
In the meantime I'm fine lying here with you
How I love your laid-back style
Let's just lie here for a while
Underneath these trees
Talking philosophy
Every time I see a squirrel I smile
And I hang with you every day
And I'd climb a tree with you any day
And I'd hang with you every day
Morning sunshine how's your day?
Hamsterboy is on his way
