You used to be so funny when you acted like a fool
You made a lot of jokes and I thought you were pretty cool
We had a lot of moments that I appreciate
We just recorded a song that sounded really great
It's been a lot of years that I know you from my heart
Now we sing together and we never have a part
I try to prove to you that my love is also true
I'm giving all my heart and oh yeah I love you too
Who you love is who you love
Always stay the one I'm thinking of
Giving love straight from the heart
You might be lonely when you're out without me on the road
I'm gonna get to you when it hits me all alone
You are my loving heart
I knew that from the start
You are a pretty girl and life is making you hot
Love who you love
Who you really care about
Who you love is who you love
Always stay the one I'm thinking of
Giving love straight from the heart
The way you touch me is paradise
The way you look is dynamite
Who I love is perfect
Who you love is worth it
Who you love is who you love
Always stay the one I'm thinking of
Giving love
From the heart
Who you love is who you love
Always stay the one I'm thinking of
Giving love straight from the heart
