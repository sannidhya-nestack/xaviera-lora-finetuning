She's running out of whiskey
She's running out of time
She plays me like a G string
Says baby you're doing just fine
She's painting with her lipstick
She's painting ruby red
She's floating in the sleep stream
Since baby you were better off dead
Fade to black, fade to black
Fade to black, fade to black
Play the black
Play the black
Play the black
Play the black
She's running out of whiskey
She's running out of time
She plays me like a G string
'Cause baby you're doing just fine
She's painting with her lipstick
She's painting you red
She's floating in the sweet dream
baby you were better off dead
Fade to black
Fade to black
Play the black
Play the black
