Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, mm
Lately
You've been getting me down, getting me down, baby
I'm just a thorn in your crown, a thorn in your crown
If you leave
I will be just fine, be just fine
In the beat, I can get so high, get so high
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
(Humming)
Lately
You've been getting me down
Getting me down
Baby
I'm just a thorn in your crown
Thorn in your crown
If you leave
I will be just fine
Be just fine
In the beat
I can get so high
Get so high
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Day after day
