They don't wanna see you win (see you win)
Them haters rather see you fall (see you fall)
But see I'm getting money, man
And now I got'em rooting for the underdog (yeah, underdog, underdog, underdog, underdog)
Yeah, I got'em rooting for the underdog (underdog, underdog)
Underdog, that's right I got'em bootin' for the underdog
They don't wanna see you win
Them haters rather see you fall
But see I'm gettin' money, man
And now I got'em bootin' for the underdog
Underdog, yeah I got'em bootin' for the underdogs
Underdog, that's right I gotta move it for the underdog
Jointin's in the gold chain, livin' it up
Pins saggin', gold grills, livin', trillin' the cup
Dreams gotta follow mine
Swimmin' in the money, squeeze me duck
Seein' dollar signs, all I know is gotta grind
Pull up in a portion
Cisco rings just like Jordan
And Cisco rings yeah I'm sporting
Yo chick on me so take caution
We getting cash in so many amounts
Want you to scream and I want you to bounce
Bounce like a check in a checking account
Bounce like a check in a checking account
They don't wanna see you win
Them haters rather see you fall
But see I'm getting money man
And now I got them rooting for the underdog
I'm getting money baby, the haters can't understand it
I hear a lot of compliments, most of them underhanded
I don't take it for granted because I came from the bottom
I'm just happy that my name is mentioned with all these options
But when you're thinking of options, I'm the best that you got
Mr. Talent over hype, Mr. Never the flop
If you need it, I got it, I'll be bringing it to ya
I got the whole Metro booming like that new Drake and Future
