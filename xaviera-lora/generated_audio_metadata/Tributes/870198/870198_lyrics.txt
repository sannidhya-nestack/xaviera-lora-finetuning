This time
Won't let it get
This time
You went too far
You crossed the line
Give it time
While I hear you
Beating my broken heart
Ooh
You went too far
You crossed the line
Give it time
While I eat up
A beat in my broken heart
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh)
(Oh)
