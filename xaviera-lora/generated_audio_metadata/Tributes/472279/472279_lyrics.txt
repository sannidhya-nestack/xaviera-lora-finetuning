The one I'm looking for is just like you
And like you they like the things I do
The one I'm looking for is just like you, oh oh
I hypnotize you with my voodoo
The one I'm looking for is just like you
And like you they like the things I do
The one I'm looking for is just like you oh oh
I hypnotize you with my voodoo
Waited all my life
Waiting all my life to learn your name
You move so right that I know
It's gotta be you
Just like you
Just like you
The one I'm looking for is just like you
And like you they like the things I do
The one I'm looking for is just like you, oh oh
I hypnotize you with my vote, oh oh
The one I'm looking for is just like you
And like you they like the things I do
The one I'm looking for is just like you, oh oh
I hypnotize you with my vote, oh oh
The one I'm looking for
Looks just like you (The one I'm looking for is just like you)
The one I'm looking for (The one I'm looking for is just like)
Looks just like you
