You call it attraction
I call it affection
You taking my rose
You taking my rose and turn it back
You call it elation
I call it frustration
Our best reaction
Your bad intention
I don't want it
I don't wanna do this now
If you wanna
If you wanna show me how
I don't wanna
I don't wanna do this now
You call it invention
I call it detention
You taking my rose
You taking my rose and turning it bad
You call it creation
It's an amputation
A separation
A manipulation
I don't want, I don't want, I don't want
I don't wanna do this now
If you wanna
If you wanna show me how
I don't wanna
I don't wanna do this now
You call it attraction
I call it affection
You're taking my rose
You're taking my rose and turning it
