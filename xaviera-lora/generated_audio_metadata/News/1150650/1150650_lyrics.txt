I just wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It makes me so sick to watch this world come undone
And all at the hand of one ruthless man
So many lives lost and for what?
This has gotta stop and it's gotta stop now
Let's fight for Ukraine and their pride somehow
This has gotta stop and it's gotta stop now
So many innocent lives and for what?
We're fighting for humanity
And bring this country back to peace
I don't wanna cry no more
Or hear people die no more
We're fighting for humanity
And bring this country back to peace
I don't wanna cry no more
Or hear people die no more
This has gotta stop
This has gotta stop
This has gotta stop
This has gotta stop
