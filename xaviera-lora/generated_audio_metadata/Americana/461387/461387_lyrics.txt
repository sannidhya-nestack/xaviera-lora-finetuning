Well, I am just a regular guy, but I'm as patriotic as I can be
I live in the home of the brave, and I live in the land of the free
Even in the darkest times when others might be afraid
I still stand up tall
My head held high
I'm American made
I'm a proud American
And I stand for what is right
Men like Thomas Jefferson
They stood and they made a fight
Even in the darkest times
When others might be afraid
I still stand up tall
Hold my head high
I'm American made, yeah
And even in the darkest times
When others might be afraid
We still stand tall, we hold our head high
we are American made
