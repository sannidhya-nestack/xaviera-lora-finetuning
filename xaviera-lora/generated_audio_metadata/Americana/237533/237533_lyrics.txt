USA, I fight for USA, I'm a freedom, yeah yeah
Hello dear, I miss you so
I wish I could see you smile
With strength from home, I'm not alone
We stand as one and pray
To keep our shores from hometown wars
We soldiers must obey
Stick to the plan
Protect our land
And defeat the enemy
USA
I pray for USA
And the freedom, yeah, yeah
USA, I fight for USA
And the freedom, yeah, yeah
Fathers die and mothers cry
A son who will never see
'Cause dad comes along
Grow up alone
The price of being free
USA, I'll fight for you
USA, and the freedom, yeah yeah
USA
I fight for U .S .A. and the freedom
U .S .A. I fight for U .S .A. and the freedom
Yeah, yeah
I pledge allegiance to my dream
The American Dream
USA
I fight for USA
And the freedom, yeah, yeah, USA
I fight for USA
And the freedom, USA
I fight for USA
I'm the freedom, yeah, yeah, I'm the freedom
