Look into the mirror
And tell me what you see
Is the man who stands before you
The one you wanna be?
Mmm, tell me what you see
Are you troubled by the past
Or things you did or didn't do
Gotta put the past behind
See what you can do
Oh, see what you can do
'Cause you can't cry forever
No you can't run and hide
Gotta put the past behind you
Dig down deep inside
Oh see what you can find
'Cause you can't cry forever
No, you can't run and hide
Gotta put the past behind you
Dig down deep inside
Oh, see what you can find
