We're marching together, arm in arm, hand in hand
We're marching for justice throughout this great land
We're marching for rights, equality guaranteed
For all races of people, all religions and creeds
We're marching peacefully, but we will not back down
We will not be trembled, hear our mighty sound
Ring the bell of freedom, sing a song of peace.
Join our brother /sisterhood, let injustice cease.
We're marching together
Arm in arm and in hand
We're marching for justice
Throughout this great land
Ring the bell of freedom
Sing our song of peace
Join our brother-sisterhood
Let injustice
