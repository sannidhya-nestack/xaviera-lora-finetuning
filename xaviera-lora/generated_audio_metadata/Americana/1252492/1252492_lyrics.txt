This sweet life has been good to me
I've seen so many things, some that shouldn't have been
I've heard the thunder, and felt the rain
And I have weathered the storm, but jobs are many and stayin'
Ah ah ah ah ah ah oh yeah, ah ah ah ah ah oh yeah, ah ah ah ah ah oh yeah, ah ah ah ah ah ah oh
I met a man, told me he danced with the devil
Right about, right about seven years old
He came right out of the floor at him
Danced naked round the floor with him
All this he told me was a story
He came to lose his soul
I-I-I-I-I-I-I over here
I-I-I-I-I-O over here
I -I -I -I -I -O over here
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Elle est si convaincée
Elle est si convaincée
Elle est si convaincée
Elle est si convaincée
This sweet life has been good to me
I've had some freedom and the will to be
So when this sweet life
It is taken from me
My baby I despair
My baby I'm prepared
Uh uh uh uh uh uh oh yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh oh yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh oh yeah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
It is sick on the set
It is sick on the set
It is sick on the set
It is sick on the set
