What do I know
Floating on the riverboat
I watch the towns pass as I move on
Electric eye into the future
In this I know the future seems to always come
It's a game we try so hard
If we change the past it might leave us alone
Floating on the river boats
A hundred years passed so slow
Move me to the west
Colorado passed it up for gold
And now I'm digging holes
Six feet under mining for my soul
It's a shame we try so hard
If you blame yourself you don't have far to go
A mirror to my soul
I pointed blame until I struck gold
I've lived a thousand years, have I no one?
Traveled every coast, looking for a ghost, found only one
Yes, you were in the pyramids, the riverbeds, the mountains I called home
I've lived a thousand years, you're all I know
