I've been giving all I can
I've been working 8 to 8
I'm tapping out it's time for someone else to tow this weight
I need time to refresh
I need time to relax
I'm breaking free don't look for me because I covered all my tracks
Gonna chill out with my favorite song
Take it easy all day long
Cruise on down the highway'til I'm gone
Leave my troubles in the trash
Take a breather, spend some cash
Leave all my cares behind me
Don't even try to find me
Can't you take a hint, leave me alone
Nothing looks much better than
A cold Corona and a mile of sand
et about my job because
I'm working on my tan
No bills to pay, no yard to mow
I'm doing what I please
Somebody call the doctor cause
I've got screw it disease
Gonna chill out with my favorite song
Take it easy all day long
Cruise on down the highway'til I'm gone
Leave my troubles in the trash
Take a breather, spend some cash
Leave all my cares behind me
Don't even try to find me
Can't you take a hint, leave me alone
Can't you take a hint, leave me alone?
