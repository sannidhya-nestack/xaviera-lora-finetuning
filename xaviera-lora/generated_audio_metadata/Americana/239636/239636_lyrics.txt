On shaky legs he did rise
The sunlight blinding to his eyes
The mare supports her foal and senses something special in his soul
To be a great one before the day he dies
He's just the keeper of the plains
Trying to find the spirited herd he once led
Remembering human battles that left the land red
Only removed by the summer's cool rains
He thinks he still leads his mains
But he's just a captive in his own chains
An American ghost galloping the plains
Just a ghost on these plains
Oh, he loved to run and play
Nothing but games till the end of the day
To be young and carefree in the plains
That was before he saw the human stains
First because of the steam driven trains
Then the guns the Indians would pay
And he's still the keeper of the great Midwest
Sees the emptiness where the buffalo did once roam
Where all creatures large and small called their home
Now only splattered with the human stains
He's just a lone mustang on these plains
Still looking for the next big test
An American ghost galloping the plains
Just a ghost of the plain
Now a stallion takes his place
In lead, protects his herd
Fulfills their every need
But he sees the bison fall
Of the white man's gun
Sees their bones bleach in the hot summer sun
And the humans keep doing their wicked deed
And he's the keeper of the great Midwest
Sees the emptiness where the buffalo did once roam
Where all creatures large and small call their home
Now only splattered with all the human stains
He's just a lone Mustang on these plains
Still looking for the next big test
An American ghost galloping the plains
Just a ghost of the plains
Oh, his anger rises and his blood boils
He sees the guns and his body coils
Galvest between the bison and the men
Takes the bullet where his friends have been
And he falls to the ground
And his heart tore
The stallion will lead no more
Oh, the stallion will lead no more
He's just the keeper of the plains
Trying to find the spirited herd he'd once led
Remembering human battles that left the land red
Only removed by the summer's cool rains
He thinks he still needs his manes
But he's just a captive in his own chains
An American ghost galloping the plains
Just a ghost on these plains
Now he's the keeper of the great Midwest
Sees the emptiness where buffalo did roam
Where all creatures large and small call their homes
Now only splattered with the human stains
He's just a lone Mustang on these plains
Still looking for the next big test
An American ghost galloping the plains
Just a ghost of the plains
