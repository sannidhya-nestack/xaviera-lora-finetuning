Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh huh huh huh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh huh huh huh
Down Mason Road by the bayou
Late to late afternoon just me and you
Wearing nothing but smiles in the waving grass
Kisses, kisses of sweet wine, looking at tan lines
And there was more than that
Summer days ended but the heat was on
Years of life ahead could do no wrong
Love was all we had to hold on to
Running, running on fields of dreams
And loving things I wanted you
By the bayou I gave my heart to you
By the bayou passion of youth
By the bayou all flowers grew
And I needed you
Promises are hard to keep
Two hands let go of me
Good vibes crazy ride into sunset
So, so long ago
But don't you know we never ever et
By the bayou I gave my heart to you
By the bayou passion of youth
By the bayou where flowers grew
And I needed you, I wanted you
Memories flow by underneath blue skies
They go on and on and on and on and on and on
By the bayou I gave my heart to you
By the bayou passion of youth
By the bayou where flowers grew
And I needed you, I wanted you
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down by the bayou
Hand in hand, taking chances in the afternoon
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down by the bayou
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
