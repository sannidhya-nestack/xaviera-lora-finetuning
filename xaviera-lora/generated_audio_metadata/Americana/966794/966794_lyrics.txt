I came over on a ship
Back in 1933
Just my mom, dad and me
First time I saw her torch I cried
I looked into those eyes
Knew I could fly
Now you don't talk like we do
But we're welcoming you
My father signed up for the Corps
And he went off to the war
To fight some more
One day some soldiers came to call
And they said he gave his all
And saved us all
Now you don't talk like we do
But we're thankful for you
So lay me down upon this land
Where bones turn into sand
Tell my children not to cry
For freedom I will die
In a place we all call home
A place we're near to roam
In a place of immigrants
We're all Americans
Look at the scars in her hand
Look at the soul of a man
Look at the scars in her hand
I watch my children play each day
In our garden where we pray
So far away
You'll never know the things you'll do
it's happening to you
What bombs can do
Now you don't pray like we do
Are we frightened of you?
So lay me down upon this land
Where bones turn into sand
Tell my children not to cry
For freedom I will die
In a place we all call home
In this place we're near to roam
In this place of immigrants
We're all
We're all American
We're all American
Look at the soul of a man
Look at the scars in her hand
Look at the soul of a man
Look at the scars in her hand
Jesus was hungry, he was poor
And his family they moved north
To find some more
Took his chances in this land
Built a home here with his hands
America
She don't look like we do
But you're American too
So lay me down upon this land
Where bones turn into sand
Tell my children not to cry
For freedom
In a place we all call home
In this place we're near to Rome
In this place of immigrants
We're all American
We're all American
Look at the spark in the haze, look at the deeds that they do, not at the deeds of the few
Look at the soul of the way, look at the spark in the haze, look at the deeds
Look at the deeds of a few, not at the deeds of a few (We are the fabricated)
Look at the soul of a man
Look at the scars in a hand
Look at the deeds that they do
Not at the deeds of a few
