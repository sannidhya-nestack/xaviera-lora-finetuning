All I could do was listen on a perfect August night
We walked the cliffs at Newport watching waves of the mountains high
She warned me not to listen and she made me feel her heart
Still a bleeding sorrow since her lover's ways had parted
While I listened to all her talking seemed like the evening sun stopped setting
Never letting on just how her love had caught me there
Why she cried how much she loved him and how he never understood
I couldn't interrupt her I just let her ramble on like she would
All at once it seems I felt her fading smile
Her timing hit me like a flash of fire
She knew she held me burning with desire
Was the last thing on her mind
When I saw her just today
I thought she'd stop on by
But there she goes just a step in
As I listen
To her silent goodbye
Her silent goodbye
Her silent goodbye
Yet another goodbye
