I set out to write you a song that would get you on your feet
That would introduce a rhythm and increase your heartbeat
I set out to write you a song that would carry you on home
That way I could have you when the carnival's long gone
I set out to write you a song whether it's short, whether it's long
That would make you turn your head and cry for me instead
I set out to write you a song
I wrote you a song, tell me where you're gone
I set out on the road where St. Christopher did find
My salvation of the five and I
He found it in a novel underneath the chauffeur glow
With dimming lights of wonder and the prophets whom to know
I set out to write you a song
I wrote you a song hope you won't be long
I'm no saint and I wear no promise ring
But one thing I can give you is a melody to sing
And if you want to meet me out along a winding coast
You best know it's your good fortune cause it's sure a pretty host
I set out to write you a song
I wrote you a song, hope it turns you on
Oh maybe I miss the train
Maybe you're out catching fame
Maybe it's all a bigger plan
To get me out of Texas
Cause the west has left me breathless
I set out to write you a song as the floods carry on
And I'll say a little prayer for the sweet hereafter
I'll leave you with a chapter, a map and a wrapper
As I drove away I heard the crows stirring up the pasture
I set out to write you a song
I wrote you a song
Yeah, I set out to write you a song
I'm good enough as gone
