When you gonna get it through your heart, babe, I love you
When you gonna get it through your heart, I care
When you gonna get it through your heart, you were meant for me
When you get it through, babe, I'll be there
I understand why you're so careful just now
Coming off a failed love affair
But I'm a risk worth taking
Give me half a chance
I'll help you put away your fears
When you gonna get it through your heart, babe, I love you
When you gonna get it through your heart, I care
When you gonna get it through your heart, you were meant for me
When you get it through, babe, I'll be there
Girl I know it's hard to learn to trust someone new
It's easier to give up on romance
But if you find it in your heart to trust in me
Babe I'll teach your heart to dance
Step on out now
When you gonna get it through your heart
Babe I love you
When you gonna get it through your heart
I care
When you gonna get it through your heart
You were meant for me
When you get it through babe I'll be there
Don't play it safe with love, babe, that's a losing game
You've gotta lay your heart out on the line
Girl, it was a lucky break when he broke your heart
I'm gonna make you glad you're mine
When you gonna get it through your heart, babe, I love you
When you gonna get it through your heart, I care
When you gonna get it through your heart, you were meant for me
When you get it through, babe, I'll be there
When you get it through, babe, I'll be there
