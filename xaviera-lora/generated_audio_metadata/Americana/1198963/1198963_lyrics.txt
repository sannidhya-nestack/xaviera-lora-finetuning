Dear heart, I know I've hurt you some
Dear heart, it's you that I'm running from
There's been so many, it's hard to count
I know you need me to slow down
Because I wanna break my heart
There's so much pain I can't avoid
Always wallow in my hurt
Please help me come back to earth
Dear heart, it's hard to leave some
Dear heart, some I just can't et
Sometimes I wake up at night (sometimes I wake up)
Sweating when you need me (I think about the ones)
Who love me
Because I don't wanna break
My heart
I know my heart is taking some knocks
I'm just trying to take a rest
Please help me understand (Please help me understand)
Please help me understand (Please help me understand)
The way my body aches
They're hard
Some I just can't et
Dear heart, some that I have regretted
Sometimes I wake up at night (Sometimes I wake up)
Longing to be there (I'm thinking about the ones)
Who love me (Because I'm awake)
My heart
Don't wanna break, wanna break, wanna break my heart
Ooh, don't wanna break, wanna break, wanna break my heart
