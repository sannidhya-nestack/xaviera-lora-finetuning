Mom and dad met on a blind date
She a half hour early, he was late
Shared a coke and held hands in the show
If they kissed goodnight, the moon would know
One date lead to two, two lead to three
Wedding ring and then a family
Every meal we bow our heads in prayer
When fate comes into play we have no say
Call it the domino effect
One step leads right to the next
Two hearts connect and start a chain event
Call it the domino effect
Call it the domino effect
Sunday spent a picnic by the lake
Driving home we'd stop for chocolate shakes
Lady Luck sure brought me a good wife
Then my daughter brought me a new life
Call it the domino effect
One step leads right to the next
Two hearts connect and start a chain event
Call it the domino effect
Call it the domino effect
The first time my daughter smiled up at me
She knocked down my last domino
Call it the domino effect
One step leads right to the next
Two hearts connect and start a chain event
Call it the domino effect
Call it the domino effect
