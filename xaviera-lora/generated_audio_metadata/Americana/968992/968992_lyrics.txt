It took the bravest many nights and many days
Even then they lost good men along the way
Oh, hallowed ground, hallowed ground
Where the old bones lay
And day by day more settlers did arrive
They built a home for their children and their wives on
Hallowed ground, hallowed ground
Where the old bones lay
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Down where the old bones lay
They might for silver and they might for gold
They stumbled on that burial site of old on
Hallowed ground, hallowed ground
Where the old bones lay
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
That's where the old balls are laid, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
That's where the old balls are laid, yeah
That one day a man would pay for greed and lust
A great fire rage, then their world was turned to dust on
Hallowed ground, hallowed ground
Where the old bones lay, mm-mm-mm
Where the old bones lay
Mm mm mm mm
That's where the old bones lay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Where the old bones lay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
That's where the old bones
Where the old bones
That's where the old bones lay
