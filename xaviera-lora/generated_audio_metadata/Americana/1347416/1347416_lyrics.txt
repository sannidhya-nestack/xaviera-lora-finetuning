Morning train has come and gone, looks like she wasn't on
Her face still glowing red with scorn, you don't need to ask about it
Questions ask, come never answered around this time of year
Gotta look round behind her head to see whose neck is there
Some afternoons get cold as snow with frost to set them off
Walking barefoot down the glacier's path is twice as tough
Darkness comes so early now the seasons start parading
Winter sun so weak and clouded over every day
Things got turned around
She'll cherish another town
Find herself a hideaway before they both go down
Her ghost still hears his cry though her body's above the ground
A place to go when things get turned around
First he was her candy man, she was his sugar cane
Ends up running so far and fast away from her old name
Every time he hears it tears him up like ripping rice
Every mirror shows your face a looking sad and sad
He rambled all around his world to see what he could see
Now he's got all he can do to find a place to sleep
He'd wish she never meant the hurtful, hardened things she said
Some days he just pretends to dream still sleeping in her bed
If only her intention spoke it up just a little louder
If her old ears had heard it better up in her ivory tower
He takes that train and gets his due
He's leaving her the station
Waiting for the shoe to drop
Ain't all that fascinating
He'll twist and slant whatever it is that suits his foolish pride
She'll be over yonder waiting for his next abiding
I don't know nothing much except things got turned around
Seems to go back and forth and things get turned around
