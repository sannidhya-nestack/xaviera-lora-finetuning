Sitting watching ships sail, wishing I was on one
Sailing to some far and distant shore
God it would be so nice just to feel the good earth
Underneath my feet once more
Waiting for the night to fall
Seems like this day will never end
Waiting for the night to fall
Darkness show my what a lonely friend
Butterflies and birds fly
Rusty cans just float by
Oh what's it like to be free, yeah
Home is where you make it
But I just can't take it
Prison walls have seen the last of me
Waiting for the night to fall
Seems like this day will never end
Waiting for the night to fall
Darkness shows I want an old friend
Well, I've been here so long, don't remember how long
But I know today will be my last
Come this time tomorrow, I'll be sailing freely
Over mighty waters of my past
Waiting for the night to fall
Seems like this day will never end
Waiting for the night to fall
Darkly show my one and only friend
(Waiting for the night to come)
I gotta make it one more day, yeah
(Waiting for the night to come)
Oh, I'm dying, dying to be free, yeah
(Waiting for the)
Come on, the sun gonna shine on me, baby, yeah
I feel free, free at last, oh, I'm free now
