What am I gonna do when the twilight comes and the whooper wheel calls your name?
What am I gonna do when I close my eyes and you're standing here again?
How can I just say a prayer
And trust the empty sky to care for you
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna say
When a long lost friend asks me how you've been
What am I gonna hear
When the heart this night sends a ghost on the winter wind
How can I just say goodbye and go on without you
What am I gonna do
Whose laughing eyes will shine for me
Whose warm voice will meld me
Whose touch will make me tremble in the night
And how can there be another love
When I will still be dreaming of
The one that I can never have again
How can I just say a prayer and trust the empty sky to care for you?
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do when the twilight comes and the whipperwheel calls your name?
