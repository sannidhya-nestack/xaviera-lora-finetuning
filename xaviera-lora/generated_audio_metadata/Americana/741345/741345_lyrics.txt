Hotter than a pistol, hotter than a blazing fire
Those petal lips melt in a wild desire
You don't have to ask me what am I gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
You're hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than a pistol, hotter than a blazing fire
Rose-petalled lips melting a wild desire
You don't have to ask me what am I gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
You're hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Oh what the heck
You've got legs right up to your neck
Like a goddess of love
You know exactly what I'm thinking of
You don't have to ask me what am I gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
You're hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than a pistol, hotter than a blazing fire
Rose petal lips melt in a wild desire
You don't have to ask me what am I gonna do
I'm gonna make love to you
You're hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than hot, hotter than hot
You're hotter than hot, hotter than hot
Hotter than hot
And I love everything you got
