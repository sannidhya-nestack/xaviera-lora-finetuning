You carried and delivered life stories in a song
From a scream to a whisper
Your feelings were so strong
Simstone brought us shivers
You hoped to change what was wrong
Seeking perfect balance
More than an old town legend
Lifelong best friend, snow or rain
Served your country for a second
Came home to silent pain
Sold your stories too tragic for some to tell
On their way back from hell
Seeking perfect balance
Trees fall for timber
Old people lose their glimmer
Social commentary was a tasty snack
Satire with our TV dinners
A side of humor with a six pack
Attracted all the saints and sinners
Your words were melancholy
The truth can be that way
Melted like Salvador Dali
Persistence of memory
Your light through your song
Will always stay
To remind us not to sway
Seeking perfect balance
Seeking perfect balance
A man of many talents
Perfect balance, Amen
