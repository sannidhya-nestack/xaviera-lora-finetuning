If I have to talk to you, I'll never win
It's only by my gaping mouth I get all the mess I'm in
It seems that talk is all that it ever is
Why is love and language all the time?
Ain't it just true feeling that
You find out all you got to find
If there were no talk I wouldn't mind
You know I loved you well and well I might sometime
I wish you well in all you do
And hope you find real love sometime
We seem to love more better all the time
Used to let me hide behind
The words that came before goodbye
Oh yeah
Guess I'll never know just how to play
How to play them games that don't change more than they give can play
They take your days and years and act like nothing to matter anyway
They used to make me feel that love was something you could really feel
I never heard a single word you say
If I have to talk to you, I'd never win
you're twice as smart as me and your heart ain't in it
But guess I'll talk to you and lose again
