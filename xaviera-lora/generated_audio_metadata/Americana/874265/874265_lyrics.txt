Helicopter, rollercoaster, taxi cab, limousine
Pickup truck or spaceship, could you find me some more gasoline?
I know I'm still searching through the years
And oh, I'm still searching for my tears
Always running, both feet on the ground
Now nobody's gonna weigh me down
'Cause I'm flying on paper airplane
To Jupiter or Mercury
No parachute could save me now
I'm where I wanna be
I'm an aviator singing my song
I'm an aviator I got my sunglasses on
Aviator I've been silent through the years in the atmosphere
I've been in the atmosphere for all these years
New York you look a lot like Mexico
All the pretty faces that nobody really knows
Isn't it all just make up?
It's makeup and make believe
And oh, I'm still searching through the years
And oh, I'm still searching for my tears
And all the faces, they're so pretty
And the camouflage is melting away
It's so beautiful, I think it's gonna rain
I'm flying on a paper airplane
To Jupiter or Mercury
No parachute can save me now
I'm where I wanna be
I'm an aviator singing my song
I'm an aviator I got my sunglasses on
Aviator I've been silent through the years in the atmosphere
I've been in the atmosphere for all these years
Sunglasses on, sunglasses on, sunglasses on for all these years
Sunglasses on, sunglasses on, sunglasses on in the atmosphere
Sunglasses on, sunglasses on, sunglasses on
To hide these tears
To hide these tears
To hide these tears
