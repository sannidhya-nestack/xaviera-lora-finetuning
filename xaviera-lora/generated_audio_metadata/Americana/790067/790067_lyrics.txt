Hamlet reads the Bible at a booth by the door
Where some prophet of the obvious is passed out on the floor
While Genghis Khan warns Shakespeare, "The fish here makes you ill"
Mercy isn't on the menu at the windmill bar and grill
Joan of Arc tells Einstein we're all saints in the womb
While Judas keeps complaining there's no soap in the bathroom
And Jesus can't get a table he leans on a windowsill
And tries converting the bouncer at the windmill bar and grill
Happy hour finds Elvis decked out in a roadkill fur
While Marie Antoinette keeps asking what's for dessert
The waitress says German chocolate cake
As in walks Jack and Jill
Seems no one's getting carted at the windmill bar and grill
Marilyn asked Dimaggio for a no-fall divorce
Sinatra's supposed to sing tonight
But I hear he's kinda hoarse
The house band is the Beatles
But Bach is on the bill
And Nero plays the fiddle
At the windmill bar and grill
Joan of Arc asks Edison, "Hey Tom, you got a light?"
While Mohammed and Socrates try to pick a fight
With anyone who thinks they can make time stand still
Hope is just another entree at the windmill bar and grill
Couples try to hook up as it gets near closing time
Joan of Arc flirts with Nero by the no smoking sign
While Delilah twirls Samson's hair she swear she's on the pill
Oh but Samson's having second thoughts at the windmill bar and grill
Cleopatra and Elvis drink tequila and lime
And the Rockefeller's table only tips a dime
The owners want to torch the joint, let insurance foot the bill
They're tired of all the egos at the windmill, bar and grill
At the windmill
I'm green
