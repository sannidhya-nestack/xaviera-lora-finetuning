I don't wanna go home
I don't wanna go home
I don't want this night to end
I wanna do it all again
Well it's been so wonderful
Oh so wonderful
I can't believe that it's the end
I want to do it all again
Yeah, and I want to thank you
I want to thank you
For the good times we had
And if I, I could stay longer
I wouldn't feel so bad, I don't wanna go on
Please don't send me home
I don't want it all to end
I wanna do it all again
And I wanna thank you, I wanna thank you
For the good times we had
And if I, I could stay longer
I wouldn't feel so bad
I don't wanna go home
Please don't send me home
I don't want this night to end
I want to do it all again
I can't believe it's the end
I want to do it all again
