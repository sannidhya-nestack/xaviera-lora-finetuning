You dyed your hair blonde
And tried to soften the bum
In a deliberate mood
The men across your path
Aren't prepared for the bath
And you can baptize
You did whatever you want
A ghost in search of a haunt
And then you leave with chill
You're searching for the wrong guys
A ship in search of a rock
That's gonna capsize
You're a shell lost in the waves
Someone threw your pearl away
You're a shell tossed in the waves
Someone threw your pearl away
When you're ready to do
Whatever you gotta do
Then I'll be there
But if you're gonna complain
I'm marinating your pain
Well I'm hanging up the phone
You're acting like it's too late
Like nothing else can be done
And so you run and run and run
When all you had to do
Stop and say I need you
You're a shell lost in the waves
Someone threw your pearl away
You're a shell lost in the waves
Someone threw your pearls away
You're a shell tossed in the waves
Someone threw your pearls away
You're a shell tossed in the waves
As someone threw a whipper away
