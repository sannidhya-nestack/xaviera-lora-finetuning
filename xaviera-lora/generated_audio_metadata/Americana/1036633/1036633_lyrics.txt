Bobby hits a home run, wins the game for his team
John gets a trophy at his first spelling bee
Jenny finally passes her driver's license test
Abby's apple pie receives a ribbon as the best
They may not have fifteen minutes of fame
No history book will record their names
But each of them can tell a lifetime story
When they celebrate their moment of glory
Every single person is a star in the night
The spirit of their heart is what makes them bright
Anyone can shine like a light in the dark
When the time is right they will make their mark
No one needs fifteen minutes of pain
Or a history book to record their name
Everyone can tell a lifetime story
When they celebrate their moment of glory
Some people like climbing mountains
But the view is just as good from a hill
It's really not important how high a person climbs
As long as it gives them a thrill
No one needs fifteen minutes of fame
Or history book to record their name
Everyone can tell a lifetime story
When they celebrate their moment of glory
Everyone can tell a lifetime story
When they celebrate their moment of glory
