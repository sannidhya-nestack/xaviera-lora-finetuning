She is the only one that I wanna know
She is the only one that I wanna believe in
And you can't slow down the pace cause when you know you know
And she is the only one that I wanna believe in
Look me in the face hey miss Winona
Didn't you and me have a place way back there in Arizona
Look me in the face, say Miss Winona
Tell me that you wanna fall for a man like me and that's all that you need
She is the only one that I wanna take
She is the only one that I want to make mine one day
And when you got something real there's no way to fake
But sometimes the words are spoken and there's nothing left to say
Look me in the face hey miss Winona
Didn't you and me have a place way back there in Arizona
Look me in the face, hey miss Winona
Tell me that you wanna fall for a man like me and that's all that you need
Tell me that you wanna fall for a man like and that's all that you need
Look me in the face, hey miss Winona
Didn't you and me have a place way back there in Arizona
Look me in the face, hey miss Winona
Tell me that you wanna fall
For a man like me and that's all that you need
Tell me that you wanna fall
For a man like me and that's all that you need
Tell me that you wanna fall for a man like me and that's all that you need
