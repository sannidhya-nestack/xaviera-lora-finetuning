Some of us are born to plow the earth
Get down on our knees and dig the dirt
Some of us are born to silence
Some are born to sing
I know I was born to do one thing
Inherit the wind
And everything that stands in its way
Inherit the wind
No matter what course it may take
Some of us are born to gamble, lose, draw or win
I was born to inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
So when the gypsy wind comes down the plain
And the storm clouds hide the moon away
Then you'll hear me like a distant train
Tapping softly at your window pane
You wonder should you stay or should you go
But till you surrender you won't know
Feeling stronger than a hurricane
And still as tender as the rain
Inherit the wind
And everything that stands in its way
Inherit the wind
No matter what course it may take
Some of us are born to gamble, lose, draw or win
I was born to inherit the wind
And everything that stands in its way
Inherit the wind
No matter what course it may take
Some of us are born to gamble, lose, draw, or win
I was born to inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
