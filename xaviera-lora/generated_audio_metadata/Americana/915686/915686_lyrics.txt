Too far down and it's all uphill
Ghosts sitting on my windowsill
Drapes drawn but my body needs food
Guess it gives me a reason to move
Parched land with no hope of rain
Dry sand all the colors drain
Somebody else has moved into my skin
All I've done don't amount to nothing
Nothing I've done
Snake mind and it's speaking in tongues
Dreaming scared but my feet won't run
In my head dark clouds of sparrows
Pulse rates getting closer to zero
Look around but there's nothing I see
In the mirror I don't look like me
If there's a tether then I lost it somewhere
Throw a rope if there's anyone there
Throw a rope
Anyone
My heart is pumping over cane
And every day is just the same
Got no voice to shout
Can't climb my way out
I've fallen too far down
Too far down and it's all uphill
Ghosts sitting on my windowsill
Yellow jackets I'm gonna get stung
Hornets nest they're swarming the sun
Black crows call picking at bones
Broken line on the telephone
Just don't know who's living in my skin
All I've done don't amount to nothing
Nothing I've done
Desolation leaves a stain
And every day is just the same
I got no voice to shout
Can't climb my way out
I've fallen too far down
Fallen too far
And down
