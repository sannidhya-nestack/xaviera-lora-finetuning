There's a place that I know
That I'll always call home
And my brothers and sisters still live there
Though I must go away
You know I wish I could stay
So I'll play you the same Louis Waltz
I can almost hear the symphony play
Starry nights at Sheldon Hall
And wherever I roam
You know I'm never at home
Till I hear the St. Louis Waltz
Someday I'll return for a little while
Someday I'll return to stay
And then I'll hold you in my arms
And we'll dance under the arch
To the lovely St. Louis Waltz
Someday I'll return for a little while
Someday I'll return to stay
And then I'll hold you in my arms
And we'll dance under the arch
To the lovely St. Louis Waltz
