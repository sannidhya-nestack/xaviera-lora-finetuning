I've been racing round all morning
Going nowhere fast
Trying to fix what's broken
Seems nothing ever lasts
But you know I can't fix crazy
So I'm going out tonight
I was crying in my coffee
Spending my last dime
Trying like the devil
To make up for lost time
But you know I can't go backwards
So I'm going out tonight
I spent half a lifetime
Throwing you a lifeline, baby
It was a losing fight, night after lonely night
Now maybe there's still time for me
Now I'm fixing my own dinner and fixing my hair
I don't know where I'm going but I'm fixing to get there
you know I can't fix crazy
Yeah I finally saw the light
You can fix an old flat tire
You can fix a worn out shoe
You can even fix a ticket
If you know who knows who
But you know you can't fix crazy
So I'm going out tonight
I know I can't fix crazy
No matter how I try
I know I can't fix crazy
I just gotta say goodbye
It's crazy to keep crying
Yeah, I finally saw the light
I know I can't fix crazy
And I'm gonna be alright, alright
