I can well remember your love was grace my life
Love never seemed so curious and fleeting
When you were spillin' love you'd never given me up
And now you turn your thoughts and eyes to leavin'
I can well remember when your love would lift me up
When I'm spinnin' slightly off my perfect game
Still thinking as I do that life is all sewn up
It includes the one who's sewn it quite the same
But the seasons start their parading
And the air starts blowing colder
When the stars start swinging lower
The coldest nights I spend alone
That's the time I get to thinking I remember what you said
In this last year the time for love has flown by
It's the timing of the season when your loving hand is dealt
Now I'm stranded on the side and I don't know why
The wheel of loving's fortune has spun around too fast
For an old and lonely fool like me
Still trying out a habit, but the habit's all of late
Still hearing older voices talk to me
But the seasons still are parading
The air's still blowing colder
The stars still swinging lower
There's empty rooms I ain't alone
In a house not alone just me
Still hearing older voices talk to me
In a house not alone just me
I need a truer voice to comfort me
In a house not alone just me
I still hear an older voice talk to me
In a house not alone just me
Need a true red voice to comfort me
Well I don't know why I had my doubts
I'm living in an empty house
In a house not alone, just me
I need a truer voice to comfort me
Well, I don't know, I had my doubts
