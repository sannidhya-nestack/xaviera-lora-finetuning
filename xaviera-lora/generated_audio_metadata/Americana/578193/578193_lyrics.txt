I don't care what they all say
I'm gonna love you anyway, uh-huh
I don't care what they all say
I wanna stay with you and play, uh-huh
They're just messing with our minds
They're just wasting our sweet time
I don't care what they may do
I just wanna make love to you, uh-huh
I don't care what they may do
We'll be two baby me and you uh huh
Yeah they're just fussin' tellin' lies
I can read it in their eyes
Yeah one love
So strong, two hearts will live on forever
I don't care what's wrong or right
Black or white, baby, day or night
All I know is, baby, I love you
And forever I'll be true
Yeah, they're just messing with our minds
They're just wasting our sweet time
I don't care what they all say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
