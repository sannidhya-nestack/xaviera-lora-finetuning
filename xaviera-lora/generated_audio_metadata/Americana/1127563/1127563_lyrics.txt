My country'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring
My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rails
Thy woods and temple hills
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let wrongs their silence break
The sound roll on
Our Father's God to Thee
Author of liberty
To Thee we sing
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light
Protect us by thy might
Great God our King
