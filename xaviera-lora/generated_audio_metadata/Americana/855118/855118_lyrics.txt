I am every father's son
The barefoot boy next door
The apple of old mother freedom's eye
Born all across this land
I was raised to give a damn
I came from hometowns everywhere
When I heard that battle cry
Some have called me minute man
Johnny Rep or G .I. Joe
In every war I've had a different name
And I made a sacrifice
Yes, I gladly gave my life
The spirit rise, the breeze that makes old glory wave
Don't you know me, I'm the unknown soldier
I proudly serve you to keep our country strong
I'm the countless who have died to keep liberty alive
If you remember me then I'm not really gone
And the unknown soldier marches on
In the fields of Vietnam
On the seas of desert sand
I'm the sentry and I stand my watch alone
My soul will rest in peace as long as America stays free
I'm the heart of every boy who's never coming home
And don't you know me, I'm the unknown soldier
I proudly serve you to keep our country strong
I'm the countless who have died
To keep liberty alive
If you remember me, then I'm not really gone
And the unknown soldier marches on
And don't you know me, I'm the unknown soldier
I'd probably serve you
To keep our country strong
I'm the countless who have died
To keep our liberty alive
If you remember me
Then am I really gone?
And the unknown soldier marches on
And marches on
Oh, marches on
Oh
