It'll all come back around to you baby, it'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby, it'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
And I'm riding straight into the sun
Heading out to nowhere and I'll get there when I'm done
I'm leaving, gonna get out of this place
Hope you took a picture if you wanna see my face
If you don't like my point of view
This metal thing is just for you
It'll all come back around to you baby
It'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you
It'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby
It'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you
It'll all come back around
I'm loaded
Gonna drink you off my mind
The only things I have back home is the mess you left behind
Come get it
You're gonna get what you deserve
Come sit down at the table cause revenge is being served
If you don't like my point of view
This middle finger's just for you
It'll all come back around to you baby
It'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you
It'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby
It'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you
It'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby, it'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby, it'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby, It'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby, it'll all come back around
The things that you do, reflection of you, it'll all come back around
It'll all come back around to you baby
