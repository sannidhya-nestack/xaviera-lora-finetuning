I woke up from the time of my life
Wondering where I've been
Six months since I've seen the sun
I think I need some rest
I heard they're hiring at the five and dime
She says I need a job
Got a song running through my head
I need to lay it down
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
My baby hit the road one day
I told her she'd bet back
Wouldn't you know I was right this time
I helped her unpack
I may not have a lot
I'm just a simple man
If I had to do it over again
I'd keep the same old plan
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now, hmm, hmm, hmm
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it now
We're gonna make it, yes, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it now
