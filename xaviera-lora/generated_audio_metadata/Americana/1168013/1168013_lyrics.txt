If I have to be alone
Somehow I just know
I can't be treated this way
I've been up all night just crying
One of us is lying
I know there ain't nothing more to say
If I could make you see how you've been to me
It would change things from night to day
How many nights I tried
How many nights I cried
Now I'm leaving on the morning train
Leaving on the morning train, yeah
You know I can't explain it
I don't understand it
You know I ain't lying
I just hear that whistle blow
Somehow I just know
I can't be treated this way
On the morning train
If I could make you see how you've been to me
I would change things from night to day
How many nights I tried, how many nights I cried
Now I'm leaving on the morning train
Leaving on the morning train, yeah
You know I can't explain it
I don't understand it
You know I ain't lying
I just hear that whistle blow
Somehow I just know
I can't be treated this way
On the morning train (on the morning train)
On the morning train (on the morning train)
The morning train (on the morning train)
Leaving on the morning train (on the morning train)
On the morning train
On the morning train
Leaving on the morning train
On the morning train
On the morning train
On the morning train
Leaving on the morning train
On the morning train
On the morning train
On the morning train
Leaving on the morning train
On the morning train
The morning train
The morning train
Leaving on the morning train
The morning train
The morning train
Leaving on the morning train
