I feel a little overcome
Now that the mad work week's done
Been too long since we had fun
Down on Bourbon
So grab your stomping boots
I'll wear my dancing shoes
Let's go thrash out our blues
Down on Bourbon Street
I need to go mortier-fort
Before we pay dodo
Cher baby come let's go
Down on Bourbon
So grab your stopping boots
I'll wear my dancing shoes
Let's go thrash out our blues
Down on Bourbon street
And I miss that sparkle in your eye
And you, I think you miss it too
I feel a little overcome
Now that the med work week's done
Been too long since we had fun
Down on Bourbon
So grab your stomping boots
I'll wear my dancing shoes
Let's go thrash out our blues
Down on Bourbon Street
And I miss that sparkle in your eye
And you, I think you miss it too
This Ford's no limousine
It's a fine ride for a Cajun queen
Top down and shiny clean
Down on Bourbon
So grab your stoppin' boots
I'll wear my dancin' shoes
Let's go thrash out our blues
Down on Bourbon Street
Down on Bourbon Street
Dress me up and turn me loose
Come on darling, voulez-vous
Down on Bourbon Street
