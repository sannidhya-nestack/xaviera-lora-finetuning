I don't mind if you waste my time
I'm not going anywhere
I don't mind, I'll be fine
'Cause I'm not going anywhere
They say the lights always burn bright out on Broadway
They say there's always some time to change
I don't mind if you waste my time
I'm not going anywhere
They say the lights are always burning bright on Broadway
They're out there turnin' night into day and day into night
Well I'll tell ya, you can have it all in broadway
Cause I'm not going
And I don't mind if you waste my time
But I'm not going anywhere
