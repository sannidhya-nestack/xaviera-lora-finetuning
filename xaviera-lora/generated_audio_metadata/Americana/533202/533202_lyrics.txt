Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watchin' for silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shone a holy light
The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
When I was a seeker, I sought both night and day
I asked the Lord to help me, and He showed me the way
He made me a watchman upon the city wall
And if I am a Christian, I am the least of all
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Down in a lonely manger the humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation that blessed Christmas morn
The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angels' chorus that hailed our Saviour's birth
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
