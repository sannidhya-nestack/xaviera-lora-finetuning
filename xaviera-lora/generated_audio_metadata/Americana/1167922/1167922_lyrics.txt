Sailing away on a ship with no anchor
On a course without compass
Only stars drifting by day
In a sea of mixed meaning
Such a small lonely vessel
Like a ship in a jar
Tossed around, lost and found
Still I'm so far from shore
But at least I'm the captain
I'm not first mate anymore
Sailing away
Though the sky looks uncertain
The horizon a curtain, come what may
Leaving behind that old cargo of sorrow
There's just now and tomorrow
Where I'm found, I can't say
But if we pass in the night
Shine your light, shine it bright
For we're so far
From shore
But at least we're the captains
We're not first mates anymore
At last we're the captains
We've got oceans
To explore
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Brave soul, sail away
