We live in Portsmouth town
Leaving little behind us
We leave port soul and sound
Only the sun set before us
I am not a conqueror
I am no conquistador
I am not a follower
I am just a mixer, a mixer, a mixer, I
We're leaving Portsmouth town
Like so many before us
Never to return
They gave their lives just to save us
I am not a conqueror
I am no conquistador
I am not a follower
I am just a mixara, mixara, mixara, I, I
The end does not justify the means
No, not in my name
The end does not justify the means
No, not in my name
I am not a conqueror
I'm not a conquistador
I'm not a follower
I'm just a mixara, mixara, mixara, ay, ay
They march in Roman time
These invaders before us
They run our modern crime
They use our own words to fool us
I am not a conqueror
I am not conquistador
I am not a follower
I am just a mixara, mixara, mixara, ay, ay
We aim does not justify the means
No, not in my name
The end does not justify the means
No, not in my name'cause I am not a conqueror
I am not conquistador
I am not a follower
I am just a mixara, mixara, mixara, ay, ay
