Was with a fella not long ago
Whose shadow eclipse is in her glow
Yet you're unique, you're clear and calm
An open heart, strange new aplomb
Don't quite know yet where this will lead
But I'll tell you something between you and me
You hang the moon for me
You hang the moon for me
Paint the stars, set the sunrise
Fill my world up with pretty skies
You hang the moon on me
With you it seems your luster's bright
You shine so clear in day or night
Love learning'bout your life and work
Love finding out your kinks and quirks
Remind me of a Cheyenne tale
Beautiful soul just like my hair
Don't quite know yet where this will lead
But I'll tell you something between you and me
You ain't the mood for me
You ain't the mood
For me, you paint the stars, set the sun to rise
Fill my world up with pretty skies
You hang the moon for me
You hang the moon for me
You hang the moon for me
You paint the stars, set the sunrise
Fill my world up with pretty skies
You hang the moon for me
You hang the moon
For me, you hang the moon for me
For me
For me
For me
For me
For me
