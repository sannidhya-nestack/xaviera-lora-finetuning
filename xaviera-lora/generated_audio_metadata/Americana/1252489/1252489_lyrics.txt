I don't need nobody's help and I don't need nobody else and I don't need nobody I can roll my own
It's that you've been gone, I see no loving, I see no sense, I feel it coming
I don't need nobody, I can roll my own
I can roll my own
I can roll my own
I don't need no help with thinking and I don't need no help with drinking
I don't need nobody I can roll with my own
And since you've been gone I see no loving I feel no sense I see it coming
I don't need nobody I can roll with my own
Cause I can roll with my own
Cause I can roll with my own
I don't need nobody's help and I don't need nobody else and I don't need nobody I can roll my own
And I don't need no help with thinking
And I don't need no help with drinking
I don't need nobody, I can roll my own
I can roll my own
I can roll my own, hey
Should you ever feel the need to help a man get off his knees
Then there's no need, I need no help at all
Should you ever feel a grieving
There's one thing that you will need
The knowledge there ain't no love lost at all
I can roll my own
I can roll my own
I can roll my own
