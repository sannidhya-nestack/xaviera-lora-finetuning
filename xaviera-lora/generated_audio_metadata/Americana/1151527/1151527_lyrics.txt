Some people got the power to kill you forever
Like a city of sin, you never come out quite like you come in
Some girls got a glance, a friar eye forever
Like lightning a striking on a clear blue sky you never know what hits ya
False love I can't tell ya, just what you need to hear
Don't matter which word is true when it's whispered soft in your ear
The right one can drop you right here to the present
Make time stand on its side whenever that girl arrives
But since she's gone I realize
I worship the ground under her thighs
Not that it does me any good
She's solid gone for good
She's solid gone
If I had three wishes
I'd make'em all happen
Wish one, two, three'd be
To bribe the Lord to send you back to me
But you know for such a sinner I can't help but to listen
To them words that come a-flowing down inside that lightning sound
Give it to me one more time for good, a good mention
With a solid love so solid gone I can't help but miss
If it weren't for the chillin' I'd stay in bliss
With a solid love I can't help but miss
Some people got the power to change it forever
Like a city of sin, you never come out like you come in
The false lover can't tell you what you need to hear
But false love's got the power
It's a cool song, man. It's a really cool song.
