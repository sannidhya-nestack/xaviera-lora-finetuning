It was four in the morning, the game was Texas Hold'Em
I had the short stack, and Abraham had the chips
Sweet Pete and the good doctor were somewhere in between
Two cocks facedown were dealt to me
And everybody was all in
Here comes the flop
Take your turn on the turn my friend
Well I'll take my chances on the river
I'll take my chances on the river
Two cowboys staring at me
Sweet Pete's got the jacks
The good doctor's got an A7 flush
And Abraham plays the bluff
Abraham plays the bluff
I was behind the blind
The action was on me
Had to pay the five large to see the community
Sweet Pete and the good doctor were happy to check
Abraham pushed another three grand to raise the bets
But everybody was all in, here comes the flop
And take your turn on the turn my friend
Well I'll take my chances on the river
I'll take my chances on the river
And two cowboys staring at me
Sweet Pete's got the jacks
But a good doctor's got an A7 flush
And Abraham plays the bluff
Abraham plays the bluff
The flop came in no help, no help for me
The ace on the turn was the last thing that I wanted to see
Sweet Pete and the good Dr. B began to grin
The king on the river fed streets, I pushed all in
And everybody was all in
And here comes the flop
Take your turn on the turn my friend while I
Take my chances on the river
I'll take my chances on the river
Two cowboys staring at me
Sweet Pete's got the jacks
A good doctor's got an A7 flush
And Abraham plays the bluff
Abraham plays the bluff
