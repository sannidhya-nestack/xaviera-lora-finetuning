If I could love like my dog
I'd see everyone the same
I'd live only here and now
I would be happy everyday
No cares about the future
I'll ties back to the past if I could love like my dog
If I could love like my dog
I'd ive and et
I'd overlook all the flaws
With unconditional love
No cares about the future
Or baggage from the past
If I could love like my dog
Love and living only for now
Happy with the world as it is
With kindness I overflow
My heart is pure goodness
If I could love like my dog
I would never second guess
I wouldn't need much at all
I could be satisfied with less
No cares about the future
Or ties back to the past
If I could love like my dog
