One morning in November
As I am walking out the door
As I make my way down city streets
Like so many times before
I will silently remember
Everyone who gave their life
So that I may have the freedom
To perform this sacred right
And I'll sign my name by the number
Take a pencil and a form
And I'll make a mark beside the names of the ones who lead us home
Who will lead us
We the people
For each revolutionary who fell beneath the sword
And for little girls in Birmingham simply worshipping their lord
May I never take for granted
The sacrifice they made
So that I may vote my conscience
May their memory never fade
And to those who would divide us
And feed our apathy
I can hear the people waking up
I can hear them remembering
Just two leagues away
We the people
Send me into the breach, send me into the night
Send me where darkness lingers, let us send our light
Send me like those before and those who've yet to be
Send me, send me
We are standing at the crossroads and the choice is in our hands
Will we choose the path of freedom or will we give up our command
Will we et that we, the people, have a body and a voice
And if we choose to never use them then we will someday lose our choice
But if everyone is counted on that sweet November day
Then the answer will be loud and clear, the world will hear us say
Who will lead us?
We the people
Who will lead us?
We the people
