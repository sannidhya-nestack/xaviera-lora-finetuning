Dogs are barking in the alley as another car rolls by
Headlights swim across the windows and the walls
As a row of weeping willows shudder in the wind
They sound like distant applause
The fireworks are trying to make the moon a saint
As they scatter halos out across the sky
When a breeze sneaks in my window
And moves along the wind chimes
It feels tender as a sigh
It's a slow twilight
Yeah, it's independence night in my neighborhood
Kids are barefoot on the lawn trying to catch fireflies
I'm afraid they aren't having too much luck
And it's hard to believe but the guy across the street
Is still working on his truck
The cry of an ambulance cuts through the night
It wails like an electric guitar
There's a thunderstorm coming, you can taste it in the air
God'll show us what real fireworks are on a slow twilight
On the 4th of July
Yeah it's Independence Night
In my neighborhood
Tomorrow I'll head for work and face the grind again
But all I care about'til then
Is one more slow twilight on the fourth of July
Yeah, it's ending
Independence night in my neighborhood
Yeah, in my neighborhood
