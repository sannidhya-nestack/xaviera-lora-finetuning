You live and learn
To play the game
When this is why
We're all to blame
They take you to your limit when the odds are low
Roll the dice and risk it, watch your money go
We're living on love
Living on luck
Just living on luck
We're all living on luck
Some are rolling high
On this carousel
They're betting blinds
Baby can't you tell, can't you tell
They're living on luck, living on luck
Just living on luck
They're all living on luck, yeah
I'm going slow (going slow) down this river
When the gods return (when the gods return) I'll be the winner
They take you to your limit when the odds are low
Roll the dice and risk it, watch your money go
We're living on love, living on love
Just living on love
We're all living on love
We're all living on love
Oh look, we're all living, oh look, just living
Oh look, we're all living, oh look
