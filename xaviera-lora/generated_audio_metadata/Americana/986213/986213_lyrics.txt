You said goodbye
I hear the eastern Chicago lights
The last words that he said rest upon my mind
And I'm not sure why
But I'm satisfied
I lost a brother gang, this ain't where sinners fly
I see the contrast of an angel streak across the sky
Well maybe that's a lie
But I won't be lost without you
I will never be the same
We got along
A little late for me, I guess time was wrong
But the records and the whiskey gave us one last song
And we sang along
I won't be lost without you, I will never be the same
All the endless teenage fights, arguing who's wrong or right when everybody's wrong
Weaving dreams at 3am, another sleepless night again, man I hate that song
It's how he got along
Man, time sure flies
It's been one long year, winter's here since I got the call
There's nothing left to say, I guess Sweden said it all
After all
Now I won't be lost without you
I won't be lost without you
I will never be the same
No no no no no no
