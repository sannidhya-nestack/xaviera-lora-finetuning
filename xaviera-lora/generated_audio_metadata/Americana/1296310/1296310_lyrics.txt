He looked in her eyes as he heard her reply
Yes I love you but there's something you should know
There's a fire in my soul that can't be controlled
I'm not the girl you loved so long ago
Oh hold me but don't hold me down
I need your love
Lift me higher
The best way to keep me around
Is to hold me but don't hold me down
He flashed her a smile and said, "I think I like your style"
You know you really haven't changed
You're still wild and free but that's just right for me
Can't you see that we are just the same
Oh hold me but don't hold me down (hold me down)
I need your love (I need your love)
Lift me higher (lift me higher)
The best way to keep me around
Is to hold me but don't hold me down
I don't ever want to make the choice
Between the love of my life and living my life
So hold me but don't hold me down (hold me down)
I need your love (I need your love)
Lift me higher (lift me higher)
The best way to keep me around
Is to hold me but don't hold me down
Hold me but don't hold me down
Hold me but don't hold me down
