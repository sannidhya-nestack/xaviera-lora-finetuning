German girl she came to stay
I gave her me bed in the month of May
She gave me the couch I didn't complain I said
Don't worry I'll be back again
We went to the beaches, we went to the bars
We went for long distance drives in the cars
We lay in the sunshine, we laughed in the rain
She said, "Don't worry, I'll be back again"
We ate lots of pizza and lots of ice cream
She said, "I want to live here, it's my dream"
I said, "You're here, you just came on a plane"
She said, "But I have to go back home again"
The bed's big enough for two, you know what I mean
You don't have to go anywhere, you're part of the scene
And if you don't like it, we'll get in a train
Take our time, see the country, then come back again
A German girl, German girl, German girl, a German girl
This woman of mine she was hard to please
In the morning for breakfast she gave crackers and cheese
And made me my coffee I didn't complain she said
She might have to go back home again
The problem was she just couldn't stay now
No work, no money, no papers anyhow
I'll take care of the problem I said
Just say when you'll come back to me darling
Please come back again
But I've only just arrived
I'm not leaving yet
We've got so much time together
Let's not et
Only when the time comes
Only then must I think
About returning to the fatherland again
My German girl
German girl
German girl, I'm a German girl
German girl, I'm a German girl
German girl, I'm a German girl
So I sweated and waited, said I adore the ground she walked on, but she always seemed bored, she still sleeps in my bed, it's been ten years now, ten since I finally asked her to vacate my den
The couch is uncomfortable, I still can't sleep at night
She reads a lot of novels, keeps on the light
I know I was always her special special friend
This fact she keeps reminding me again and again
Friends have dropped by, lovers have called
I'm still learning their names, I'll never know them all
I thought of moving to Germany, but then what then?
I might never see my apartment again
Or my German girl
German girl, German girl
I'm a German girl, German girl, German girl
I'm a German girl, German girl, German girl
I'm a German girl, German girl, German girl
I'm a German girl, German girl, German Girl
I'm a German girl
