I remember when the band used to come to town
Must have been about thirteen out there
In the middle of nowhere
The invaders were laying it down
Went down to old Man Anderson's music store
Got a steel string guitar
Played by the light of the radio
Made my fingers sore but I
Didn't know the price you pay
No I didn't know the price you pay
Left my hometown when I was still a boy
Landed in the city
Played the streets for fifteen bucks a day
And the girls were pretty, I
Didn't know
The price you pay
You can never go back, no babe
That's the price you pay
And it's hard
When you're nowhere
You can never go back, no babe
That's the price you pay
And it's hard when you're down there
Oh I didn't know the price
You paid
No, no, I didn't know
The price you paid
I remember when the band used to come to town
Must have been about thirteen out there
In the middle of nowhere
The invaders were laying it down
