If your lonely day becomes a night
And you feel like you're down to your last tear
If you fear that you're losing the fight
Darling you can put away your fear
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
I'll be coming, come what may
Try to hold on one more day
Help is on the way
Like a bird finds its way out of a tree
I know you'll find your way out of your blues
Like a river finds its way to the sea
Darling I'll find my way back to you
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
I'll be coming, come what may
Try to hold on one more day
Help is on the way
If you ever feel like you've lost me
Put your ear down to the ground
If you listen ever so softly
Darling you'll hear me coming around
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
I'll be coming
Come what may
Try to hold on one more day
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Oh, help is on the way
