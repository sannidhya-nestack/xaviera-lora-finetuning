I know I ain't no good at loving
I just ain't no good at the game
If there is a next time I try harder
Maybe she might even do the same
Last one looked so good from the outside
Turned out she had a heart of stone
Girl just said she loved me for my money
That shit well it left me all alone
Got me a Mississippi heartache
And two dollars left
The shit that I come with
And my wounded pride
Next time I love I hope I don't come back with
A little Mississippi mud in my eye
I now go
You got me a Mississippi heartache
And two dollars left
The shirt that I came with
And my wounded pad
Next time I love
I hope I don't come back with
A little Mississippi mud in my eye
Hey a little Mississippi mud in my eye
Ah a little Mississippi mud in my eye
Not that I'm angry
Just don't want no mud
