I've been thinking a lot about you, about the way you smile
When I'm blue, about the way you see when your eyes meet mine
About the way you kiss me fun and fine
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh, I've been thinking a lot about you, about the way you appear
Within my view, about the way you frown
And a bad joke about the way you sleep when I've awoke
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh, I've been thinking a lot about you
By the way you tell me a story that's new
By the way you hold my hand and yours
By the way you look through an open door
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh, I've been thinking a lot about you
About the way you laugh with me when I do
About the way you talk so sweet to my ear
the way you sit with me so near
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh, I've been thinking a lot about you
About the way you dance when I ask you to
About the way you walk into a room
About the way you want me back so soon
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Let's bring it home.
Bye-bye!
