Hold on baby, it's a long road, it's a hard load
Hold on sweetie, it's a big world of a long road
Hold on sweetheart, it's a strange world, a bizarre world
Hold on sister, it's a long road in this strange world
Trees are tossing, trees are groaning in the wind
I am singing, I am calling, need a hint
Tell me honey, but be honest, where to go?
Call and tell me, oh please tell me yes or no
Hold on baby, be strong baby in this strange world
Hold on baby, hold on sweetheart, it's a long road
Come on honey, call me sweetheart in this cold world
Whisper gently, wish me something for my long road
Trees are tossing, trees are drowning in the wind
I am singing, I am calling need a hint
Tell me honey but be honest where to go
Call and tell me oh please tell me yes or no
Words will fly and words will flutter in the sky
I expect to hear something about you and I
I expect to listen baby all night long
May I tell you at this hour I am wrong
Trees are tossing, trees are groaning in the wind
I am singing, I am calling need a hint
Tell me honey but be honest where to go
Call and tell me oh please tell me yes or no
Trees are tossing, trees are grounding in the wind
I am singing, I am calling, need a hint
Tell me honey, but be honest where to go
Call and tell me, oh please tell me yes or no
