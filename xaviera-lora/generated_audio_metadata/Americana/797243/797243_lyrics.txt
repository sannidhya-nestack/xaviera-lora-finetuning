He made up his mind, hopped in his car
First to the bank, then the jewelry store
He spent every dime, but walked away sad
he could not buy her more
For the special evening
He thought of a yacht floating in the bay
But when he asked for her hand that night
They were parked on the shore in his old Chevrolet
That's when she told him she didn't need much
His love was enough and she wished he could only see
He was all she ever wanted him to be
A job opened up on the management team
It was his chance to make her proud
His boss called him in for an afternoon talk
Said sorry son but not this time around
Walking through their front door
Thinking of how to break the news
Before he got out a word she said
I'm always with you honey
Win or lose
That's when she told him
She didn't need much
His love was enough
And she wished he could only see
He was all she ever wanted him to be
The years went so fast
Then his life began to fade
She stayed by his side
In his final days
And that's when she told him
She didn't need much, his love was enough
And she wished he could only see
He was all she ever wanted him to be
He was all she ever wanted him to be
He smiled and said he was starting to believe
