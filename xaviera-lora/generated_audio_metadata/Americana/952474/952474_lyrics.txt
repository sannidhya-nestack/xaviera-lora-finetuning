She said you wanna get together
Spend your life with me forever
Well come on now and stand here by my side
I'll stand by you from this day forward
For better or worse, for richer or poorer
I'll love you until the end of time
Well, come on now, let's get this party started
et that we were broken hearted
Let's raise a glass of toast to you and me
Mmm, you and me
So you bought your dress and got your friends together
Prayed to God for some sunny weather
Now we're standing here side by side, you and me
Come on babe, take my hand
Tell the preacher that I'll be your man
Say you'll always love me like you do
Well, come on now, let's get this party started
Ain't gonna be for the faint of heart, no
Let's raise a glass and toast to you and me
Mmm, you and me
Well, come on now, let's get this party started
Ain't gonna be for the faint of heart, no
Let's raise a glass and toast to you and me
Go ahead and fill up that solo cup
Hey, someone turn that music up
Let's raise a glass and toast to you and me
And raise a glass and toast to you and me
Let's raise a glass and toast to you and me
