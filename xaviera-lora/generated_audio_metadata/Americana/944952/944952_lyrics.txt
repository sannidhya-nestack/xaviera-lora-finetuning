Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ruby, oh Ruby and you fangled beauty
Lips red like geranium flowers
Eyes like aquamarine
A heart crystalline
With hopes and dreams to spend the hours
Fine gem, a jewel, your parents were cruel
And Sully, your beautiful son
I wish all the day I could steal you away
it seems like they left you behind
Lulu, oh Lulu, I miss you so truly
Where are you, my violet sapphire?
Keep that vermillion hue
To yourself, be true
Never snuff out your heart's fire
Ruby, oh Ruby, to whom I had duties
You languish more than you need bear
They gave you to people, smart specialized people
When all that you needed was care
More time and caressing
More heartfelt undressing
Of the wounds they had flashed on your soul
But they wanted a lifestyle
They wanted to play while
You suffered and were made unwhole
Rua, oh, Rua, I miss you so truly
Where are you, my violet sapphire?
Keep that vermillion hue
To yourself be true
Never snuff out your heart's fire
Life's hard and unyielding, strange and unwieldy
It don't play by any set rules
But trust me on this, your life will be filled with bliss
So don't pay no mind to those fools
Once they see the light
It will be alright
And they'll find you're a choose-a-bear
So for now hold on tight
For they don't know what's right
Chin up baby don't back down
I miss you so truly, where are you my violet sapphire?
Keep that vermilion hue, to yourself be true
Never snuff out your heart's fire
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
