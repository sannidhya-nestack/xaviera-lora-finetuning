Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin
You know it's a shame
Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin
You know it's a shame
Out of Levy's Blue
When Katrina came
Superdome to Houston, from Houston to L .A.
Superdome to Houston, from Houston to L A.
You know there's thousands of people
They were just trying to find their way
Creole Driftwood, they just looking for hope
Creole Driftwood, they just looking for hope
And nobody knows how long they're bound to roam
All along the Gulf Coast
There was just misery and despair
All along the Gulf Coast
There was just misery and despair
How many know this
Tell me how many care
Listen to the music
You got to hear that music play
Listen to the music
Yes, you got to hear that music play
Our Lord knows that music
Gonna lead you on your way
Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin, you know it's a shame
Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin, you know it's a shame
Out of Levy's blue
When Katrina came
