Take me to a sunrise
High on a mountain
I wanna see in your eyes
The first ray of sun
Or take me to an ocean
Or bathe me in the water
A wave of emotion is sweeping over me
Oh take me to the places where the rivers flow
Where the bough frogs sing their song
I wanna see the moon shine
How it lights your face
In a beautiful silver glow
I wish there was a river
To take me home
I wish there was a river to take me home
A beautiful river to carry me home
A winding river leading me
Home, back home (beautiful river)
I wanna go back home (home, back home, beautiful river)
Home, back home (I wanna go back home)
I wish there was a river leading me back home
Take me to the border
Where I can see a future
Standing on a corner
Waiting on you
I look up to the heavens
And I feel the peace
And I hear the water flow
I wish there was a river
To take me home
I wish there was a river to take me home
A beautiful river to carry me home
A winding river leading me
Home, back home (beautiful reason)
I wanna go back home (back home, beautiful reason)
Home, I wanna go back home (beautiful reason)
I wish there was a river leading me home
