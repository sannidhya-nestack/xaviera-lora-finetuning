Ain't nothing I can do
There ain't nothing I can say
Ain't nothing left to feel
But whatever's gone your way
Your words were very clear
Not to be second guessed
My best laid loving plans
They ain't nothing but a mess
I ain't got a lick of pride
In this ugly situation
Though I'm happy just to be alive
Though I know I got your love salvation
But it wasn't so long ago
Your love for me was pure
Then in a breath you rolled on me
As you headed out the door
It's a fact that nothing ever changes
When it comes to loss and love
When your storm for me arranges
The showdown that's in store for later
Know nothing, know nothing, know nothing
So go and seek a new love
And you can have yourself a natural home
While you're dancing on my empty shelf
You put the past behind us all
There ain't nothing I can do
Ain't nothing I can say
Ain't nothing left to feel
So I best be on my way
Ain't nothing I can do
Ain't nothing left to say
