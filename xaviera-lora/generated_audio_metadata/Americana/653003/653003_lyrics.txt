Ah, you said I got it coming
You're right, I do
I wouldn't get too excited if I were you
And when it looks like I'm losing it all
Standing there and ready to fall
Believe in me that's my advice
Count me out but you better think twice
Just when you think I'm going down again
Don't bet against me darling
Cause that'll never win
Ah, you say I got it coming, we all do
I'd take a look in the mirror if I were you
You've gotta show me something a little bit more
I said it once and I meant it before
Believe in me that's my advice
Count me out but you better think twice
Just when you think I'm going down again
Don't bet against me darling
Cause that'll never win
And when it looks like I'm losing it all
Standing there and ready to fall
Believe in me that's my advice
Count me out but you better think twice
Just when you think I'm going down again
Don't bet against me darling
Cause that'll never win
That'll never win
That'll never win
No
