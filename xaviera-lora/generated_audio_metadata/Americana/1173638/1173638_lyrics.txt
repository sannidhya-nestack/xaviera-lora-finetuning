In San Antonio, I want to take a ride down towards the mora
Sweet little you by my side and when we hit a little bump
It sounds kinda funny, we smile to each other
And keep right on and turn right on Culebra
Slide along like a snake, got no problemas
And everything is just great
And when it gets a little later and the sun goes down
We're going to a dance out on the Frio City Road
You tell the young and old, we got some songs they'll know
And they can dance exactly like they wanna
Way out free on city road, poker
Once on St. Mary's, I went a little insane
Stopped at a red light and started dancing with my baby
Then the light turned blue, the police come
They seen what was a happening and they all threw down their guns
You tell the young and old, they'll hear some songs they know
And they can dance exactly like they wanna
Way out for your city road poker
You tell the young and old
They'll hear some songs they know
And they can dance exactly like they wanna
Way out free on city road poker
