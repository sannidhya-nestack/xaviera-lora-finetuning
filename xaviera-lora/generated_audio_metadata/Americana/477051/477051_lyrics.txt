My, my, how I miss that prairie sky
Where the northern lights light up the night for me
The coyotes lonely call to harvest in the fall
The wheat fields stretch as far as I can see
Wind begins to whine down that elevator line
Hot and dusty prairie summer day
In a field far away I see someone bailing hay
Hope it doesn't rain on him today
Prairie gold, I miss the sound of silence on winter nights
And I miss those long summer days
And I miss you more and more with every passing day
Makes me wish I'd never gone away
Down to that old slough with my trusty twenty-two
While away the hours day by day
Me and my best friend partners till the end
I wonder where my partner is today
Prairie gold, I miss the sound of silence on winter nights
I miss those long summer days
I miss you more and more with every passing day
Makes me wish I'd never gone away
Yeah, pray me gold, I miss the sound of silence on winter nights
And I miss those long summer days
And I miss you more and more with every passing day
Makes me wish I'd never gone away
I wish I'd never gone away
