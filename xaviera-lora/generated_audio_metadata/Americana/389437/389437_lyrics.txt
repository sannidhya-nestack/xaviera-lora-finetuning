Was a soldier, she was a friend
Was a protector on who we could depend
She was a woman as tough as nails
With a heart of gold that would not fail
She was a hero, came on the run
The shots rang out, she shed her blood
The town fell silent, no songbird sang
Gone but not otten, the church bells rang
And we can only wonder why
The good ones die before their time
Angel wings, I'm sure she'll find
A reward for the ultimate sacrifice
She was a leader, helped to keep us strong
She was a teacher, taught us right from wrong
Just like a lighthouse, she showed the way
A loving beacon
That will shine always
And we can only wonder why
The good ones die before their time
Angel wings, I'm sure she'll find
A reward for
The ultimate sacrifice
The ultimate sacrifice
Angel wings I'm sure she'll find
