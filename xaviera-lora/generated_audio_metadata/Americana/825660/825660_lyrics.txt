Time has taken everything he's known
The women and their love and broken homes
That picket fence ain't nothing but a dream he used to have
While riding that old highway all alone
Just a outlaw with no way to go back home
From the edges of the life he never meant to know
He walks as tall as any lonesome stranger
As his long hair turns to grey, the years will fade away
He lived as if there wasn't any danger
Oh, time has taken everything he's known
The women and the love and broken homes
That picket fence ain't nothing but a dream he used to have
While riding that old highway all alone
Just an outlaw with no way to go back home
He rolled that rigid frame through the California rain
Bars were shoulder high against the wind
Riding through the bends where the ocean highway ends
With the rain dripping off his jacket fringe
Oh time has taken everything he's known
The women and the loving broken home
That picket fence ain't nothing but a dream he used to have
While riding that old highway all alone
Just an outlaw with no way to go back home
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Yet he still keeps on rollin' down that wasted road to ruin
Wishin' for a chance at one more try
That wild law rider still remains a fighting man
Fighting for a reason to survive
Fighting for some reason to survive
