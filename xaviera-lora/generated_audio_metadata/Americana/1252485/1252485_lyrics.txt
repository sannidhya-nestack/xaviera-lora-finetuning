Well, I don't mind and I don't care
I never needed you that much anyway
You know your head is in the clouds
And your feet so rarely touch the floor
Why don't you go on back to your mother, babe?
I don't need no more
Your mom she likes me and she told me as much
She baked me chocolate cake and filled it up with love
With sugar frosted icing and I let her return from her haunt, amen
She said it's a shame and I will miss you
Not hanging round my kitchen anymore, amen
I should've left you there a long time ago
But that roast beef on a Sunday keeps me coming back for more
Why don't you move on back to your mother, baby?
I don't need no more
And I wish I was dead
Well, I'm alright and I don't care
I never needed you that much anyway
Got me a whole lot of money and a whole lot of love and truth
Why don't you go on back to your mother, baby?
She told me she wanna talk with you
But I tell her, well I don't mind and I don't care
I never liked you that much anyway
I know your head is in the clouds
And your feet so ready to touch the floor
Why don't you go on back to your mother, baby?
I don't need no more
