The sun is rising in the sky
Hoping that the fog will lift for me
there ain't no time to worry about the clouds
That are hanging over me
The road behind stays on my mind
Road ahead is all that I should see
Hope that you'll come ride with me and alleviate my constant misery
Head out for a ride, feel the breeze
Push it down the road as you please
Come on, get up on your bike and ride with me
I'm so happy that you're here now
So take another ride with me
There's a smile on my face you can't erase
You know there ain't no place that I would rather be
Road is looking better now that you are out here
Riding it with me
Hope that you'll stay by my side
We can ride in perfect harmony
Head out for a ride, feel the breeze
Push it down the road as you please
Come on get up on your bike and ride with me
Windy road is all I know
Nothing straight but that's alright by me
Up and down these hills I go
It's another roller coaster ride for me
Smile from you, well more than do
You know it's all that really matters, can't you see?
Hope that you'll stay by my side
We can ride in perfect harmony
Head out for a ride, feel the breeze
Push it down the road as you please
Come on, get up on your bike, ride with me
Come on, get up on your bike
