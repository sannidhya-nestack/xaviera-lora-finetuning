I am black, I am white
Yellow, brown and red
But call me American (Call me, call me)
Call me American (Call me American)
Yeah, I'm Asian and Caucasian
African and Latin, but call me American (Call me, call me)
Call me American (Call me)
'Cause I live in a land where I'm supposed to be free
And presumed innocent until I'm proven guilty
I'm a woman, I'm a man
Single, married, divorced, but call me American (Call me, call me)
Call me American (Call me American)
Call me American (Call me)
I am Christian, I am pagan, Jewish and Islam
And I don't need a hyphen to tell you who I am
I am young, I am old
Middle Asian, unborn
But call me American (Call me, call me)
Call me American (Call me, American)
Call me American
Call me American (Call me, American)
Call me American (Call me, American)
Call me American (Call me, American)
Call me
American, American, call me American, call me, call me, American, call me American, call me, call me, call me
