Now everybody sayin' the monkey had to come and chew
He'd done for thirty years but he didn't see that one come
The old town is dry and there's nothing we can do about it
The monkey's been away for about a hundred years now
Now little piggy said that he heard about a man who could drive it into town
And it charges a lump for money
But it ain't the same
Say monkey, monkey, where are you?
Monkey, monkey, don't let it chew
I wrote a letter to the monkey
There's a queue of people waiting
We all got monkey money
And we're desperate to get a little
We're pacing the streets
And we're trying to be polite
And we roll a little thing
But we got nothing to put inside it
My cupboard is bare
I wrote a letter to the judge
Asking him for mercy
Trying to make him see that we're missing
I miss the monkey
And it ain't the same, babe
Say monkey, monkey, now where are you?
Now monkey, monkey, don't let it be true
Monkey, monkey, now where are you?
Now monkey, monkey, don't let it be true
