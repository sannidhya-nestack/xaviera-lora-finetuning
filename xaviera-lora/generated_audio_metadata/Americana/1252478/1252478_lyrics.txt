So angel, she has a holding hand
An angel has a holding hand
So angel she has this holding hand
She likes to share it when she can
This angel has a whole lot of desire to rely upon
Angel has a holding hand
Now angel she wants to dance with me
She asked me so
If you please
Angel has a whole lot of dancing inside of her
Angel wants to dance with me
So, now Angel dear, won't you dance with me?
Won't you worship me once this one?
Now, Angel, do you want you? Oh, see me, want you? Don't say I may, while she's right there
So angel, here's a holding hand
Now angel, here's a holding hand
Now angel, she wants some time with me
She wants to explain, so I will see
She prays to heaven, baby, a girl or boy, baby
Now Angel, she has a plan for me
Now Angel, dear, won't you dance with me?
Won't you? Oh, ça fait quoi ce soir?
Now, angel, do you want to dance with me, want you?
Dance avec moi ce soir
Now, angel, do you want to dance with me, want you?
Danse avec moi ce soir
