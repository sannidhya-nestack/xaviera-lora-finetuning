There is a new show come to town
I see'em moving in the fields outside of town
See they're putting up the tents and tying them down
I hope it's a good show for us all
A new show for us all to see
I'm reading right here off their marquee
You can't read it says we're all gonna get in free
And it's a good show for us all
Is it going to be the fair?
Is it going to be alright?
Or shall we leave it like the last one?
Will the weather hold out'til the opening night?
Or will the rains make liars of us all?
Say it for me over there
Is it gonna be the foul? Is it gonna be alright?
Shall we believe it like the last one?
Will the weather hold out till the opening night?
Or will the rains make liars of us all?
There is a new show come to town
Now seeming to me that it's much like the old one
The only difference being that I've been sold before
The only difference being I've been sold this show before
Love
