Walking down the middle path
I once went through a field of clover
But now it's a rough and rocky road
I had better stop and get it over
No one knows that I am here
And here I sit and write
All about my plight
Which I hope to overcome
There are so many roads
And there are so many signs
That despair may come at times
I will discover free will
Time to create a change
With these I will find
My middle path again
I work so hard all day
I find reward in the heart of a true way
Row your logs in my way
So that I may add value to another day
Let me work, let me play
Have me said, have me seen
I will toss them away and carry on
Until another one falls my way
I study all night, you know
I play piano, I sing my song
But I never stay in one place too long
I'll never follow a side path to its end
To find you in my middle path again
You in my middle path again
