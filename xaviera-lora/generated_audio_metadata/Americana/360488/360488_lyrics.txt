Since you've been gone, I'm kinda fragile
Soft spoken, got no groove
I'm missing something, I can't name it
I know it's close and I'm looking for clues
I'm aware of every detail
There's only so much my eyes can see
I wish I didn't have to blink sometimes
In that moment you're away from me
I think I need a better radar
If I'm ever gonna find a heart
Something stronger, something better
Love's for nothing when it falls apart
I'm the reason we've gotten this far
I struck the match to light your room
I went looking where I really should nap
It was good but it was gone too soon
Think I need a better radar
If I'm ever gonna find a heart
Something stronger, something better
Love's for nothing when it falls apart
Love's for nothing when it falls apart
I'm not gonna give up
No I won't give up on love
My dreams are far too close to me
I think I need a better radar
If I'm ever gonna find a heart
Something stronger, something better
Love's for nothing when it falls apart
Love's for nothing when it falls apart
