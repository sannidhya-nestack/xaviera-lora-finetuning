No one could hear her crying
Crying for her freedom
We never saw no liars
Pulling at her from behind
To her every link's identical
And now the sun still heats their metal
So many days she wasted
She was caught up in her chains
I see that setting was her comfort
After quite a while
She had no intent to walk away
No more than half a mile
She grew contempt and blind
She'd stay behind the lines
I could have heard her unspoken words
Caught up in her chains
But she took her chains so far away
And now I'll never see them shine
In the clear blue morning sky
While they bind my heart to cry
That girl would never listen
To my words of sense, no how
She took them chains away
The only way that she knew how
Now I knew these dreams were wasted
For all them thousand hours
It seems one thousand days she wasted
Caught up in her chains
Now she took her chains so far away
And now I'll never see them shine
In the clear blue morning sky
While they bind my heart to cry
That a girl would never listen
To my words of sand and snow high
She took her chains away
It's all over now
You know she took them chains away
And it's all over now
