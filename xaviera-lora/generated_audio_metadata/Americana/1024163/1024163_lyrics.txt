April Friday, New York Midtown lights
Change my shirt, join a civilian night
My life is made of stories
Some about me and some about you
Touch the strings and let'em ring true
My friends all ask me
Kenny what's it like on Magic Street
Well it always smells like summer
There's always plenty of wine
Sit on the porch in the soft rain
Never worry about time
Down on Magic Street
Down on Magic Street
So how you wanna do this baby
I guess I should have asked before
I got a little distracted as we slipped to the floor
Now that I've got my second wind
We're gonna try this all over again
Ask how they're gonna know what to look for
My friends all ask me
Can it watch it like a magic stray
Well it always smells like summer
There's always plenty of wine
Sit on the porch in the soft rain
Never worry about time
Down on Magic Street
Down on Magic Street
It's here in the moment
Only this, only now
Tonight it's yours for the price of a smile
My friends all ask me
Can it watchin' like a magic streak
Well it always smells like summer
There's always plenty of wine
Sit on a porch in the soft rain
You never worry about time
Down on Magic Street
Down on Magic Street
Well it always smells like summer
It's always plenty of wine
To sit on a porch in the soft rain
And never worry about time
Down on Magic Street
Down on Magic Street
