We are the way out, way out, way out, out, out, out
We are the way out, way out, way out, out, out, out
We are the way out, way out, way out, out, out, out
We are the way out, way out, way up, up, up
We are the way out, way out, way down
I'm gonna make it through the night, I'm gonna make it through the night, I'll make it through the night, I'll make it through the night, I'll make it through the night
We are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way, we are the way
(I'm not afraid of the dark, I'm not afraid of the light)
