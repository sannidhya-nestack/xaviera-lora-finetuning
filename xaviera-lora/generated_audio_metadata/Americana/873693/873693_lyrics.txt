When I was a younger boy I soon gave up on all the toys
I knew that they would never really save me
And as a man I ran to you faster than my leather shoes
They always weighed me down my hands and feet were on the ground
I took another chance to find the good life, the good life
I'm just a man on a plane
Making my way up to meet you on the silver lining
I'm gonna learn how to fly
To say goodbye you gotta spread your wings to land upon the good life
Close your eyes and take my hand
Don't you know it ain't that easy to land a parachute
If you need me, I'll be falling for you
Bear a shoe
If you call for me, I'll reach out for you
I'm taking off my leather shoes
I'm falling fast, so hard for you
I took another chance to find the good life, the good life
Good luck
When the day brings a thousand little pieces of your heartbeat
Back to me, back again so easily
Pounding faster than a beautiful heart
For disaster, won't you hold me just a little closer
Roller coaster's tipping over
Barefoot on the edge of town
My heartbeat was the only sound
I took another chance to find the good life
The good life
I'm just a man on a plane
Making my way up to meet you on the silver lining
I'm gonna learn how to fly
It's easier this time
To make a landing in the good life, the good life
Close your eyes and take my hand (take my hand)
Don't you know it ain't that easy to land parachute
If you need me I'll be falling for you
Parachute
If you call for me, I'll reach out for you
I'm taking off my leather shoes
I'm rolling past so hard for you
I took another chance to find the good life
The good life
