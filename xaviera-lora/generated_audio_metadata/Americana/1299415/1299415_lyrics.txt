Come on down to the Mardi Gras
Hang around on the Fourth of March
Join all that walks the grand parade
Feast on the pancakes that Tuesday
Let the music fill your soul
Dance in the streets, let the good times roll
Won't you come on down to the Mardi Gras
Hang a wrap on the fourth of March
Join all the parts of grand parade
Feast on the pancakes, fat Tuesday
Let the music fill your soul
Dance in the street at the good times roll
Won't you come on down to the Mardi Gras
Hang around on the 4th of March
Join all the folks at Grand Parade
Feast on the pancakes, fat to stay
Let the music fill your soul
Dance in the streets, let the good times roll
Won't you come on down to the Mardi Gras
Hang around on the 4th of March
Join on in, watch the grand parade
Feast on the pancakes, fat Tuesday
Let the music fill your soul
Dance in the streets, let the good times roll
Won't you come on down to the modern ground?
Hang around on the 4th of March
Join on and watch the grand parade
Feast on the pancakes that Tuesday
Let the music fill your soul
Dance in the street, let the good times roll
We left the good time to roll
