You came around when I wasn't looking
Now I'm in your kitchen eating your cooking
You made me feel pretty good inside
Come on baby now let's go for a ride
Here we go again
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Give me time if you will
Help me over that hill
Here we go
Here we go again
Twenty years maybe more
It's been a long time that's for sure
Pretty soon I'm gonna get it right
Come on baby now let's go out tonight
Here we go again
Say goodnight now I'm back again
Hold me close hold me tight
Stay with me through the night
Here we go, here we go again
Dry the tears from your eyes
Another drink, let it be nice
Tell me the story of your life
Tell me what you think is right
Here we go, here we go again
