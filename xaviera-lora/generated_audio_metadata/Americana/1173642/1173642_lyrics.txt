I'd like to thank you folks
For coming to the show
Me and the band are rearing to go
We worked on a list of the songs in the set
And now it's time to do what we do best
Now it's time to do what we do best
And when we're done
You et the rest
So close your eyes
Take a real deep breath
Now it's time to do what you do best
I'd like to thank my mama
For some good advice
She said mustn't hate
And be polite
What my daddy said
It put me to the test
He said now it's time
To do what you do best
And now it's time
To do what you do best
when you're done
I et to rest
Close your eyes
Take a real deep breath
now it's time
To do what you do best
I'd like to thank my baby for loving me
I'd like to thank the good Lord
Let it be, let it be
I hope everybody in here get everything they deserve
You got to serve somebody before you get served
Now it's time to do what you do best when you're done
We'll et the rest
Close your eyes
Take a real deep breath
Now it's time to do what you do best
There's no time like the right time
And the nighttime is the right time
Time
