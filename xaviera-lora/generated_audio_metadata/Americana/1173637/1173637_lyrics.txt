You can go to Lubbock, you ain't gonna find me there
You can go to Flattown, you won't find me there
Got my four-piece combo diggers on the road somewhere
I had a real good job at Modern Chevrolet
No, I had a real good job at Modern Chevrolet
But I told the truth and drawed my take up faith
Told the truth
Now come in here with me on this thing
Right, right
One more time
Well I missed three payments and they come pick up my truck
I missed only three payments and they come pick up my truck
Another dry year, another brother out of luck
Yeah, terrible thing'bout the high west Texas plains
Oh, terrible thing'bout the high west Texas plains
Flat town boogie all night, hit the flat town blues all day
You can't go to lover, you ain't gonna find me there
You can search all over Satan, you ain't gonna find me there
Got my ex at the pawn shop, squeeze it round the world somewhere
I'm gonna squeeze it down at Stubb's BBQ, mmm good
Stubb's moving around, so can you
Do the flat town boogie
