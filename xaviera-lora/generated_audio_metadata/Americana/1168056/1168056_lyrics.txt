Hello baby, what you say I'm doing on the phone
I just had to talk to you, just once in a while
Easily laughing, I can hear you smile
Leaves are falling
Yellow and red
And I call in
Hear that voice in your head
Days getting saner
Year after year
I feel it wailing
Now the end is near
Take just a few minutes out of our lives
We don't act on it, no we take our advice
You put me together then you take me apart
Please blow it around us like pieces of hearts
Blowing around much like snow in the sky
Had to talk now I can't tell you why
I just had to talk to you just for old times sake
Someone I loved once there were no mistakes
But there ain't no answer
I hang up the phone
I head to the talk
So I ain't so alone
Can't leave you no message
Others could hear
What I got to say
Only if it's yours
Telephone ringing
It's you on the line
Calling calling
Star 69
We're taking it over
Over the telephone
We're taking it over
Over the telephone
We're taking it over, over the telephone (over the telephone)
Taking it over, over the telephone (over the telephone, over the telephone)
Over the telephone, taking it over
Over the telephone, mmm
