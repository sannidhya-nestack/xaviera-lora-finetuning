Hide me so close
So no one can see
How pretty you are
How far you can see
She was just like me, she was just like you
She was just like me, she was just like him
She was just like me
She was just like you
She was just like me
She was just like you
She's our baby star
Falling from the skies
Human to this world
So happy she cries
She was just like me
She was just like you
She was just like me, she was just like you
She was just like me
She was just like you
She was just like you
She was just like me
She was just like you
She was just like you
