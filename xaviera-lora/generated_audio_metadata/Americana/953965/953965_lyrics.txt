I've looked around
I've finally found a true love
Can't wait to see
How life will be with my new love
My daddy always told me
Son, you best not fool around
Make that girl your wife
And have some kids and settle down
The day we met
I can't et how I felt inside
I always knew
I'd be with you and you'd be by my side
We'll walk this life together hand in hand through thick and thin
We'll keep the faith and trust and love right'til the very end
So Nelly come and walk with me
Take me by the hand
Spread your wings and fly away
Me across this land
Time to stand my friend there's plain to see
When Nelly walks with me
As we grow old, our lives unfold right before our eyes
Through all the pains, our love remains and it stays alive
And now I understand that two are better than one
What God has joined together can never be undone
So Nelly, come and walk with me, take me by the hand
Spread your wings and fly away with me across this land
Time is now, my friend, that's plain to see
When Nelly walks with me
And now I understand that two are better than one
What God has joined together can never be undone
So Nelly come and walk with me
Take me by the hand
Spread your wings and fly away
Me across this land
Time is now my friend that's plain to see
When Nelly walks with me
Oh time is now my friend there's a plane to see
When Nelly walks with me
