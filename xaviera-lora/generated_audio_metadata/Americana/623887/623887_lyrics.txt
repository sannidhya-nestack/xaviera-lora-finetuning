Down in New Orleans
You know what's a sin
You know what's a shame
Down in New Orleans
You know what's a sin
You know what's a shame
As the leaves bloom
When Katrina came
From the Dome to Houston
From Houston to LA
Super Dome to Houston
From Houston to LA
There's thousands of people
Just trying to find their way
Creon Driftwood
They're just looking for a home
Creon Driftwood
Just looking for a home
And nobody knows
How long they're bound to roam
All along the Gulf Coast
It's just ruin and despair
All along the Gulf Coast
Just ruin and despair
Did anybody notice?
Does anybody even care?
Listen to the music
You got to hear that music play
Listen to the music
You got to hear that music play
Lord knows that music
Is gonna lead you on your way
Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin, you know it's a shame
Down in New Orleans
You know it's a sin, you know it's a shame
As the leaves bloom
When cat treat again?
Oh yeah
