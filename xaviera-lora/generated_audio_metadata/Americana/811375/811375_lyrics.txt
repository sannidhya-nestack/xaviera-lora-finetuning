I watched you fill your suitcase and strip your closet's bed
When I tried to tell you I no longer cared
You gathered up your toothpaste and your makeup kit
And I start to realize this is probably it
If you leave me, can I come along?
Can I move with you as you're moving on?
I just wanna keep my pillow next to yours where it belongs
If you leave me, can I come along?
You know it sometimes happens beyond our control
And we end up holding back when we should let go
No matter where it started don't care if it's right or wrong
All I need to know is if you leave me can I come along
If you leave me, can I come along?
Can I move with you as you move along?
I just wanna keep my pillow next to yours where it belongs
If you leave me, can I come along?
I know that in the past I haven't been that strong
But this time I'll be rocked for you to fall back on
Oh if you need me can I come along
Can I move with you as you're moving on?
I just want to keep my pillow next to yours if it longs
If you leave me, can I come along?
If you leave me, can I come along?
