I'm writing you this letter to help me remember
My life is more than this bloody war
I vowed to serve my country
I vowed to be your husband
And both I would die for
Been deployed overseas
Forever it seems
Staring at your picture gets me through
But now more than ever
I wish we were together
So I could tell you I love you
But they'll be sending me home soon
So I can tell you face to face
But hold on to this letter
Just in case
On a sunny day by the sea
Got down on one knee
You made my life with your reply
I was the luckiest man alive
And the world's most beautiful bride
To share a first dance on the fourth of July
And I can fight another day
Through gun fires and grenades
Because you're saving me with these memories
I cross miles of oceans above bright white explosions
Your love is the courage in me
They'll be sending me home soon
So I can thank you face to face
But hold on to this letter
Just in case
Just in case
Well I heard this morning our baby girl was born
Please give her a kiss for me
And say that daddy loves her
And I hope she understands
I missed her birthday for her country
But they'll be sending me home soon
So I can meet her face to face
But hold on to this letter
Just in case
Just in case
Just in case
