Your rent man called and he said you hadn't paid your rent for two months
You are not moving back in here
I ain't having no grown kids at my house
You gotta get yourself a real job
Musicians don't make no money, you know that
I look at life stretched out in front of me
All I see is opportunity
If I could only figure out what I'm gonna be when I grow up
I tried working in the oil fields
Couldn't stand the way it made me feel
Oh, getting that black stuff all up my nose
And all over my fancy clothes
Whoa, whoa, I kept finding it on my clothes
Well, I tried white collar crime but I couldn't cut the math
I tried the clergy but I couldn't find no path
And by the time I figure out how to work the internet
Disney probably will have bought and ruined it
Hey, I know I gotta find a way I'm gonna go
And by this time I guess I oughta know
And if I don't I better figure out what I'm gonna do when I grow up
If it ever happens that I grow up
I got this friend that plays rock and roll guitar, you know
Gets to sleep late every day
And he spends his life in bars
Oh, the girls, they all wiggle when he bangs that thing and shouts
Maybe my friend can help me out, whoa, whoa
Maybe some guitar lessons that'll help me out
Pentatonic please
Good, arpeggio
Uh-huh, pentatonic
Now chromatic
Now walk the blues
Very good
You get a B minus
Now hand me the guitar and move over
Teacher's gonna take ten bars
When I grow up
When I grow up
If I grow up
When I grow up
When I grow up
I keep getting these unsolicited letters from the AARP
I'm just a young man, what's it got to do with me
I see McCartney's on the cover of the monthly magazine
And I think I know what that means
Whoa, whoa, I'm pretty sure I know what that means
Hi mom it's me (son it's you) yeah I know it's late
But I got some news and I think it's pretty great
You know I think I finally figured out what I'm gonna do when I grow up
Don't cry mama what I'm gonna do when I grow up (you out playing music)
You need to get out and get a real job, musician my foot
What's wrong with you boy?
And besides, I'm tired of you bringing your clothes over here to my house to wash
Ooh, get your own house
I'm gonna retire
When I
Son, could you just move that lawn chair over in the shade for me? The sun keeps moving
When I
Oh, and while you're up, could you just kinda freshen up that gin and tonic for me? That's a good lad
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
