Me and my fiddle are having a beer
Layin' mouth of the toby and trippin' upstairs
There's a moon at the window makes me wish you were here
Me and my fiddle are having a beer
Rye whiskey and hipsters ever ruined my town
The rent's going up and the sun's going down
But when I think about you it all fades away
You're my inspiration when I sit down to play
You're my inspiration when I sit down to play
Me and my fiddle are having a beer
Playing mouth of the toe beak and tripping up stairs
There's a moon at the window makes me wish you were here
Yeah me and my fiddle are having a beer
When I was young I had big dreams and plans
Most have come true but some slipped through my hands
But with your hand in mine I'm dreaming awake
Oh there's music to play and sweet love to make
Yes there's music to play and sweet love to make
There are ghosts in the desert that won't give up the ghost
But yours is the spirit that I love the most
When I think about you it always makes me smile
I'm coming to see you, gonna be there awhile
I'm coming to see you, gonna be there awhile
Yeah, me and my fiddle are having a beer
Laying my puff of toby and tripping up stairs
There's a moon at the window makes me wish you were here
Yeah, me and my fiddle are having a beer
Me and my fiddle are having a beer
