Well, the cars are in a line
Going five feet a minute
Just like every day before
Well, the red race is fine
And everybody's trying to win it
But I can't help but ask what for?
Would you love me if I was a farmer
Would you love me if I worked the land
Would you love me if I was a farmer
Would you still be there to hold my calloused hand
Would you still be there to hold my dirty hand?
Only got one life to live
And this is what I'm doing
But it sure seems like a waste of time
Well, I'm chasing after gold
While the kids are raised and naked
And I'm slowly going out of my mind
Would you love me if I was a farmer?
Would you love me if I worked the land?
Would you love me if I was a farmer?
Would you still be there to hold my calloused hand?
Would you still be there to hold my dirty hand?
There's a hunger in my heart
To move out in the country
And settle down on a nice piece of land
Buy some cows and pigs and chickens
And grow a great big garden
And turn myself into a simple man
Would you love me if I was a farmer
Would you love me if I worked the land
Would you love me if I was a farmer
Would you still be there to hold my calloused hand
Would you still be there to hold my dirty hand?
Would you love me if I was a farmer?
Would you love me if I worked the land?
Would you love me if I was a farmer?
Would you still be there to hold my calloused hand
Would you still be there to hold my dirty hand
