Bordello wine, Bordello wine
Make my baby feel good all the time
She drinks it from the bottle while I wait here in line
She's sippin' on that sweet Bordello wine
Pont Rouge Bordeaux, Pont Rouge Bordeaux
Well, I don't know why I want that woman so
She takes all of my money when she leaves me by the hand
But I can't help but give her all I can
She don't drink the water
She don't wanna drink the beer
For her it's just bordello wine every time
Bordello wine, Bordello wine
Make my baby feel good all the time
She drinks it from the bottle
While I wait here in line
She's sippin' on that sweet Bordello wine
Mon Rouge Bordeaux, Mon Rouge Bordeaux
Well, I don't know why I want that woman so
She take all of my money when she leads me by the hand
But I can't help but give her all that I can
She don't want to drink the water
She don't want to drink the beer
If it were with portillo wine every time
Bodele wine, bodele wine
Really make my baby feel good all the time
she drinks it from the bottle while I wait here in line
She's sippin' on that sweet bodele wine
Oh, oh, oh, sippin' on that sweet Bordello wine
