I'm not looking for somebody new
Cupid and me have agreed on a truce
I've given in, I've given all, I've given up
So I'm running, running from love
I'll find a cabin way out in the woods
That pure country air just might do me some good
In mother nature's hands who needs a woman's touch
I'll keep on running, running from love
I'll be running from love hoping I won't run into a dead end
It's gonna take a long, long time
For my broken heart to mend until then
I'll be running from love
I've slipped and stumbled and fallen before
I'm tired of picking myself up off the floor
I need a vacation from all the above
I'm running, running from love
I'll be running from love hoping I won't run into a dead end
It's gonna take a long, long time
For my broken heart to mend
Until then
I'll be running from love
Until then
I'll be running from love
