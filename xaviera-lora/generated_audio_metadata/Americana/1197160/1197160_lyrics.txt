I ain't half-assed, I ain't stupid, man, and you ain't foolin' me
Think I got your measure and your measure don't fit me
You can talk a bunch of words, hit me dictionary
Hopin' I won't get it, man, but I get what you mean
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You wanna mess with history, you wanna rearrange the track
Put another slant on it,'cause it don't chime with where you're at
You got means, you got the method, I've seen a way you hang your hat
But the truth of the truth is, you don't get where the truth is at
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
Your anima justiculates your body language talks
Your face man it's a picture, a map of all your thoughts
I read just what your game is and where your compass points
In every word you choose to use I hear what's in that voice
I think I got your measure and your measure don't fit me
I think I got your measure and your measure don’t fit me
You dig that?
You dig that?
You can run it down a rabbit hole and make it disappear
Let the online media turn to half-truth interfere
And when it's in that dark place, black without a face
Money's disappeared and you got shares in that sad place
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
So you're trying to bamboozle yeah or run a line on me
I've got street inside of me and every angle man I see
Every long shot every low blow man I've lived I've breathed
Me I don't do dumb struck I do trust and honesty
You dig that
You dig that
You dig that
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
You dig that?
