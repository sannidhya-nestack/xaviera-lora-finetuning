Got a sweet little thingy in San Antone
Works all day at the C's alone
Got a brother locked up in the county jail
Won't let him out till folks is paid
Friday night, half past one
Pack my bag, grab my gun
Hit the bank, grab the cash, out the door like a flash
You left, I'll right, we'll slip off into the night
Down the road, off the waves, cops are waiting in a haze
Trains coming down the track, it's all alone, we ain't coming back
You look left, I look right, we'll slip off tonight
Morning news tells a story
Two horned men bound for glory
Lock the door, there's ain't no roos out there somewhere on the loose
You look left, I look right, we'll slip off to the night
Trains rollin' down the track
Wheels turnin', kickin' and clackin'
In the Tulsa, half past ten, that whiskey blowin' down there
Split the money, jumped the train, caught a 18-wheeler in the pouring rain
Fifty whiskey and a bottle of wine, hitting up north to the land of the alive
You look left, I look right, it's the fall tonight
You look left, I look right, it's the fall tonight
