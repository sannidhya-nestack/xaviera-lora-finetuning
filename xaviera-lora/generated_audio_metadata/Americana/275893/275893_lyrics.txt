(Humming)
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
America! America! God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
America, America, God, man, thine every flaw
O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self
Their country loved
And mercy more than life
Oh beautiful for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears. America! America! God shed His grace on thee.
And crown our good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
America
