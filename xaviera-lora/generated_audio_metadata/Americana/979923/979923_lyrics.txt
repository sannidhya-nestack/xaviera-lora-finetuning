My name is John, they call me Tucker
And my story's long before your time
My only sin in life, I was a moonshiner
With my partner Billy Joe, goodbye
Now Billy Joe, he was a gambler
Lost his house, his money and his wife
But I pulled his carcass from the gutter
Couldn't stand to see him lose his life
We built those steels on top of Stigler's mountains
Run that liquor through till it was pure
Behind my back that barely took to stealing
Well I guess pity ain't no gambling cure
And I never stood a chance as he lay waiting
Hiding in the bushes with his powder dry
And those shots rang out across those Stigler mountains
And they hung him from the gallows high
The sheriff and his men they came together
And those whiskey stills got broken down
Flowin' like my blood into the river
And they call it Whiskey River now
And I never stood a chance as he lay waiting
Hiding in the bushes with his powder dry
And those shots rang out across those Stigler mountains
And they hung him from the gallows high
I left behind a wife and seven children
Ways that I could have made them understand
That my regrets were not for whiskey making
But for gambling with a gambling man
And I never stood a chance as he lay waiting
Hiding in the bushes with his powders dry
And those shots rang out across those Stigler mountains
And they hung him from the gallows high
Yes they hung him from the gallows high
