The moon shone bright, illuminating bad intentions
The blood ran hot, staring in the fire's reflection
Now come on boys, let's move it in the right direction
You know hearts, they'll get into it every time
The girl was fine, a little too fine to mention
A pulse ran quick when she gave you her attention
A sudden look flickered in the fire's reflection
You know hearts, they'll get into it every time
You know hearts
You know hearts
You know hearts
You know hearts
The moon was high, witness to a situation
No one backs down, leading to an escalation
Now come on boys, you're headed in the wrong direction
You know hearts
They'll get into it every time
You know hearts
You know hearts
You know hearts
You know hearts
You know hearts, you know hearts
You know hearts, you know hearts
Come on, boy
Get in the fire's reflection
You know hearts
