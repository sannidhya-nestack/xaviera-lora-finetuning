Ain't nothing you can say when the dust bowl rises
Ain't nothing you can do but go inside
Now might be a good time
Break out that bible
Have a little moment on the other side
You tell them we're real good men
Just need a little water
Show a little mercy
This land's gone dry
Gotta send in the clouds, oh didn't Jesus
Let your love flow over Kansas skies
You gotta let your love flow over Kansas skies
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
