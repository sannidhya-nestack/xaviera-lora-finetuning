Ain't nothing I can do
There ain't nothing I can say
Ain't nothing left to feel
But whatever's gone your way
Your words were very clear
Not to be second guessed
My best laid loving plans
Now I ain't nothing but a man
Now I can't have a lick of pride
In this ugly situation
Though I'm lucky just to be alive
Still I know I got my own frustrations
It weren't too long ago
Your love you said was pure
That in a breath, in a breath you rolled on me
As you headed for the door
It's a fact that nothing changes
When it comes to us and love
When you're scorned from me you're outrageous
That show them that you're afraid of, oh, oh, oh, nothing
Though now you go and seek a new love
And have yourself a fall
While you're dancing on my empty shelf
You've put the past behind us all
There ain't nothing I can do
Ain't nothing I can't say
Ain't nothing left to feel
So I best be on my way
There ain't nothing I can do
There ain't nothing I can say
No no
