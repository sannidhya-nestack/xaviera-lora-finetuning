Now they will send us out to fight in the name of freedom
For our queen and country, so they will say
But you'll never see the crown with her boots upon the ground
May we find our way out of the storm
And they will require from us proof if we wish to borrow
And they will require from us more in return
But they've never had the gold
It's just a tax against your soul
May we find our way out of the storm
So may we find (may we find)
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find our way out of the storm
United we will stand
But divided we may fall
May we find our way out of the storm
Now Tesla tells us we can power our lives for free
Raw power for the advancement of humanity
But those banksters when they die they wanna be richer than you and I
May we find our way out of the storm
So may we find (may we find)
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find our way out of the storm
United we will stand, but divided we may fall
May we find our way out of the storm
So may we find (may we find)
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find our way out of the storm
United we will stand, but divided we may fall
May we find our way out of the storm
May we find, may we find, find our way out of the storm
United we will stand, divided we may fall
Find our way out of the storm
Now the papers, they will tell us to be fearful
To lock our doors, to stay at home and to be afraid
But I cannot live a lie
I'm not even going to try
May we find our way out of the storm
So may we find (may we find)
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find our way out of the storm
United we will stand
But divided we may fall
May we find
Our way out of the storm
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find (may we find)
Now may we find our way out of the storm
United we will stand
But divided we may fall
May we find our way out of the storm
So may we find, may we find, now may we find, may we find, now may find our way out of the storm
United we will stand, divided we may fall, may we find our way out of the storm
