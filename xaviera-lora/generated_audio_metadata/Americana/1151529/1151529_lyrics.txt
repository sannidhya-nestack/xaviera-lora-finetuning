Running, driving, wondering where do I go tonight
Run to nowhere straight from my heart, no it just ain't right
Still I feel the highway sliding underneath my tires so fast
The blur is mesmerizing
The state line's here at last
Every time I cross that line I et some more
Of the hurt and emptiness since I closed the door
On beauty ever living that I just could not afford
No matter what the circumstance it did not say one word
Just settle up and get my boots, ride and drive and run
Change up the horizon where I knew what I had done
Just take it with you anywhere
I'd like to spin the earth into rivers
Back it out to the days before I loved you crazy
Run it all just one more time
Even that I have my doubts
I'll never get what you're about
What you're about
Two hundred horses ain't whippin' their memories
Some ain't gonna leave no matter where the landscape be
Tryin' out wrong your heart this way you need to travel fast
So fast that words can be unsaid and deeds undone at last
I can't run from nothin'
I just take it with you anywhere
Bottles nearly empty now the tank is sounding hollow
I can't hear it echo every bump
I drink down my last swallow
So many choices are flying through my mind
Of a manhood head to run
Again a thousand times
Run a thousand times
Run a thousand times
Run a thousand times
And never has to run
