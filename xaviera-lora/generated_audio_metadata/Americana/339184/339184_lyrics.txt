Goodbye, Tangerine
You were the best old car I've ever seen
We climbed some hills together, you and me, Tangerine
So let's all head out, upon the open road
It's all behind us now, and we have grown
A sweet machine, sweet tangerine
Goodbye, Tangerine
You were the best old dog there's ever been
We walked some trail together, you and me, Tangerine
So let's all head out for the open air
We'll walk some beaches or trail somewhere
The best there's been at my tangerine
Boy, you were the first woman to take a chance with me
And to be in your arms was sweet ecstasy
Well, I don't know why it ended
I just pretend that you're here with me
My tangerine
Goodbye, tangerine
Well, it's been ten long years since you were seen
The times we had together, you and me, tangerine
So let's all head out, the fully open road
It's all behind us now, and we have grown
A sweet machine, my tangerine
My tangerine
