Friday night, what you do?
Did you sit at home, were you feeling blue?
You didn't go downtown, you didn't stay out late
You weren't running'round
You didn't have a date, no
Did you know that I was there
At the bar, sitting in a chair
I saw you dance with him
And I saw you go home with him
Saturday
You knocked on my door
I wasn't home
I went away
So you called me up on the telephone
I said what's up, said I went back home yeah
Did you know that I was there
At the bar sitting in a chair
I saw you dance with him
Then I saw you go home with him
Yesterday I left that town
Ain't no sense in hanging around
Time has come to move along
I ain't going back for another round no more
Did you know that I was there?
At the bar, sitting in a chair
I saw you dance with him
And I saw you go home with him
