Well I got home the other day
Found a note on the kitchen table
Said it's time to go we've gotta move away
I lost my wife and family
Bottle finally got the best of me
Now I'm all alone and it's plain to see
It keeps telling me a story
It keeps telling me a lie
Keeps telling me she'll come back and be my wife
It makes me feel a whole lot better than the way I really am
When I wake tomorrow morning this bottle is in my hand
I know I'm sinking deeper in sin
The bottle keeps talking it pulls me in
Keeps on telling me you'll be okay
But one step forward and three steps back
Ain't any way to get ahead real fast
But the bottle smiles and says we've got another day
It keeps telling me a story
It keeps telling me a lie
It keeps telling me she'll come back and be my wife
Makes me feel a whole lot better than the way I really am
When I wake tomorrow morning this bottle is in my hand
It keeps telling me a story, it keeps telling me a lie
It keeps telling me she'll come back and be my wife
It makes me feel a whole lot better than the way I really am
When I wake tomorrow morning this bottle is in my hand
