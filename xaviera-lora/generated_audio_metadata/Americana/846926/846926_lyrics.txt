When it's one of those days
When nothing goes right
I always know what to do
Pull down the shades
And turn down the lights
Lie on the couch next to you
When you put your arms around me
A blanket of love surrounds me
Hold me like you won't let go
Hold me, hold me in so close
That I don't know where you end and I begin
Hold me'til I say you win
Without saying a word, you whisper to my heart
And you know what I need to hear
I close my eyes, fall in your arms
And everything wrong disappears
Your hands have a way of reaching me
A warm gentle touch for healing me
Hold me like you won't let go
Hold me
Pull me in so close
That I don't know where you end and I begin
Hold me like you won't let go
Hold me and pull me in so close
That I don't know where you end and I begin
Hold me till I say when
