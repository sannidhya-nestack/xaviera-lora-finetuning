Lonely, I've not been so low
Lonely, I've not been so low
Sleep sometimes I am home
Wake again I'm alone
Why did you go away
Why did you go away
They said I would see this day
Find your God so you can pray
I have seen you here before
Hide behind the door
What are you looking for? (looking for)
Ghosts from the past return
Teach me I can learn
I will watch them burn
Burn
Gunman he does come for me
Gunman he will watch you bleed
You hide but you know he sees
You know you'll never be free
Why does it take so long
Why does it take so long
Come back and sing me a song
Let me tell you I was wrong
I've seen you here before
Hide behind the door
What are you looking for?
Ghosts from the past return
Teach me I can learn
I will watch them burn
I've seen you here before
Hide behind the door
What are you looking for?
Ghosts from the past return
Teach me I can learn
I will watch them burn
Burn
