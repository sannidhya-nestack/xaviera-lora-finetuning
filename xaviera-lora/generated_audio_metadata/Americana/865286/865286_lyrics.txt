And so you leave
You're on the lookout for something greater
And you wanna find more until you say
Well, it's quite enough
But you will see
That getting more isn't always better
And all that glitters looks like gold until you say
Well, that's quite enough
Now take it from me
I look for freedom and some satisfaction
But it's illusion you see
And you can never be free until you say
Well it's quite enough
And so you drink
All the sweet pleasures that fill your spirit
So much it fills you with a flavor so bitter
Then it's quite enough
You say let me be
From all the agony around this world
And sensations blind you in a whirl
Well that's quite enough
Oh take it from me
I tried to fill my cup with golden riches
But it's illusion you see
You can never be rich until you say
Well it's quite enough to be free
Well it's a never ending dance of falling
Yeah, well try and you'll see
That you can never be free until you see
Well it's quite enough
Oh, it's quite a note
Oh, it's quite a note
It's quite a note
Oh, it's quite a note
Hey, well it's quite enough
Oh, it's quite enough
Oh, well it's quite enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
