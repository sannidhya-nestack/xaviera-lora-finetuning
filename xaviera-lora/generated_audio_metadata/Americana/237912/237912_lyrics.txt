Now there's just something about a soldier
That you don't find just every day
Star-spangled, bloodied, and full of virtue
Defending me and protecting you
Now they're just mamas and they're just daddies
Everyday people like you and me
But in their hearts burn an eternal flame friend
For our freedom and our liberty
Oh there's just something about a Marie
You know an airman and a sailor too
Star-spangled, bloodied and full of virtue
Defending me and protecting you
I will always honor those who have fallen
And sacrifice their lives so willingly
That I may voice all of my opinions
It's the reason we're still living free
There's just something about a soldier
That you just can't fight every day
Star-spangled, bloodied, and full of virtue
Defending me and protecting you
No, we can't ive the guard
they work just as hard
They don't get the credit they should receive
From sea to shining sea and throughout each community
I pledge allegiance and I'll always believe
There's just something about a soldier
That you don't find just every day
Star-spangled, blinded and full of virtue
Defending me, protecting you
Star-spangled, bloodied, and full of virtue
Defending me, protecting you
There's just something about a soldier
That you just can't find every day
Star-spangled, blinded, and full of virtue
Defending me and protecting you
