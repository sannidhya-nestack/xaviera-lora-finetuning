Got some shallow minds in the deep south
Pulling the people down
Got hatred spewing from some northern mouths
Pushing each other around
It's the state of mind, not the state where you live
That makes you mistrust another for the color of his skin
Just as the mothers of the young and the dead
Underneath the skin, we all bleed red
Hey it's time we stood up and rang the liberty bell
For a nation divided against itself
From border to border, coast to coast
Compassion for each other's what we need most
Point your finger at the other point of view
And you'll find three more pointing back at you
Hispanic, Oriental, red, black and white
We're all to blame for the great American divide
Got terror on the evening news
A rising body count
Guns and bombs express abuse of the insane underground
The government's fighting fire with fire
Giving them exactly what they desire
And the Eagles fly in a wounded wing
While the lady in the harbor hangs her head in shame
Hey, it's time we stood up and rang the Liberty Bell
For a nation divided against itself
From border to border, coast to coast
Compassion for each other's what we need most
Point your finger at the other point of view
And you'll find three more pointing back at you
Citizen, politician, left or right
We're all a part of the great American divide
With tempers on fire, the angry march
Flags are burned, church is torched
Nothing's sacred, nobody's safe
When your common sense reason gives in to rage
Hey it's time we stood up and rang the liberty bell
For a nation divided against itself
From border to border and coast to coast
Compassion for each others what we need most
Point your finger at the other point of view
And you'll find three more pointing back at you
When ignorance rules and justice hides
We all pay the price for the great American divide
Brother and sister side by side
Together we can heal the great American divide
Brother and sister
Great American divide
Great American divide, oh, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
