March came in like a lion
Who knows when it left
April waits at the station
Eyes all soaking wet
She got her mind made up
She's gonna roll the stone
Melt away like snow on the ground
But there ain't nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
No, there ain't nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
I have no right to reason
I have no right to know
Why April wears a long face
Why April turns so cold
She got her mind made up
Gonna fade away
Look her up on judgement day
There's nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
There ain't nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
Am I spinning my wheels
Are those tears in your eyes
Tell me why you feel so sad
I guess the way you feel you got nowhere to hide
Things can't be that bad
She said money won't buy me the perfect sunset
Or even one drop of rain
But thirty-five, fifty buys a window seat on a down, down Easter train
That's Portland and New York City
Down, down Easter train
Her step-dad had his family
No son to take his name
The old man played his favorites
Said April was to blame
She got her mind made up
She gonna make it alone
Shake the seed right off the throne
But there's nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
No, there ain't nothing left
Nothing left of April's money
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left
Boy, April, you gotta get yourself some cash
I got a nickel, you gotta put a lock on your purse.
