If you have someone other than me
Then I know what this means
But I can take it
And I won't fake it that I'm fine this time
'Cause everybody gets to choose
The ones that they wanna be with
And nobody should have to lose out on what they want
And you made it clear to me
That your man is in me
It ain't like before anymore back when it was fun
If you found your place away from me
Then I know what this means
Yeah I can take it
But I won't fake it like I'm fine this time
Cause everybody gets to choose
The ones that they want to be with
And nobody should have to lose out on what they want
And you made it clear to me
That your man is in me
And it ain't like before anymore back when it was fun
So go ahead and take your love where you choose
And tell me what have I got, what have I got to lose
Yeah go ahead and take your love where you run
Cause it ain't fun, for me no it ain't fun
Cause everybody gets to choose
The ones that they wanna be with
And nobody should have to lose out on what they want
And you made it clear to me
That your man is in me
It ain't like before anymore
Back when it was
Everybody gets to choose
The ones that they wanna be with
And nobody should have to lose out on what they want
And you made it clear to me
That your man is in me
It ain't like before anymore back when it was fun
