I can sense the dark still coming
I can see it in your eyes
Hear the sound of rolling thunder
As you read between the lines
Bitter is the air between us
Temperature from cold to warm
When the midnight rain starts falling
Give me shelter from the storm
I need shelter from the storm
Leaves the chair the way she's talking
So I turn away and hide
Through and through she's disbelieving
No escaping from the lies
And now the lightning strikes above us
I try to say she's missing form
But the anger keeps on coming
And give me shelter from the storm
How can we right the situation?
Is there a way back home from here?
Reaching a logical conclusion
I know it's never easy
Hoping we can make the thunder disappear
Make it disappear
Try to stop the rain from falling
I'm feeling better bruised and torn
But the elements keep coming
I need shelter from the storm
Give me shelter from the storm
I need shelter from the storm
I found shelter from the storm
