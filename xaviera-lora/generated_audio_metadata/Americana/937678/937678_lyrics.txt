Went to see her girls
Under the sweet southern sky
Love was so strong
Was with'em all the time
At the end of the day
She laid down to rest
When the sunrise came
She had already left
To Grudwon, to Heaven's Gate
that's the way that it goes
It's a trip we all take
Is when no one knows
Was a hard living man
Who worked day and night
In the last moment
Knew something wasn't right
But he went on ahead
Bent to the task
Before it was done
Found it was his last
Took Route 1 to Heaven's Gate
that's the way that it goes
It's a trip we all take
It's when no one knows
Wasn't a surprise
He'd been sick for a while
But when he saw his kids
Still made him smile
But some things you can't stop
Just come to an end
He hoped when he arrived
Find himself a friend
To group one to heaven's gate
that's the way that it goes
It's a trip we all take
When no one knows
When no one knows
When no one knows
