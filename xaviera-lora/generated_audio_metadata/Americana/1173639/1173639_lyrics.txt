There was pickup trucks and hot rods
Up and down the road
Angels and banditos
They were hanging around the door
Inside my van was loud and rocking
Out of control
You know I just couldn't keep from thinking it's just like home
I took a break and I went outside
The moon was full but sad
A little girl who scared me
Asked for an autograph
I heard her boyfriend call her name
She began to bare her soul
Hope I said it all just above my name
I wrote just like home
By the time the moon was setting
Some roadies attitudes
Had gone from bad to fried to worse
Blame it on the brew
No blood got shed but a tattooed guy got shoved across the floor
I raised my cue stick above my head and holla just like home
People are where you find'em
Paris, Texas to Paris, France
They all put one leg at a time in whatever they call their pants
The rich may have a heart of stone
Poor have a heart of gold
But if you look too hard you'll see right through it
And it's just like home
People are where you find'em
Paris, Texas to Paris, France
They all still footin' one leg at a time
In whatever they call their pants
The rich may have a heart of stone
Poor may have a heart of gold
But if you look too hard
You see right through it
And it's just like home
Yes it's just like home
I said just like home
