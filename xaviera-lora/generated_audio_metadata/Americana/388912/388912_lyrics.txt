We are one in America
Let's all stand together and pray
We are one in America
Our tears fell for freedom that day
We've found in our sorrow the faith from above
Our flag stands for liberty, for strength and for love
Yes, we are one in America
Let's all stand together and sing
We are free in America
And freedom's a beautiful thing
We've found in our sorrow a faith from above
Our flag stands for liberty, for strength and for love
Yes, we are one in our marriage
Let's all stand together and sing
Yes, we are free in America
And freedom's a beautiful thing
Yes, freedom's a beautiful thing
