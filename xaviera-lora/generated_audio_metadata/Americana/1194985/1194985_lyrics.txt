But all the way to the top I go
I've been sold and I went out to spoil
But all the way to the top I go
Working hard is all I know
They all say it's impossible
And maybe that is so
If I don't go and try
I will never know it's a lie
It all has principles
If we don't hurt we don't grow
Show everyone your light
Fight for what is right
All the way to the top I go
I've been sober, I went out to smoke
But all the way to the top I go
The work being hard is all I know
We all go through things, bro
Just how some things may go
It's okay to cry
Even clouds drop to the ground sometimes
Poking up my window while I'm laying on my pillow
