Well, I know a place that you don't wanna go
Because the folks down there, they're pretty mean
And since you asked the way, oh, the best thing I can say
Or don't go there after dark
Well cousin Henry, he was a gambling man
He got the kind of darkness in his soul
Well, I pray he's safe, but he ain't been seen for days
Well, don't go there after dark
And everybody knows that a cold wind blows all around that town
And there ain't no milk of human kind this here
You might feel a chill
And my words ring in your ears, oh
Don't go there after dark
'Cause it'll be just like you to find yourself on the wrong side of town
As night time falls and darkness creeping in
You don't look so brave from the dirt of a shallow grave
Well, don't go there after dark
I said, don't go there after dark
Well don't go down there
And if you do then say your prayers
Don't go there after dark
