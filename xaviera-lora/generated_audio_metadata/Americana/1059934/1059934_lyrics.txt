What do I do when the rain comes
What do I do when she goes away
What do I do when the wind blows
What do I do when I finally know
What do I do when the morning comes?
What do I do when it's time to go?
What do I do when there's no more reasons?
What do I do when I'm free?
I will know
I will know
What do I do when the paint is dry?
What do I do when the bills are all paid?
What do I do when the bed is made?
What do I do when I'm happy again?
What do I do when the cell phone rings?
What do I do when I catch your eye?
What do I do when there's extra time?
What do I do when you ask my name?
I will know
I will know
I'm settling in, I'm settling in
I'm settling in, settling in
I'm settling in, I'm settling in
I'm settling in, settling in to love you
I will know
I will know
