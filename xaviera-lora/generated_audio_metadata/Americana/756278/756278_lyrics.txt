O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness
America! America! God mend thine every flaw
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty in law
Beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life
America! America! May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness and every gain divine
Beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears
America! America! God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
