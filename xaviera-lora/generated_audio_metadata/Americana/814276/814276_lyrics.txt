I'm a mirror image of my brother Kane
The family blood's running through these veins
But I'm not alone
We've all got our demons
My life's like a one way track
Heading east and I can't go back
Used to think I could
But I stopped believing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, East of Eden
These vagabond sheds and these lonesome blues
And my worn out dreams leaving nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
Gotta turn around and never look back
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, East of Eden
Fallen angels and lost souls
Got no place left to go
So we're living here
East of Eden
I can't run though I've tried
Got to leave this world behind
To a better place
East of Eden
And these vagabond sheds
And these lonesome blues
And my worn out dreams
Leaving nothing to lose
Gotta turn around
And never look back
Ooh, East of Eden
I'm running though I can't find
The peace I need to ease my mind
There is no rest for the weary
When you're lost and alone
Thank you!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh
Fallen angels and lost souls
Got no place left to go
So we're living here
East of Eden
