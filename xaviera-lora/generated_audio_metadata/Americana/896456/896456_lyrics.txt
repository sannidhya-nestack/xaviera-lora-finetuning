When I see your face I can't escape your eyes
When I hear your voice I have no choice but to smile
With only a touch of your hand my heart is sure you're the reason it beats
Oh if this isn't love it's close enough
Fool me once (fool me once)
Fool me twice (fool me twice)
Oh, fool me, hold me all the way to paradise
If cupids are all missed, it didn't miss by much
If this isn't love, it's close enough
When you're in my dreams, I wish I could sleep all the time
When I'm wide awake, you spend all day on my mind
I want you so much that it hurts, I feel so good I can hardly breathe
If this isn't love, it's close enough
Fool me once (fool me once)
Fool me twice (fool me twice)
Oh fool me hold me all the way to paradise
If cupids arrow missed it didn't miss by much
If this isn't love it's close enough
Fool me once (fool me once)
Fool me twice (fool me twice)
Oh, fool me, hold me all the way to paradise
If cupids are all missed, I didn't miss my much
If this isn't love, it's close enough
