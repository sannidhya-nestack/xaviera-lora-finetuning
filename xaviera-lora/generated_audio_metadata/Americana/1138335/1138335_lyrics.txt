You got me shaking, you got me aching
You got me thinking loads, you got me drinking
You got me crying loads, you got me sighing
You got me so I don't know if I'm living or dying
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble again
I got so much trouble, I'm in trouble again
Hey, because of Nostra and the CIA
They've been asking for my number today
Strange people follow me around
I guess I'm gonna have to go to ground
I'm in trouble
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again
Play that harp boy
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, Oh Lord
I keep on running but I can't slow down
I undertake a look to me with a frown
You say to go, your name's on my list
I think I'll make a run for it and get well pissed
I'm in trouble
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again, hit those keys baby
Give me more, more, more
The preacher preaching and he points at me
Said, "You're in trouble, girl, now listen to me"
Come to the Lord and be born again
I thought a minute and I said, "No way, I'm in trouble"
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again
Play your little guitar here now
It's like this you see
You got me shaking
You got me aching
You got me thinking
Lord you got me drinking
You got me crying
Yeah you got me sighing
You got me so I don't know if I'm living or dying I'm in trouble
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again, easy boys
Oh yeah, I'm in trouble
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again, I tell you again, I tell you again
Oh Lord, I'm in trouble
I got trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again
I got so much trouble
I'm in trouble again
