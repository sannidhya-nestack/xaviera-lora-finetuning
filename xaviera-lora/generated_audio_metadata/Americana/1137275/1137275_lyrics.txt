Like hot rider, no you do me wrong
Like hot rider, trail is long
Went down to Lombre, scrambled on and on
You bought a dream and you broke up my happy home
Black Colorado, trail is long
Black Colorado, going right on
Way out in the desert, way out in the sand
There ain't no bushes and you're passing our holy land
Like how the ride of a train is long
Like how the ride of
Goin' around
Goin' around
Goin' around
Goin' around
Goin' around
Goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' around
Go on now, go on now, go on now, hey, go on now, go on now, go on now
(Humming)
When the highwayman steal all he can steal
Take everything but you've already made a deal
Your right feels the right ground, no you can't pretend
No soldier, no capitalist gonna win back his soul again
Like how the rider trails long
Like how the rider won't ride on
Gone
Gonna ride, gonna ride, gonna ride, gonna ride, gonna, gonna, gonna ride, ride, ride
