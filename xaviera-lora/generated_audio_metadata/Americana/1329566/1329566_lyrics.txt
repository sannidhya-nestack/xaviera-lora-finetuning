In the black swamp water where the blues were born
Lived a rich slave trader called Elijah Thorne
Hell has no fury like a woman's scorn
But no woman held a grudge like Elijah Thorne
Elijah took a shine to a delta queen
Who everyone knew by the name Serene
He offered her a fortune to share his bed
But this was all she said
Include me out
Include me out
If trying to about my love is what you're about
Now you may own every acre of this muddy land
You may own every woman and man
But my love is not for sale
Include me out
Include me out
Well Elijah didn't like her answer, no
He figured Serene was holding out for more
So he offered her more diamonds and gold
But when Serene said her answer still was no
He threatened to take her down to Devil's Bay
And let the alligators have their way
She said tie me down and burn me up in flames
My answer's still the same
Include me out
Include me out
If trying to buy my love is what you're about
You may own every acre of this muddy land
You may own every woman and man
But my love is not for sale
Include me out
Oh, include me out
Include me out, no, no, no
Include me out, oh, include me out
Include me out
