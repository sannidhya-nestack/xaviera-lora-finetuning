If you need me
You know where to find me, yes you do
If you need a hug
Won't you come and get you one or two, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh maybe three

Don't let the distance stop you baby
From getting what you need

Said all I got is love
Said all I got is love, yeah
Said all I got is love to give
See, I don't plan to give you no heartache
And I don't want you to give me no heartbreak, nah
See, I don't plan to give you no heartache
And I don't want you to give me no heartbreaks, nah
