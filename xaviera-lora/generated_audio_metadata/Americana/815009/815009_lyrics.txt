High on Hangman Hill there's a tree that's dry and withered by the sun
Though it's dead it still stands strong like its shadow that is home
The folks that own that land have tried to pull that old tree down
But the roots run too damn deep like its story
It won't let go
A hundred years ago three men died they hung from that tree
The branches held them tall and proud for all the town to see
Three Indian men with innocent blood only guilty for their pride
Their women cursed that tree and like its spirits
It'll never die
High on Hangman Hill
When the night falls it brings a chill
Sometimes you can hear up still
When the wind blows the widows cry
High on Hangman Hill
Hey!
I don't hang my hair
When the night falls it brings a cheer
Sometimes you can hear I'm still
When the wind blows the widows cry
High on Anglin Hill
(audience cheering)
The folks that own that land have tried to pull that old tree down
But the roots run too damn deep like a story that won't let go
Thank you so very much
