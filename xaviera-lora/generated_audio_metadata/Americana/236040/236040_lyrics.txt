I was standing in a chapel on the fourth of July
Beside the dearest couple I've ever seen
And after we had pledged allegiance
The preacher said keep standing
If you served your country here or overseas
From the corner of my eye I saw that old man start to sit down
Then his wife reached out and took him by the hand
She reminded him again that he had fought in the Pacific
Then she held him close and said these words to him
What you can't remember I won't et
You are my hero
I'm in your debt
You fought for my freedom
Defied every threat
But you can't remember
I won't et
As he stood there taking in the applause
I thought about so many who've been lost to the cause
You see them in the streets still trying to find their way home
They survived the war but the war claimed their soul
It's our duty as Americans
To rise and let them know
We will remember
What they can't et
They are our heroes
We're in their debt
They fought for our freedom
Defied every threat
We will remember
What they can't et
They fought for our freedom
Defied every threat
We will remember
We won't et
