Spread your wings, let the bird go free
If you let the bird go free and it comes back to me
It's gonna come back, come back for keeps
Fly so high that you can touch the sky
Fly away to see the things you wanna see
So you can be the man you wanna be
And when you get done running wild and flying high and sailing on the sea
You're gonna come back, come back to me
Run away, run away like a renegade
Like a feather in a hurricane
Like a river racing for the sea
Run away, run away like a renegade
Run fast and free but come back someday
You're gonna come back, come back to me
When you get done running wild and flying high and sailing on the sea
You're gonna come back, come back to me
When you get done running wild, flying high, sailing on the sea
You're gonna come back, come back to me
Come back, run a little faster, chasing happy ever after
Come back, run a little faster please
Come back to me
Come back to fly a little higher, chasing all your heart's desires
Come back to fly a little higher please
Come back to me
Come back, run a little faster, chasing happy ever after
Come back, run a little faster please
Come back to me
Come back, fly a little higher
Chasing all those silver linings
Come back, fly a little higher please
Come back to me
Spread your wings
Let the bird go free
If I let the bird go free
Then it comes back to me
It's gonna come back
Come back for peace
It's gonna come back
Come back to me
It's gonna come back
Come back to me
When you get done running wild, and flying high, and sailing on the sea
You're gonna come back, come back to me
When you get done running wild, and flying high, and sailing on the sea
You're gonna come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
You gonna come back, come back to me
You gonna come back, come back to me
You gonna come back, come back to me
You wanna come back, come back to me (come back to me)
You wanna come back, come back to me
