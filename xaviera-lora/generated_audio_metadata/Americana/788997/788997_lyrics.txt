She wears a red ribbon'round her arbor hair
Any guy who wants her better beware
She don't bug it loud, you know she rocks
She ain't Mary's little lamb, no, she's a fox
Her time ain't something for you to waste
She has her own expensive taste
She's caviar, not bagels and lox
She ain't a pussycat, she's a fox
Deep down inside there's a scared little girl
Deep in the ocean there's a precious pearl
Deep down inside she don't really know
Who she is or where she's gonna go
She comes off like fire on ice
She teases you with a tiny slice
She's not some little girl in Barbie socks
She's a woman of the world
She's a fox
She's a fox
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's a fox
Deep down inside there's a lonely little girl
Trying to make her way in a grown up world
Deep down inside she's not really sure
Anyone will love her just for her
So you better show her a lot of respect
And treat her right or she'll defect
She's worth more than all the gold inside Fort Knox
She's not an imitation for no, she's a fox
If you're smart you'll marry her, she's a fox
She's a fox, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a fox, she's a fox
