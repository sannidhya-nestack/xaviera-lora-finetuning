Waiting on the dark rolling over me
For the hour I become free
Rolling over me
I'm waiting on the groove taking my feet
Waiting for the heart aware of my speed
Rolling over me
I'm waiting on the time to stop
Dragging the tears
Wasting my time
Time wasn't real
But it's rolling all over me
I'm waiting on the blues musking through
Waiting on my fortune, waiting on you
Rolling over me
I'm just waiting, but I know
It ain't never gonna be
I'm waiting on me
Waiting on the spring, spring in the light
Waiting out the sunshine, waiting for the light
Oh whatever will be, will be
I'm just waiting
But I know I'm only waiting on me
I'm waiting on me
I'm waiting on the blues bursting through
Waiting on my fortune
Waiting on you
I won't ever will be, will be
I'm just waiting
I don't know
I'm only waiting on me
I'm waiting on me
I'm waiting on me
I'm waiting on me
Waiting
We didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't
