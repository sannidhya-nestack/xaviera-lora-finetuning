Out behind the juke joint
I passed out on the break
I did not care to work this room
This gave one big mistake
I hear the wildest talking on and on
Raving about who's here
They tell me all about their Jezebels
Their laughing and their tears
Out behind the Duke Joy
Well, we let an angel pass now
We pass along the skin
Nobody ever told this man
He's playing it way too stiff
An hour of playing some Harry Potter
A twenty minute break
Sitting between these old parked cars
Life is sounding great
I'll be hiding in Duke Joy
An hour's worth of music
A break in a conversation
The many times I've played this show
With lots more fascination
Fascination
I'll be hiding in Duke Joy
Sittin' out behind the juke joint, ooh
(Behind the juke joint)
Sittin' out behind the juke joint
(Behind the juke joint)
Ooh (Behind the juke joint)
Lots more fascination
