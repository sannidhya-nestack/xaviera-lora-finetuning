I see you've been running off the road
Come in and make it out on your own
It's only me that you want to hold
Your foolish pride will take your soul
The land is raked and it's already gone
The manic days and you know what it cost
They're taking everything that you hold
Your brain is weighed down where to go
Oh, you know you're not crazy
Failing times doesn't make it so
Not alone, you're not crazy
But you're spinning round in a field
You're not crazy
Though you feel that you're wandering down
The lines are shading your fragile mind
You can't explain what you want to find
You know you're right when they say you're wrong
Their useless pride will keep them gone
Oh, you know you're not crazy
Though you think that you might be spiraling down
You know you're not crazy
Despite what they'll say
You know you're not crazy
You're a world who is spinning'round nowhere
Oh you know you're not crazy
Though you think that you're gone
You know you're not crazy
You're not crazy, oh you know you're not
You're not crazy, you're not crazy, you're oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, you're not crazy, you're oh, you know, you're not crazy
