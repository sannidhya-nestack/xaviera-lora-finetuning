Oh yeah, uh-huh
Hey, hey, want ad?
I need a little help here
It been five long years
I went help a scalp there
Show me some mercy
Try to show me a sign
Every time I see her ad
I fuckin' cry
She ran out like a cat
Looking for a new prey
Now I gotta look at her damn picture every day
I got me half a mind to answer her plea
To try to get that girl in love before she knows it's me
Hey, hey, won't ask like old buddy says
I'm a solid blue and I need a helping hand
Try to ease my mind
Try to show me a sign
She was a deluxe model of love and that's bona fide
Chop chop chop
I got me half a mind to answer her please
She is advertising for anyone but me
Hey, hey, want it? Oh, can't you see?
I ain't the fool I used to be
I'm gonna tell you just a little bit about what I would like to see in my WANAD
I love kayaking, snowboarding, and four-wheel riding, and walking by the beach on a bed of roses
I warm up quickly in small groups, especially groups of like three
I'm a solid blue
I'm a thinkin' ahead
And I need a helping hand, hey, hey, one hand
Just one more time, yeah
Before I get the one I'm so mad for
Show me a little mercy, try to show me a sign
Every time I see her eyes, I fall to cry
Show me some mercy, show me a sign
Every time I see her ass, I'm bound to cry
Every time I see her ass, I fall to cry
I said every time I see her ass, I fall to cry
