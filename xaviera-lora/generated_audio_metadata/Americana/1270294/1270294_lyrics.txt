I look out on an American landscape
And see the past that you can't escape
Built on blood and toil
On eternal wars and turmoil
You cannot escape
From this American landscape you cannot escape
From this American landscape
I see the stars in stripes draped on graves
Over the souls of the once brave
Who fought for freedom and for slaves
And for all those downtrodden
Now otten in these times called modern
In the land of the free
You introduced slavery
And took the black man's liberty
For a life of misery
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
People kill for the color of their skin
From then'til now, bell of hate rings
In your land, the rule of the gun
Affects the lives of everyone
You kill presidents and men of peace
The fighting and killing doesn't cease
For wars of brothers against brothers
There will always be another
You cannot escape
From this American landscape you cannot escape
From this American landscape
There is a little house built on land
Now occupied by the white man
On the plains Buffalo once roamed
That was once the Indians' home
But that was such a long time ago
This land, it is their land
This land isn't your land
It belongs to the Indians
And out to the white man
You cannot escape
This land belongs to them
From this American landscape
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
You stole it over generations
And you put them on reservations
From Osakiye to Elona
And from Rosebuck to Yakoma
The First Nation evicted and suppressed
And ridiculed and oppressed
Erased from the history books
Rewritten by politicians and crooks
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
You cannot escape
From this American landscape
The past is gone and the future goes on
You can make good what's wrong
You are a nation that is strong
Your obligations you can't escape
You must fix this American landscape
