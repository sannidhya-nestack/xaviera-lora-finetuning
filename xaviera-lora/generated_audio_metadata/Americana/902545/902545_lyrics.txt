Take me to the sunrise
High on a mountain
I wanna see in your eyes
The first red sun
Oh, take me to an ocean
And bathe me in the water
A wave of emotion
Is it slipping over me?
Take me to the places
Where the rivers flow
Where the ball frocks sing their song
All night long
I wanna see the moon shine
How it lights your face with a beautiful silver glow
I wish there was a river to take me home
I wish there was a river to take me home
A beautiful river (a beautiful river) to carry me home
A winding river (a winding river) leading me home
Take me home (beautiful river)
Show me the way back home
Beautiful river
Take me to the sunrise
High on a mountain
I wanna be home where the red river flows
Take me to the border
Where I can see your future
Standing on a corner
Where I'm waiting on you
I look up to the heavens
And I feel the peace
And I hear the water flow
I wish there was a river
To take me home
I wish there was a river
To take me home
A beautiful river
To carry me home
A winding river
Leading me home
Home, back home
I wish there was a river to take me home (I wish there was a river)
I wish there was a river (a river) to take me home (I wish there was a river)
A beautiful river (a beautiful river) to carry me home (to carry me home)
A winding river (a winding river) leading me home
