Yesterday took me as a soldier
With an uncertain glance from tomorrow's shoulder
Someday some golden way we'll meet again
I fought and died there on that ridge
I sacrificed and we took that bridge
There wasn't time to say goodbye, remember
There wasn't time to reason why, December
When you see the colors fly, remember me
I think of home and it's a sunny day
Before the clouds of war took me away
I'm every soldier that you see
Who sacrificed to make our nation free
Yesterday took me as a soldier
With an uncertain glance
From tomorrow's shoulder
There wasn't time to reason why
Remember, there wasn't time to say goodbye
So when you see the colors fly, remember me
When you see the colors fly, remember
Me
