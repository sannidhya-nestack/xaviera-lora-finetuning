Well, I work hard each and every day
And you can damn sure bet that I earn my pay
Oh everything I make
It's better than Japan
Well just check my card
I'm a union man
I am a union man
And I work, yes I work with my hands
Oh don't talk to me about the minimum wage
Because I want fair pay and I'm proud to say
Oh I am the union man
Well those dirty crooks up in DC
They took our good jobs and sent them overseas
Oh their day will come
And they'll understand
When they have to face
A Union Man
Oh I am a Union Man
And I work, yes I work with my hands
Well don't talk to me about the minimum wage
Because I want the fair pay and I'm proud to say
Well I am a union man
Well it's time that we set the record straight
We helped to make this country great
Well I am a union man
Oh yes I am a union man
