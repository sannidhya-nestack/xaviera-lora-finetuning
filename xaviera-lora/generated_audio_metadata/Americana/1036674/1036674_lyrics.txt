The washing machine's overflowing, the kids have the flu
You've got a house full of headaches
A miracle's overdue
But even when you have impossible days
I know I'll come home to a smile on your face
Some people see darkness, doom and despair
Instead of the beauty that's found everywhere
They choose to live in a place where cold winds blow
While they only see the thorns, you see the rose
You see the rose
Friends tell their troubles to you whenever they call
They're scared of climbing lost mountains, afraid they might fall
But your inspiration takes away all their fears
You chase away the clouds and make the sunshine appear
Some people see darkness and doom and despair
Instead of the beauty that's found everywhere
They choose to live in a place where cold winds blow
While they only see the thorns, you see the rose
You paint a wonderful world for me
I see colors like I never knew
Now everything looks so much brighter from your point of view
Some people seek darkness, doom and despair
Instead of the beauty that's found everywhere
They choose to live in a place where cold winds blow
While they only see the thorns
You see the rose
You see the rose
You see the rose
You see the rose
