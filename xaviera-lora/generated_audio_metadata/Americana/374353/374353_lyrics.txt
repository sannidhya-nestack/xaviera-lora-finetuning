The sun rises in the morning
Just like a billion times before
Well, can you feel the pain now that it rains?
So now you're thinking it's all over
You do what you say, say what you mean
And life's not just a party
Yet sometime you've got to wake up too
Just what you believe in
My brother beats me with a stick
Each day things go bad
Every day you step closer toward your fate
A heart that's beaten
A butcher, a banker, a six-gun lying there
As the old man rides alone into the distance
It's not so bad, no it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Don't walk away
Don't even look away
You might rather slip away
But then things would get ugly
