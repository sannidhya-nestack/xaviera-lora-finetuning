I've heard some pretty strange excuses
But none quite as lame as this
I've seen lovers try some mean abuses
But not one of yours involved a kiss
Why has your sweet love gone flying?
Way like a page in the breeze
Seems it ain't no use in my trying
To find any help upon my knees
Don't you ever lose your spirit
The one that began with a beat
You'd never choose to hear it
Or show a little tenderness to me
While you're solving me out on your shelf
Say, stalling is good for your health
I've got to suck it up now
To find out how
This strange plague will shake itself out
I dare not try and wait for a newer sound by day
Or could there ever be anyone else
That knows me just as well as you stand
I've been right on the edge of the well
Now love just can't seem to prevail
Why you starving me out on your shelf
You say stalling is good for your health
While you're starving to me out on the ocean
Say Stalin is the food for your head
So have a nice life my ex ex wife
In a heartbeat you'll find someone else
