I had no home, I was poor
So I went and broke the law
But I couldn't win
Now I'm on this road gap
Paying for all my sins
I blew the bank in a one horse town
When they tried to stop me I shot a man down
Road gangs, not on the train gang
Yeah, I'm with road gangs
I'm on that chain gang
I'm breaking rocks in the noon day heat
It's ninety five and I'm dead on my feet
My back is sore, my hands are raw
Zombies down, burns my skin
So I don't know what world I'm in
He's been broke and not on a chain gang
Yeah, I've been broke, gang
I'm on my chain, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Broke, gang
Now I'm on my chain, gang
Yeah, I've been broke, gang
I'm on the chain gang
The sweat dries up, the salt on my lips
Just God hates me and gives me the whip
There ain't no women and there ain't no booze
Workin' so hard, I got nothin' to lose
There's dirt in my lungs and grit in my eye
Gonna be slavin' here until the day that I die
He's been broke gang
Now I'm on the chain gang
Yeah, I'm broke and I don't like changing
There's dirt in my lungs, I got grit in my eye
Gonna be sleeping here until the day I die
I'm a shackled man
On the chained up gang
I'm on the road gang
On the chained up gang
He said road gang
Not on the chain gang
Yeah, I'm road gang
I'm a chain gang
Gangs! Gangs! Gangs! Gangs! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gangs! Gangs! Gangs! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
These big rogue gangs
Not a chain gang
Yeah, I've been broke and I don't like changing
Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang!
