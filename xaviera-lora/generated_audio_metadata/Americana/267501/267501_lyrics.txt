When the weather turned warm enough to wander
And the Carolina moon shone full in the spring
When the boys delighted I knew he was back
By that sweet scratching sound of his fiddle strings
Some nights I'd sneak and follow him
To the old barn dance where he'd play and sing
And the horse hair rubbing on the catkin
Made my bare feet shuffle and my little heart sing
They said he was shipless and lazy
Trading his life for a fiddle's ring
Most said he was just crazy
But to me
He was a fiddle king
He drank whiskey whenever he could in an old hollow log he'd lay up for days
But he was never too drunk to remember any tune I asked him to play
He played devil in the straw stack, jack of diamonds and Bonaparte's retreat
He'd whip his bow into a G ia shuffle
Made his eyes shine bright and gave'em dancing feet
Mama said she'd snatch me bald if she ever caught me putting bow to strings
She said the fiddle was the devil's toy but it sounded like heaven
In the hands of the king
They say he'd run from the army
That the old home guard would soon make him swing
He said it wasn't his war he wouldn't fight no more
He was going down to G ia after the spring
The last time I ever heard him play
The guard had him backed up to a cottonwood tree
His last request was Bonaparte's retreat
I've always thought he played that tune just for me
Some said he was no countin' lazy
Tradin' his life for a fiddle's ring
Most said he was plain crazy
But to me, oh, mama said he died a sinner
Wasted his life on the devil's play thing
Well that may be so, but somehow I know that right now
He's in the hands of the King
Fiddle King
