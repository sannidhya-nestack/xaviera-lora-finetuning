Ricky's job dried up at the mill
Like so many jobs these days
Still living that high paying life
Without the means or the ways
What's a tree anyways?
An easy night's work
A thousand dollars an easy buck
A load of blocks and a pickup truck
But to hear those big cedars fall
It sends a shiver down my spine
For eight hundred years they stood right here
And now there's only sawdust left behind
Black market bill, you ran the cedar mill
Turning out those shakes and shingles for the public's buying will
These are desperate times, a man's gotta live
Motivated by the greed of an easy dollar bill
But to hear those big seniors fall
It sends a shiver down my spine
For eight hundred years they stood right here
And now there's only sawdust left behind
Left behind
It burns a hole in the hearts of honest men
To see those big trees wasted and never come again
Let's not pretend
It's bound to happen again
Midnight roads and B-train loads
The blocks still pour out
The dirty cash in those dirty pockets feels pretty good, no doubt
But desperate men aren't new to us, but this is desperate news
Finding new ways to offend us, new ways to abuse
But to hear those big cedars fall
It sends a shiver down my spine
For eight hundred years that they stood right here
And now there's only sawdust left behind
Left behind, left behind, left behind
