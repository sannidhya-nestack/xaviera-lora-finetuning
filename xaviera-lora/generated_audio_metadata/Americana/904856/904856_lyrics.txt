Paris, silence, South Carolina
Joining up with the Corps
Not gonna be a bar full
Spinning a bar stool
Waking up on the floor
You find out who you are
When everything goes hoo-bah
When a man makes plans
God sits back and laughs
Cover me, I'm going in
Tell my next of kin
So cover me, I'm going in
Karma ain't kicking in
So cover me, I'm going in
Sitting on the sideline, buying my time
Watching the world go crazy
Friends wonder why I don't pick a side
Who wants to push up daisies?
But now I've had enough
The time has finally come
Time to disappear
Leave out of here
Cover me, I'm going in
Tell my next of kin
To cover me
I'm going in
Karma ain't kicking in
So cover me
I'm going in
With two feet in my boots
I can steer any way I choose
When life's on the line
I'll be risking mine
Cover me, I'm going in
Do what I gotta do
Cover me, I'm going in
Give'em all a wood shampoo
Cover me, I'm going in
Whether I lose or win
Cover me, I'm going in
Just like going for dead
Cover me, I'm going in
