I got so used to this evening's cry
et that I can't lie
Still I try to change them facts of such conditions
Said spells ain't easily broken
No matter what the hell's the token
Heartaches are gone on my breaking old traditions
Since you left me frozen cold
Sure ain't slowed my growing old
Pain and heartache travel side by side
Some special circumstances fuel the ends of my romances
Since the only thing that's left to do is cry
While I try to et that not so recent past
Being stuck here only deepens my position
One more drink another mile sure will be the last
Getting over you'd now be changing my position
E-de-de-le-me-de-de-le-do
Oh tell me now sweet darling
What prize has caught your eye
No wax poet again hand me no more lines
Will you ever own it up
You love me more than twice
Don't break your standing trend
The soul on ice
I don't need your kind and vacant treason
Don't need to dig my heart to freedom
I don't need no more crying songs, that's for damn sure
I can't make no propositions to help but feel my intuitions
Let'em go right now, be breaking them old traditions
Getting over you'd be breaking old traditions
Getting over you'd be breaking old traditions
