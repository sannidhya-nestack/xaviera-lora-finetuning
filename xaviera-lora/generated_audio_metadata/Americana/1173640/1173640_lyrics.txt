What's your fantasy, pretty girl or handsome guy
They might fool you, lead you to a dreary life
One, two, three, now fantasize, hold a dream till it comes true
It's a fact of life, a dream belongs to you
Life gets better if you fantasize (fantasize)
Life gets better if you fantasize
Know your destiny, remember where you've been
Know your enemy, he might be your next best friend
One, two, three, now fantasize, hold a dream'til it comes true
It's just a fact of life, a dream belongs to you
Life gets better if you fantasize (fantasize)
Life gets better if you fantasize
Here's a fantasy
Chillin' won't be taught to hate
Their little generation
Could be the last if we're too late
One, two, three, now fantasize
Hold a dream'til it comes true
It's just a fact of life
A dream belongs to you
Life gets better if you fantasize (fantasize)
Life gets better if you fantasize
(Fantasize)
Life gets better if you fantasize
(Fantasize)
Life gets better if you fantasize
(Fantasy, fantasy)
