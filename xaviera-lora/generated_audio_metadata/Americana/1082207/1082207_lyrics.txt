Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!
Small town blue-eyed girl
She used to march with the band
Her daddy worked for the state
Her mama clapped her hands
Just look around this broke-down town
There must be someone here
You need us to face your fears
As God is her witness and mama still draws breath
The aim is never leaving strong stem
All the church friends say
It's time to be a wife
Listen to what we say
Submission is the life
Just look around this broke up town
There must be someone here
You need us to face your fears
As gone is her weakness and mama still draws breath
Name is never leaving strong still
She's 38 now, still works at the diner
Lives beside her folks, waiting for love to find her
Mama always said, be happy where you are
If you do this my child, you won't have to go too far
She's got us her witness and mama still draws breath
Aim is never leaving a strong stand
There's gonna be some weirdness in my self-just breath
Aim is never leaving a strong stand
