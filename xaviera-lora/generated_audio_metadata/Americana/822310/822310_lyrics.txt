My ma was drinking on the kitchen floor
The sun was knocking on her grandpa's door
Come on in the water it's fine
Y'all gonna have a good old time
Yeah, we got beer cooling in the tub
There's plenty more in my old beer cup
Someone's gonna get overdone
But that's okay, you're all having fun, yeah yeah
Gonna furl down the music clouds
Gonna kick up a storm and I'm out of dust clouds
Gonna tuck out the bag with cheery V
Laissez-les vom' tom roulette
Laissez-les vom' tom roulette
Laissez-les vom' tom roulette
Let the good times roll
Yeah, we've invited the local po-po
And they're gonna dance to the side echo
There ain't no neighbors gonna kick our hide
they're all gonna have a good old time, yeah
Some old boys just turned up late
The banjo's picking from the fourth wheel gate
Daddy's fellas are joining in
My guitar has found some friends, yeah
We're gonna party in the full moonlight
Got people comin' round to dance all night
Gonna cook up a mess of a buffet
Let's do le bombe d'en roulette
Let's do le bombe d'en roulette
Let's do le bombe d'en roulette
Let the good times roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gonna throw down all the music lines
Gonna kick up the storm out of my dust clouds
Gonna duck out the back with Gene Lee Day
Les Ulibamtonrullet
Les Ulibamtonrullet
Les Ulibamtonrullet
Let the good times roll
I said let the good times roll
Let the good times roll (let the good times roll)
Let the good times roll (let the good times roll)
