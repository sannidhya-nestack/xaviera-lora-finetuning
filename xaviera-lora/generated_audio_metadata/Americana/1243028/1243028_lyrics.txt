As a child I often played soldier games
We'd fight all day everything was just pretend
Lines were drawn in backyard dirt
No one was afraid or got hurt
At the end of the day we were still best friends
When I grew up I went to war
Soldiers games were pretend no more
I fought for my country to protect
With my brothers and sisters I stood tall
Knowing that some of us might fall
And I served the Corps with honor and respect
The price of freedom we had to pay with lives and sacrifice
A cost for some continues today
Respect is all we ask for the price of freedom
We are someone's son and someone's daughter
Brother, sister, mother or father
We proudly served in foreign lands
Far from the loved ones in our home
Far from the comforts that we've known
All we ask is that you understand
The price of freedom we had
To pay with lives and sacrifice
A cause for some continues today
Respect is all we ask for the price of freedom
The price of freedom we had to pay with lives and sacrifice
A cause for some continues today
Respect is all we ask for the price of freedom
Respect is all we ask for the price of freedom
