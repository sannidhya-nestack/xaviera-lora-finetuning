Every day in the hot city sun
I work real hard and I get the job done
But every night in my dreams I go
Down the Mississippi to the Louisiana Bayou
With a sack on my back and a thumb in the air
My friends say I'm crazy but I don't care
Cajun rhythm burning hot as a fool
Creole crazy losing a battle
So many people having too much fun
Hey pretty baby say you gonna come
New Orleans, Baton Rouge
Gotta be getting there soon
Dancing on the Zydeco moon
I'm gonna jump and sing, I'm gonna play my part
Smack dab in the middle of a Mardi Gras
Grab a little piece of the mystery
Children of the slaves and the Akaiji
So many people having too much fun
Hey pretty baby say you're gonna come
New Orleans, the Baton Rouge
Gotta be getting there soon
Dancing under that azure moon
Yeah
Oh yeah
Dancing, dancing by the cold moon
It don't matter if the fish don't bite
I'll stay all day'til it turns to night
Alligator eyes in the heat of the swamp
Backwater shack, we all gonna stomp, say
So many people having too much fun
Hey, pretty baby, say you're gonna come
New Orleans or Baton Rouge
Gotta be getting there soon
Dancing under that cold moon
That cold moon
Dancing on the zydeco moon
Dancing, dancing, zydeco moon
