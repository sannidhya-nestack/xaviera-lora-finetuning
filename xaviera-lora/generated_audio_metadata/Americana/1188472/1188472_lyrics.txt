It was a raggedy, rumbly'66 Cadillac
Mama in the front, daddy driving us kids in back
Me riding on the floor
Looking at the stars through the window
Those stars, they look so close
Those stars, they look so bright
Just your average Creole family
Flying down the road in the middle of the night
Heading back to Plaquemines Parish
Black'em up, black'em up, black'em up, black-'em up, black'em up, black'em up, black'em up, black'-'em up, black'-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black'-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black -'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up, black-'em up
As a child I believed hurricane season was a good thing
Pack our things and leave to visit kinfolk in the city
But my favorite part of all the journeys we went on
Was laying on the floor with that raggedy rumbly'66 Cadillac heading straight for home
Black up, black up, black'em up, black'em, black up, black'em up
Black up, black up, black'em up
Black up, black up, black'em up
Black or mine?
