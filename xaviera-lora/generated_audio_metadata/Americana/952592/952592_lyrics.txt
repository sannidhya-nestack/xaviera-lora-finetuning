Oh Lord, can you hear me?
One hour to go now they're gonna kill me
Oh Lord
Can you hear me?
One hour to go now they're gonna kill me
Twenty years ago
They locked that prison door
Now they're gonna execute me
Put on another random
Oh Lord
Can you hear me?
Thirty minutes to go now they're gonna kill me
Oh lord
Can you hear me?
Thirty minutes to go now they're gonna kill me
Is it up to you
What you gonna do
Will you save me from the man with the needle in his hand
Oh Lord, can you hear me?
My time is up now, they're gonna kill me
Oh Lord, can you hear me?
My time is up now, they're gonna kill me
Will you take my hand
Take me to the land
Make everything alright
You know I didn't do it right
You know I didn't do it right
You know I didn't do it
You know I didn't do it
