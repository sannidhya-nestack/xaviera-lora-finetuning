We keep coming back,'cause there's no place like
The song of the uplands keeps me alive
My sentence in the city is down to five
Then see if you can find me
I swallowed beers
I swallowed tears
Worried years away
That shady stream
My hazy dream
Still so far away
The shadows of the clouds color the mountain tops
I'm happy to be where I'm alone
I was raised further north in a mining town
But I had to go forth to start living my songs
I've swallowed beers, I've swallowed tears
Counting years away
That shady stream, my hazy dream
Someday I will stay
Found a kind woman like the song you see
She's my favorite part about being me
We share the laughs and we dream the dream
She's rocking on the porch and I'm picking up steam
I'm swallowed beers, swallowed tears, worried years away
That shady stream, my hazy dream, someday I will stay
I've swallowed beers, swallowed tears
Counting years away
That shady stream, my hazy dream
One day I will stay
