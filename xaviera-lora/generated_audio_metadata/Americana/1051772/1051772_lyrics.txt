I know that things are hard but I'll do all I can
I see better times for this humble man
So won't you dance with me'neath the starry night
We'll waltz away our troubles'til the morning light
Hold on, hold on when you're weary of a world that doesn't care
'Cause I know who you are
There's nothing in this world that can compare
Just reach out your hand and I swear
I'll meet you there
I know that you're afraid but you won't be
'Cause you changed everything for this rolling stone
And with this fire inside we'll make it through somehow
Leave the tears behind'cause you have two hearts now
Hold on, hold on
You're weary of a world that doesn't care
I know
You are, but there's nothing in this world that can compare
Just reach out your hand and I swear
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
All I ask is you believe in me
I believe in you and all that you can be
And when the wind blows cold, you can lean on me
I know that things are hard but I'll do all I can
I see better times for this humble man
So won't you dance with me'neath the starry night
We'll waltz away our troubles'til the morning light
Hold on, hold out when you're weary of a world that doesn't care
'Cause I know who you are
But there's nothing in this world that can compare
Hold on, hold on
Clearly I'm a world that doesn't care
I know who you are
But there's nothing in this world that can compare
Just reach out your hand and I swear
I'll meet you there
