High on Hangman Hill there's a tree that's dry and withered by the sun
Though it's dead it still stands strong like a shadow that is hung
The folks that own that land have tried to pull that old tree down
But the roots run too damn deep like it's story
It won't let go
A hundred years ago three men died they hung from that tree
The branches held them tall and proud for all the town to see
Three Indian men with innocent blood only guilty for their pride
Their women cursed that tree and like their spirit
It'll never die
High on Hangman Hill
When the night falls it brings a chill
Sometimes you can hear I'm still
When the wind blows the widows cry
High on Hainman Hill
High on Hangman Hill
When the night falls it brings a chill
Sometimes you can hear'em still
When the wind blows the widows cry
High on Hangman Hill
Hey
The folks that own that land have tried to pull that old tree down
But the roots run too damn deep like it's story
It won't let go
