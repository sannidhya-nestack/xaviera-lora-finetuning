Hey, darling, walk away with me
I've got a pocket full of money, there are sights to see
I've been working all week and I finally got paid
Down in the valley near the greenwood shade
I know a place where we could dance till late
They all know my name and the music's great
The people come running from the neighborhood
I'd stay all week if only could
Hey, darling, walk away with me
I've got a pocket full of money, there are sights to see
You're the cutest girl that I ever did see
Sweeter than the honey from the bumblebee
I'd surely be delighted with your company
So come on over, spend some time with me
Hey darling, walk a while with me
I've got a pocket full of money, there are sights to see
I've been working all week and I finally got paid
Down in the valley near the greenwood shade
We got the moon and the stars above
Heads full of hope and hearts full of love
It takes a little time to make love last
So we don't need to move too fast
Hey darling, walk a while with me
I got a pocket full of money, there are sights to see
I've been working all week and I finally got paid
Down in the valley near the greenwood shade
Down in the valley near the greenwood shade
