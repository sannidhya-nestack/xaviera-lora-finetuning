Leaves are blowing on the asphalt tonight
Rumble strips wake me up
I pass another loaded logging truck
The radio sings along
It's a long and winding road
Another hour and I'll be home
To do it all again is gonna take a better man
Than I am
Cause every night there's headlights in my dreams
Wiper blades are passing back and forth over me
Well I see tail lights in the dark
And I smell gasoline and sparks
Dish lines filled with old beer cans and trash
Another tourist, another boat
There's one more broken down compact car
Fifteen years past the prime
It's a long winding road
Another hour and I'll be home
To do it all again is gonna take a better man than I am
every night there's headlights in my dreams
Wiper blades are passing back and forth over me
Well I see tail lights in the dark
And I smell gasoline and sparks
Fifteen years past my prime
What a waste of time
You drive like hell to save five minutes
You take those turns way too fast
The early morning fog and the black ice
Will this trip be your last?
the long winding road
Another hour and I'll be home
To do it all again is gonna take a better man than I am
Cause every night there's headlights in my dreams
Wiper blades are passing back and forth over me
Well I see tail lights in the dark
And I smell gasoline and sparks
Well I see tail lights in the dark
And I smell gasoline and sparks
