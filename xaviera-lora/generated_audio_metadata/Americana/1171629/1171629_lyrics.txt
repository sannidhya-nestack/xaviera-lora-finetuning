Delia, pray for me while I'm off fighting in the war
Oh Delia, remember me if I should fall and be no more
As we march along our way
The trees above us stand and pray
The cannon roar, the bugles blare
The smoking haze conceals old death's stare
Delia, pray for me
While I'm off fighting in the war
Oh, Delia, remember me
If I should fall and be no more
The battle cry rattles the bones
We're stepping in the sun alone
Our wounds congeal, the blood grows cold
We lie in peace, our story told
Our last day together
Was warm and bright
We fell together in the heather
The fragrance of your hair
Filled the night, oh Delia
Dream of me
You know how much I love you
Oh, dear, you remember me
If I should die and fade away
If I should die and fade away
