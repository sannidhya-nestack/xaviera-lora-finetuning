Tired of taking the path of least resistance
Thought good things would come with a little persistence
Never played the lottery, no scratch-offs for me
You make me wanna try something new
Think I'm gonna take a chance on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
When we met there was a bit of hesitation
But you and your guitar prove too much temptation
No more playing solitaire, we're the perfect pair
You make me wanna try to spin that wheel
Gonna take a chance on something real
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
Don't be afraid to roll that dice
The stakes might be high
But don't think twice,'cause I've got an ace up my sleeve
The jackpot is ours if we believe
Maybe we'll go down in history
Come on honey, take a chance on me
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting on you
I'm betting, betting on you
I'm betting on you
