I would sail the seven seas to find a bird of paradise
Just like the one that haunted all my dreams, beautiful bird of paradise
I'd spy the pirate sleeping off his gin
Who had a bird of paradise
I crept on over and I stole from him
That bird of paradise
Sing me love songs my bird of paradise
Spread your wings and fly
Sweet bird of paradise
Well she can dance and she can sing
Just like a bird of paradise
I gave her gold and silver and diamond rings
she's my bird of paradise
Sing me a love song, my bird of paradise
Spread your wings and fly
Ah, ooh, ooh
My bird don't whistle, now my bird don't sing
Everybody knows
You can't catch a bird of paradise
Gotta let her fly on home
My bird don't whistle, my bird don't sing
Everybody knows
You can't catch a bird in paradise
Gotta let her fly on home
Gotta let her fly on home
Gotta let her fly on home
