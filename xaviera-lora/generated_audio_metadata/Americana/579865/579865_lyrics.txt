When you hit the beach at Kuwait
Prepare to abandon all you once held to be true
Old friends and lovers to remember one thing
Be glad you're alive
Someday I'm coming home to you
And though I'm feeling older
Feet upon my shoulder
The world has turned one more time around
With jet engines screaming
No time to find a meaning
My fire friends
Where we go bound
Yeah, yeah
Where we go bound
Soon we'll come hurling out of the blue
Dropping our bombs on the ground
But something I must do if we can make it and come back alive
That's all that matters for now
And oh, I'm feeling older
Fade upon my shoulder
The world has turned one more time around
With jet engines screaming
No time to find a meaning
My fine friends
Where we gone by
Yeah, yeah, where we go bound
With jet engines screamin'
No time to find a meanin'
My fire friends
We're ego bound
Yeah yeah
We go back
Yeah yeah
We go back
