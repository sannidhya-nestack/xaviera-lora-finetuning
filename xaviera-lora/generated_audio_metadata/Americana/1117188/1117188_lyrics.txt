Passed a girl who knew her place
On this earth was through and through
Cupid left her broken shaft
Charmed her snakes and left her flat
Now she launches little arrows with her quadraphonic stereo
All of her friends are down in them grooves
She burns the money that she makes all the time she has to wait
Does she know it's getting late when she's got a leap to make
Yeah she launches little L's with her quadraphonic stereo
All of her friends are down in them grooves
She launches little arrows with her quadraphonic stereo
All of her friends are down in them grooves
But when she dreams she spins round and round
When she wakes she's left all alone
She shivers down a road so cold
It's not pretty when we're getting old
Does not hear the popping hiss
It brings her to the thing she missed
Heartaches left her feeling sick
Who will stop and light this wick?
Now she launches little arrows with her quadraphonic stereo
All over France, a denim named Groove
She launches little arrows with her quadraphonic stereo
All of her friends are denim name grooves
