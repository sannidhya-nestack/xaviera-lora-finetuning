Johnny Simpleton loved to play
Up the street with the friends he made
And the magic he'd find
Instilled in his mind to this day
Johnny gave up a life for fun
Sent away now to fire his guns
But he knows what it means
He won't let his dreams slip away
It's a miracle
It's America
And for freedom we stand
Home in the land of the brave
Now he's off to meet desperate times
Gone to liberate desert lands
And the story that's told
Must now be the role Johnny plays
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
And for freedom we stand
With faith in the land that we stay
It's a miracle, mission possible
And for freedom we rise, the world can't rely on a friend
He grows tired of the siren and launchers
He grows tired of the sound of the pain
He grows tired of the enemy marches
But he hasn't grown tired
Of his dreams inside
In the light of a battle's done
From a fighting a war is won
And the story that's told must now be the role that we play
Nothing frightens me more than war
it might lead to more and more
And the pain we feel now must not be allowed to remain
It's a miracle
It's a miracle
And for freedom we stand
Home in the land of the brave
It's a miracle
Mission possible
Yeah, for freedom or rise
The world can't rely on a friend
Yeah, it's a miracle
It's a miracle
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
