If I don't see you sooner, I'll see you later
My heartbeat is blipping like a percolator
you are hotter than a radiator
If I don't see you sooner, I'll see you later
She's a hot, hot
I should have learned to dance, then I'd get that girl
Who made the rules in this crazy world
Molly Mercedes, Don Perignon
Arouse a lot of interest and very little love
If I don't see you soon, I'll see you later
My heartbeat is blipping like a percolator
'Cause you are hotter than a radiator
If I don't see you soon I'll see you later
She's a hot, hot
Now this little girl is so darn sweet
I'd crawl a million miles just to lick her feet
Even do the backstroke round the whole wide world
And just for one date with that pretty little girl
If I don't see you soon I'll see you later
My heartbeat is blipping like a percolator
Cause you are hotter than a radiator
If I don't see you soon I'll see you later
So I started at the school of Rogers and I stare
I'm floating on my feet like clouds in the air
You are the girl that makes my life complete
Doonah you be mating dancing dancing cheek to cheek
If I don't see you soon I'll see you later
My heartbeat is flipping like a percolator
'Cause you are hotter than a radiator
If I don't see you soon I'll see you later (she's hot, hot)
Oh come on honey
Oh yeah, we're gonna get to it sooner or later
Oh you're hot
So darn hot, come on baby
