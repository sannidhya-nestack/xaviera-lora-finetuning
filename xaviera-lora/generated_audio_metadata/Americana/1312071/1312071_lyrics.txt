My next door neighbor'd be out workin' in her yard
She'd bring out a pitcher and two jelly jars
Poured out her heart as she poured the sweet tea
Then she'd smile and share her postcards with me, she said
The first one I ever sent was to my mama
I wrote I'm having fun at grandma and grandpa's postcard
Can take you back in time
Recapturing sweet moments of your life
Snapshots of where you've been
Can take you there again
Silent movies that still tug at my heart
My life is in this box of postcards
Here's one showing cherry blossoms in Washington, D .C.
Next is Atlantic City, the taffy sure was sweet
Yellow stones, old faithful, here's the Coney Island pier
And every one of them signed, "Love, you wish you were here"
Here's the first one my daughter sent to her mama
She wrote, "I'm having fun at grandma and grandpa's"
Postcards can take you back in time
Recapturing sweet moments of your life
Snapshots of where you've been
Can take you there again
Silent movies still tug at my heart
My life is in this box of postcards
Sweet used to be's that still tug at my heart
My life is in this box of postcards
