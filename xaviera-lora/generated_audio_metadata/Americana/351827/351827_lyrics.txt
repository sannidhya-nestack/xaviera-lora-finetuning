The minute I stop looking up
She seems to always get stuck on those petty, petty details
What I expect to happen
A mile optimistic manner
Mixed with her inner voice panter
Always leaves me hanging by a broken branch
What do I do? What do I do?
Leaving me with no answer
It all comes down to a drop when we speak from our hearts
We were watching an American movie
About a true American romance
If I had anything to do with it
I would've wrapped it up
Wrapped it up in the first hour and a half
What do I do? What do I do?
Leaving me with these answers
But it all comes down together
And no one gets hurt
What do you think about that?
Your shoulder open and my hand on your lap
What do I do, what do I do
They're leaving me with such small answers
It all comes down to love when no one gets hurt
Guide me for the break of day
And if I'm still awake
You're more than welcome to say what would I do without you
Now give me just a little bit of credit
For some of that sweet young puppy love
You are saying what I'm thinking of
A cameo in your window
And the one that's around your neck
Just like that
Just like that
I'm the same person I was when we met
Oh, just like that
What should I do?
What should I do?
Believe in me with these answers
It all comes down to something we know
Guide me for a break of day
Guide me for a break of day
And if we're still awake
You're more than welcome to stay if you want to
I'm just like that, just like that
Guide me for the break of day
And if we're still awake
I'll be more than welcome to say
What would I do without you?
