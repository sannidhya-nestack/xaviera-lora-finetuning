Hey sweet Molly where'd you go last night
Hey sweet Molly you don't hold me tight
You don't call me on the phone
You don't ring my bell
You've been seen at the Dairy Queen
With a boy from Louisville
Hey hey sweet Molly your kisses are cold
Hey sweet Molly, you're out of control
My friends keep telling me that we should be through
But Molly, I'm still in love with you
Hey Sweet Molly, I found somebody new
Hey Sweet Molly, she kinda looks like you
She always calls me on the phone
She keeps ringing my bell
But I've been told by some friends I know
She likes a boy from Louisville
Hey Hey Sweet Molly, he's gonna make you cry
Hey, sweet Molly, let's give it one more try
I'm not the perfect man, I know
But one thing is true
Molly, I'm so in love
Molly, I'm so in love
Sweet Molly, I'm so in love with you
