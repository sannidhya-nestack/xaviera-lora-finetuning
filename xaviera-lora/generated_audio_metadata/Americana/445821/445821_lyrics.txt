I work all week trying to save a dollar just to spend my life renting room for two
At night I go and get a bottle and I dream of air making love with you
Love with you can be a problem when the sun coming up means we gotta go home
All we do is dig a deeper hole to bury our hearts before the feeling's through
Bury our hearts before the feeling's through, yeah
That's what she says as she's walking out the door
She's getting locked up in pop pop hell
She's getting locked up in pop pop hell
She's getting locked up in pop pop hell
It's the mating call
A family life's not for everyone
And everyone knows that it's not for you
But when we wake up from our wanderlust
Guess what a family life is through
Love with you can be a problem
When the sun coming out means they gotta go home
All we do is dig a deeper hole
Or bury our hearts before the feeling's through
Bury our hearts before the feeling's through
Hey, hey, hey
And this is what I sing as I'm walking out the door
Julia bop bop bop bop for hell
Julia bop bop bop bop for hell
Julia bop bop bop bop for hell
Yeah, it's the mating call
You know, you're gonna play around, you gotta pay for it
And she's went out the door again
Well, I'm gonna work, I'm gonna work
I'm gonna work, work, work, work, work
Work all week trying to save a dollar just to spend my life renting rooms for two
At night I go and get a bottle and I do my veil making love with you
Love with you can be a problem when the sun coming up means we gotta go home
All we do is dig a deeper hole to bury our hearts before the feelings through
Bury our hearts before the feelings through
Bury our hearts before the feelings through
