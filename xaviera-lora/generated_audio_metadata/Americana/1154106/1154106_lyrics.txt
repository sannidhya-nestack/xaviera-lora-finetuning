Don't know anything about oppression
Or anything about this disease
I've never been to the Mississippi Delta
I've not been down to New Orleans
But I don't know how I lost my freedom
I don't know how you lost yours
But someday maybe we'll be together
I'm hoping that we'll finally see
That the only way that we can have freedom
For all of us to be free
I don't know much about persecution
I mostly lived a life of ease
I've never had my ankles shackled
Nor feared the color of my seed
But I don't know how I lost my freedom
I don't know how you lost yours
But someday maybe we'll be together
I'm hoping that we'll finally see
That the only way that we can have freedom
Is for all of us to be free
I wasn't there and you weren't there
But somehow we still feel the chains
Maybe next year is the year that we all will be free
I've never been to Alabama
To see the way that people live there
Never thought skin could be a reason
For treating people wrong this long
But I don't know how I lost my freedom
I don't know how you lost yours
But someday maybe we'll be together
I'm hoping that we'll finally see
That the only way that we can have freedom
Is for all of us to be free
But the only way that we can have freedom
Is for all of us to be free
Is for all of us to be free
