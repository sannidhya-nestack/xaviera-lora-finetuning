And she turned her back and walked away from me
I turned away like I could care
Fourteen months and my ecstasy
Disappears into thin air
It's not like me baby to want you back
I've left a trail of destruction
Broken hearts in packs
But it's different now
Oh my dear
Redemption day is here
I always spent my raises on you
All the filler at the station could buy
A pretty pink dress and dime-store perfume
In all of this you know I tried
But a lion's heart is what it takes to be true
And how I was so destructive
I'd drive the morning dew
But it's different now
Oh my dear
Redemption day is here
And you won't see me hanging around these empty streets
After you're gone
I'll blaze out of here to some lonesome song after you, after you're gone
Redemption day and you must pay
She calling all those markers in
Collection day you'll be waiting
Packed up and on the curb again
But Amy I will never et you
But never you and I
Nor this lonesome town I grew
It's different now
Oh my dear
Redemption day is here
