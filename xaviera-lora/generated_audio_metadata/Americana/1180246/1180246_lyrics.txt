Wrong place, wrong time
I need to get away
This don't feel right
I search for better days
Wrong place, wrong time
I gotta shake these blues
Hurting inside
I need to get out soon
No more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again, no more
I don't wanna feel this pain, no more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again, no more
I don't wanna feel this pain
Wrong place, wrong time
The situation's bad
Leaving tonight
These feelings cannot last
Wrong place, wrong time
This pain I can't endure
On the down slide
I gotta find a cure
No more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again
No more
I don't wanna feel this pain no more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again no more
I don't wanna feel this pain
Wrong place, wrong time
I need to get away
This don't feel right
I search for better days
Wrong place, wrong time
I gotta shake these blues
Hurting inside
I need to get out soon
No more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again, no more
I don't wanna feel this pain, no more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again, no more
I don't wanna feel this pain, no more
Don't wanna go through this hurt again (no more)
I don't wanna feel this pain (no more)
Don't wanna go through this hurt again (no more)
I don't wanna feel this pain
