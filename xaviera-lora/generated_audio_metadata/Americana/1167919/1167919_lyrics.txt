He found her in an old country yard
A classic two-tone'53
All beat up, broken down, a discard
But in the wink of his rearview mirror
A poor man's fantasy
Now she's a good ten foot paint job
Rolling down the road all the bondo never showed
Real good ten foot paint job
A beauty in her day
Still looks fine from far away
All his friends thought that he must be blind
All they saw in the relic was the rust
But year after year he paid no mind
he knew when he was finished she'd leave them in the dust
Now she's a good ten-foot paint job
Rolling down the road all the Bondo never showed
Real good ten-foot paint job
A beauty in her day
Still looks fine from far away
Well, she'll never win best of show
The numbers don't match, don't you know?
And the body's not quite straight
But she's running on all eight
And when he's cruising down the boulevard
He knows she's looking great
(Whistling)
He found her.
In an old country yard
The classic two-tone'53
All beat up, broken down, driven hard
But in the wink of his rearview mirror
He saw what she could be
Rolling down the road
All the bondo never showed
Real good ten foot paint job
A beauty in her day
Still looks fine from far away
