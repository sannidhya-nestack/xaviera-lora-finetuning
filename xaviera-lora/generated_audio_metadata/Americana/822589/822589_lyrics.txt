Look out for the hard ones
Trail worn and dust dry too
In town for the last time
And looking for the likes of you
Look homeward, old cowboy
Last round us been said and done
One last glass of whiskey
And you'll be homeward bound
Women like roses blooming
At the last chance saloon
They set your head to spinning
Leaving you howling at the moon
Look homeward, old cowboy
Last round up's been said and done
One last glass of whiskey
And you'll be homeward bound
Your horse is tired and so are you
You know you have to go
Riding off into the sunset
On the last trail
Taking it slow
Look homeward, old cowboy
Last round up's been said and done
One last glass of whiskey
And you'll be homeward bound
Look homeward, old cowboy
Last round up's been said and done
One last glass of whiskey
And you'll be homeward bound
