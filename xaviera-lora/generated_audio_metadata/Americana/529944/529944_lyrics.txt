Lately, I love these lazy days and all I ever want to do
Is go down to the riverside with a blanket and a fishing line
And spend a little time with you
We'll go waiting in a brook that's gently rolling
As it slowly makes its way down through
A pond where frogs are jumping, dragonflies are zumping
To spend a little time with you
I'm gonna tell my troubles goodbye and say
I ain't got no time for you
And ease them along on their merry way
I'm sure they can find something better to do
And maybe we'll watch the river flow
And then we'll skip a stone or two
Leave behind our worries
Ain't no need to hurry
When I spend a little time with you
I'm gonna tell my troubles goodbye and say
I ain't got no time for you
Ease them along on their merry way
I'm sure they can find something better to do lately
I love these lazy days and all I ever want to do
Is go down to the riverside with a blanket and a fishing line
And spend a little time with you
And maybe we'll watch the river flow
And then we'll skip a stone or two
Leave behind all worries, ain't no need to hurry
When I spend a little time with you
Oh leave behind all worries, ain't no need to hurry
When I spend a little time with you
