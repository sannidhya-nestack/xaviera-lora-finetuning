Life builds character, experience builds wisdom
Words he shared as he drank his rum
He said that's a motto to live by
There's no use in wondering why
Don't try to change things you can't control
Nature cures a blood-stained soul
And he had seen his share of sorrow
We can be here today and gone tomorrow
That's a cowboy's wisdom
Rain will come and wash away his pain
Since his wife's been gone
He's not been the same
So lonesome he prayed to God out loud
He saw a small opening in a cloud
At that moment he felt her there
He knew God had heard his prayer
The rain made him feel alive
he could feel her love inside
Thankful for his cowboy wisdom
He rode the plains and the mountainside
Living off the land gave him a sense of pride
He prayed that when it was his turn to die
He'd be riding the trail and that night he'd lie
Underneath the tree with a nearby stream
Close to the earth that's a cowboy dream
He holds on to that cowboy wisdom
Working hard is a cowboy's life
It was easier when he had a wife
She kept him warm on those cold, cold nights
Until then there wasn't much comfort inside
He thanked the Lord as he bowed his head
And that night when he went to bed
He counted stars but one was extra bright
His faith in God was his guiding light
That is a cowboy's wisdom
He rode the plains and the mountainside
Living off the land gave him a sense of pride
He prayed that when it was his turn to die
He'd be riding the trail and that night he'd lie
Underneath a tree with a nearby stream
Close to the earth that's a cowboy dream
He holds on to that cowboy wisdom
And as he closed his eyes that night
In a gentle rain his soul took flight
Guided by that cowboy wisdom
Guided by that cowboy wisdom
