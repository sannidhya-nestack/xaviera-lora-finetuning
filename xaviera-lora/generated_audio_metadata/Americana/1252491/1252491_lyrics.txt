She was a girl of righteous upbringing
Taught always right from wrong
Discombined with an elegant feature
Made her beautiful, tall and headstrong
She was always in the company of suitors
Though in time none of them would stay
it's not easy being beautiful
And so easy to give it away
She said, "If love, it is the answer"
And honey, I don't know a name
And if love, it is forever
I have only my good self to blame, la la
She leaves behind her a trail of broken hearts
And she says she is always to blame
For every time she thought she'd met someone
The outcome is always the same
See, the independence that makes us all in capturing
Stems from an anger deep down inside
And when her father left her alone in the darkness
The trust inside of her died
She said, "Of love, it is the answer"
Then honey I don't know her name
And if love, it is forever
I have only my good self to blame
She said new love, it is the answer
Then honey I don't know her name
And if love, it is forever
I have only my good self to blame
Ah la la
So many times I have asked her to marry me
And the answer is always the same
With her eyes and her beauty before me
She says she has no one to give her away
No one to give her away
She said of love it is the answer
Then honey, I don't know a name
And if love, it is forever
I have only my good self to blame
She said if love, it is the answer
Then honey, I don't know a name
And if love, it is forever
I have only my good self to blame
Only my good self to blame
