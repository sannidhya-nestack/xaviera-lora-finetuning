Down on Granada Drive lived a girl named Lisa
Planned to be an astronaut at ten years old
Once held a magic show in her daddy's study
She'd ride her bike with us boys she was creative and bold
Across the aisle from me sat a teenage Lisa
She raised her hand for every question in class
But she found that Joey Hughes wouldn't give her a minute
Unless she kept her ideas to herself
She changed so fast
And I wish that I could tell her then
What I could say now, whoa-ho
Run like the time when you were wild
Dance like the days when you were a child
Good little girls don't always have to smile
Go back to the years when you were wild
At the desk beside of me sat a woman, Lisa
She did what she was told and never spoke her mind
When they promoted me to the office in Phoenix
Well the company left Lisa far behind
And I wish that I could tell her then
What I could say now, whoa-ho
Run like the time when you were wild
Dance like the days when you were a child
Good little girls don't always have to smile
Go back to the years when you were wild
She used to think that she could do anything
If she just tried hard enough (hard enough)
Until she realized that getting it done
Makes a woman seem to grow
Run like time when you were wild
Dance like the days when you were a child
Good little girls don't always have to smile
Go back to the years
Run like time when you were wild
Dance like the days when you were a child
Good little girls don't always have to smile
Go back to the years when you were wild
When you were wild
When you were wild
