We moved out here and we settled down
You put me in your car, you drove me into town
Hey there, Janie, stop acting crazy
We got a new place now, it's gonna be alright
We got a new place now, we got a new place now
I got a new place now, it's gonna be alright
I got a friend named Chester, he's kinda hard of hearing
People talking to him but he just ain't listening
Hey there mama, I gotta go outside
Don't make me wait, don't hurt my pride
We got a new place now
We got a new place now
We got a new place now, it's gonna be alright
Take me swimming with the women
Gonna run around, gonna have a ball
Trusty light, shining bright
You can let me run off into the night
We got a new place now
We got a new place now
Got a new place now it's gonna be alright
It's cold down here
And it's warm up there
Put me in your bed and it'll be alright
If you're going shooting, I can stay at home
If you're going shooting, you can leave me alone
We got a new place now, we got a new place now
We got a new place now, it's gonna be alright, alright
