There's people talking smack about the USA
That we're the great Satan, well I'm here to say
We feed the hungry, we clothe the poor
We saved the free world in the second world war
We ain't afraid to die to end an evil regime
There's a natural disaster, we're the first on the scene
But if you threaten our people, threaten our friends
They'll be pulling our boots out of your rear end
Don't mess with the U .S. Don't mess with the U .S .A.
Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines
A military like the world's never seen
It's peace, liberty and justice for all
Oh we're ready to fight, we're ready to brawl
Don't mess with the U .S .A
We're a peace loving people, we defend what's right
We gotta push real hard to make us fight
But if you cross that line, you'll soon see
You shouldn't have messed with the land of the free
The evil is watching, so you can't hide if you stand for freedom
Then you're on our side, you're either with us or not
Peace is our goal, we're ready to rock, we're ready to roll
Don't mess with the U .S. Don't mess with the U .S .A.
Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines
A military like the world's never seen
It's peace, liberty and justice for all
Oh we're ready to fight, we're ready to brawl
Don't mess with the U .S .A
Don't mess with the U .S.
Don't mess with the U .S .A.
Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines
A military like the world's never seen
It's peace, liberty and justice for all
Oh we're ready to fight, we're ready to brawl
Don't mess with the U .S .A
Don't mess with the USA
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
