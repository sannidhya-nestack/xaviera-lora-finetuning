Two shots of whiskey making me feel loose
Two pills of happy say goodbye to the blues
Big bills in my pocket making me feel rich
People I want to get away from
I can get in the slip
But all these feelings
They don't mean much
Compared to you, baby
They all turn to dust
I've felt every pleasure
But it all comes back to you
There ain't no drugs
Like your love, like your love
Silk suits in my closet, making me feel chic
A lifetime of attention, making me unique
A million friends in my network
Protecting me from harm
They all tell me I'm right
Even when I'm wrong
But all these things
They don't matter much
If you're not around
And I can't feel your touch
I've searched the world
But it all comes back to you
There ain't no bus like your love
There ain't no drug like your love
Like your love
Three shots of whiskey, making me feel all loose
Three pills of happy
Wave bye bye to the blues
But all these feelings
They don't mean much
Compared to you baby
They all turn to dust
I've felt every pleasure
But it all comes back to you
There ain't no buzz
Like your love, there ain't no drug
Like your love, like your love
Like your love
