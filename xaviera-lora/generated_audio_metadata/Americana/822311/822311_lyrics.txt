Muddy Mississippi, take me home
To the place my love waits alone
Twenty-three hundred miles long
Muddy big river, take me home
Back in'61 I left my home
On the mighty river the Natchez roamed
I left my darling standing there
A pretty white rose was in her hair
These bloody four years that I have known
Brave men I've seen come and go
Now as I lay here the soldier unknown
I want Big River to take me home
Well the night she's wrong
You gotta take me home
To my pretty white rose
Carry me home
Won't you carry me home
Muddy Mississippi, take me home
To the place my love waits alone
Twenty three hundred miles long
Muddy big river, take me home
To my pretty white rose
Muddy Mississippi, take me home
To the place my love awaits home
Twenty three hundred miles long
Muddy big river, take me home
Mighty big river take me home
Mighty big river
Mighty big river take me home
To my pretty white rose
