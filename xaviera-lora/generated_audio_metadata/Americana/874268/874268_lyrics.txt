A weathervane brought wind and rain
A New York City hurricane
So glad you came my weatherman
You won the broken hearts and broken window panes
Don't hide under your umbrella
Just keep your raincoat on
And prepare for stormy weather
Just keep your hot pack on your sleeve
Don't you cry no more for me Irene
Don't you cry no more for me Irene
Oh yeah before you shut the door
I felt the rain a little more
Your sister said they held my hand
And then she left me in the rain
Another hurricane
Don't hide under your umbrella
Just keep your raincoat on
Ain't prepared for stormy weather
Just keep your heart on your sleeve
And don't you cry no more for me Irene
Don't you cry no more for me Irene
Don't cry, the hurricane is over
It's been raining head since the 13th of October
Don't you wash me away
Black rain drops on the newspaper page
So don't cry, don't you cry
Don't you cry no more for me
Don't you cry no more for me Irene
Don't you cry no more for me Irene
This is the story of the third
This is the chorus and the verse
This is the story of the past
This is the story of the last
Last time in the raid
I stood out in the rain
I stood out in the rain, last time in the rain
This is the story of the first
This is the chorus and the verse
This is the story of the past
This is the story of the last
Last time in the rain, I stood out in the rain
Ooh, ooh, ooh
