Adele, my Creole belle
Now when I was young, you taught me well
And when I was lost, you found my trail
Adele, you're my Creole belle
Now Josephine, my virgin queen
Straight from the pages of a magazine
And all the other school boys were so green
Josephine, my virgin queen
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
Now Annalie keeps me company
Annalie you're the one for me
And you broke these chains and set me free
Annalie keeps me company
Adele, my Creole belle
Now when I was sick you made me well
And when I was lost you filled my cell
Adele you're my Creole belle
