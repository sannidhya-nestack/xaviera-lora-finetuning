I wake up feeling restless every day
Cause I don't know where I'm going
Along the way
I've been following my heart up come what may
But I don't know where I'm going
Along the way
Along the way
Along the way
My guardian angel caught my fall
But never once tried to spare me from it all
She said I could see you were heading the wrong way
But I knew I couldn't stop you along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Along the way, along the way
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Along the way, along the way
Along the way
On the fortune teller in my hand he said son you will make it to your promised land
But you will walk through hell many a day
Cause you won't know where you're going
Along the way
Along the way
So goodbye my friend, we'll meet again someday
And I will be pulling for you
Oh, along the way
Along the way
Along the way
Da da da da da da da da da
Along the way
All along the way
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da
Yeah
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na
Along the way
Da-da-da-da-da -da-da-da-da
All along the way
Along the way, along the way
