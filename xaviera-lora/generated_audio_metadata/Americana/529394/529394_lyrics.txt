Do you know her?
Where did she come from?
What's her story?
They all have one
What about him?
A string of bad luck
Or nowhere to turn when hard times struck
An old rucksack from Vietnam
Holds all he owns
That old cart she's pushing
She calls her home
Living under bridges
Sleeping anywhere at night
Homeless, invisible, out of sight
Think about how each soul is bare
If we were to stop and stare into their eyes
Looking in from two sides of life
Would they see guilt, hate and blame?
Would we see fear, despair and shame?
We can't make them invisible
By turning our back and closing our eyes
Was he a hero
Fighting for our lives
Was she a mother
A loving wife
Why was no one there
To turn them around?
When their world turned upside down
Let's worry less about why they gave up and when
Than we do about who gave up on them
Leaving'em under bridges
Sleeping anywhere at night
Homeless, invisible, out of sight
Think about how each soul is bare
If we were to stop and stare
Into their eyes, looking in from
Two sides of life
Would they see guilt, hate and blame?
Would we see fear, despair and shame?
And how many of us could really understand?
To think about how each soul is bared
If we were to stop and stare into their eyes
Looking in from two sides of life
Would they see guilt, hate and blame?
Would we see fear, despair and shame?
Let's not make this
I am invisible
By turning our back and closing our eyes
No they're not invisible
It's time to turn back and open our eyes
