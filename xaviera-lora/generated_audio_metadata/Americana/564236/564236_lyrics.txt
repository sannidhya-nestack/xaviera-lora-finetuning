A cold front is coming and the wind howls on
Soon the rain will thunder on the roof
The essence of cigar drifts in the open window
The smoking man upstairs remains aloof
There's a lawn being mown
And leaves are being blown
The notion of a muffler is ignored
The siren chases business at the dingy nursing home
The children at the pool scream in discord
The sounds of the city rally in my brain
I try to rise above the constant noise
Not much I can do
To stop the ringing in my ears
Grit my teeth and maintain my poise
It's just the soul of the city
A radio blasts out above the local marching band
The harlequin is rumbling to the beach
A diesel engine roars as they empty garbage cans
I can hear men on TV trying to preach
The sounds of the city rattle in my brain
I try to rise above the constant noise
Not much I can do
To stop the ringing in my ears
Grit my teeth and
Maintain my poise
It's just the soul of the city
Now at three in the morning
The wind has quieted down
The radio no longer makes a sound
I can hear you breathing
Sleeping softly next to me
You make me feel there's no one else around
Despite the song of the city
The sounds of the city
Rattle in my brain
I raise myself above the constant noise
Not much I can do
To stop the ringing in my ears
With you here I can maintain my poise
It's just the soul of the city
It's just the soul of the city
It's just the soul of the city
