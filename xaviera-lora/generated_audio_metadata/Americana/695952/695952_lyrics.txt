Am I losing you? If it seems I've gone too far
It doesn't mean I've gone astray
It might seem so crude when my eyes won't come unglued
From the internet to you
Just like an artichoke
My life, it has many petals
Mostly they're hard to chew
But tender inside the middle
You know I found the answer
You know I found the reason
And now I know just what it was that I was always seeking
On our favorite sand
Leaving footprints holding hands
Almost like a new romance
In the gardens too
All that growth surrounding you
Into I am just like our arms
Just like an artichoke
My heart, it has many petals
Mostly they're hard to chew
But tender inside the middle
You know I found the answer
You know I found the reasons
And now I know just what it was that I
Was always seeking
You know I found the answer
You know I found the reasons
Now I know just what it was that I was always missing
It was you
It was you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
