Everything good is on the highway
Take what you can from today
Everything good is on the highway
Letters that you wrote me
The politics of motion
Goodbye screaming disappearing day
Everything good is on the highway
Take what you can for today
Everything good is on the highway
Come on, come on
Yeah
Everything good is on the highway
Take what you can from today
Everything good is on the highway
Where the road ends I call you
But the saddened lights of longing
Are heard less and less
The further we move away
Everything good is on the highway
Take what you can from today
Everything good is on the highway
Everything good is on the highway
Everything good is on the highway
