I woke up this morning around a quarter to ten
Remembering I'm supposed to go to work again
Your daddy's old lady couldn't lay me no jive
Make me happy just to wake up, wake up alive
On that highway doing my work in private, eighty-five
Not paying much mind to the will to survive
Not singing your particular song in my head
Just dreaming about rolling back in your warm bed
I might could've been giving, could've walked out dead
Wouldn't have had to listen to what your daddy said
Might could've been paying your bills instead
I'm gonna celebrate one more life
One more life in debt
Oh yeah, guess I owe your daddy one debt
I'm gonna testify now
I've been around a long time, I got no regrets
Death I never could get you off of that track bed
And what trouble I'm missing, your money's all gone
Guess I'll find myself another way to carry on
If you like driving me to work so much
You can do it yourself, I'll let you pop the clutch
Maybe one day you'll quit
Advice to make you happy just to wake up
Wake up alive
I seen your daddy been poking around and round
Asking this one and that one up on my end of town
He done figured who's doing your stuff
He's beating you to the punch
I think he's beating you to the punch
Oh yeah, beating you to the punch
Oh yeah
Come on Dennis
I might could've been different could've wore my best
Wouldn't have had to listen to what your daddy said
Might could've been paying your bills instead
I'm gonna celebrate one more life
One more life in death
Oh niggas I owe your daddy one day
