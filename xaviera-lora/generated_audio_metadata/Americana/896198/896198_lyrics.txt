I see my face in the mirror getting ready for a brand new day
I got so much on my mind I grab breakfast and I'm on the way
I can't find my purse, I can't find my coat, never leave my bedroom clean
Sometimes I wonder where the road is taking me
When it all goes good, we'll all be together
But times get tough, you're gonna remember
I never have to look too very far to see
All the faces of my friends smiling back at me
When I'm just a girl who's trying hard to get it right
I have to admit I've made mistakes in my life
I don't have to call my friends
Cause they're never too far away
Oh, they make me feel good when I need a little saving grace
When it all goes good, we'll all be together
When times get tough, I'm gonna remember
I never had to look too very far to see
All the faces of my friends smiling back at me
If you were down, if you were out
You know I'd come to your rescue
Living life is what life's about
And you can't do that without a friend or two
Talking'bout you
I'm waiting for tomorrow all across the neighborhood
With the people I got, the future's looking mighty good
But my days grow short and I hear the call, I know what I'm gonna see
The faces of my friends smiling back at me
When it all goes good, we'll all be together
But if times get tough, I'm gonna remember
I never have to look too very far to see
The faces of my friends smiling back at me
