Sometimes it's hard to say goodbye
But it's the best thing we can do
I never wanna make you cry
Cause there's something deep between me and you
The curtains closing on my stay here
And I've got a long long way to go
My final destination, well it's not too clear
I don't know what's waiting for me
That's a hand that God don't show
So I'll see you somewhere down the road
Where I went, well, I don't know
I'm not sure where I'm going
I guess the fun part is not knowing
Wave goodbye and think of me
Cause I have some place I must be
The daylight's creeping away from me
I'm out of here so I'll see you down the road
Life can be just a little funny
If you're too close then you can't see
Sometimes you have to take a step back
To make out just what your life should be
I need to stir up something different
I need a change of scenery
It's not so much that I don't belong here
It's just that I belong to me
And I need my freedom
So I'll see you somewhere down the road
This where or when, well I don't know
I'm not sure where I'm going
I guess the fun part is not knowing
Wave goodbye
Try and think of me
I have some place I must be
The daylight's creeping away from me
I'm outta here so I'll see you down the road
I'm searching for someone inside me
Someone that we both like to know
Just let me go
So I'll see you somewhere down the road
Where or when, well I don't know
I'm not sure where I'm going
I guess the fun part is not knowing
Wave goodbye and think of me
Cause I have some place I must be
The daylight's creeping away from me
I'm outta here so I'll see you down the road
