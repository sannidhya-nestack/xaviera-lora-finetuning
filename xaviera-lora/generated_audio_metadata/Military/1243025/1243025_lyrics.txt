Independence doesn't come without blood, sweat and tears
It came on the backs of many who fought throughout the years
We've marched to the battle drum
And raise the safety flares
We try not to et
Any of our founding pioneers
Oh, the glory is not found only on the battlefield
It is in small victories that were so bravely made
To make our country strong and free
Those were the steps to liberty
Let's celebrate and break away
Light up the sky for freedom
Let's gather wherever we come from
And honor days gone by of fairs
To raise the flag for any who helped to bring us here
Oh, the glory is not found only on the battlefield
It is in small victories that were so bravely made
To make our country strong and free
Those were the steps to liberty
Let's celebrate and break away
Light up the sky for freedom
Light up the sky for freedom
