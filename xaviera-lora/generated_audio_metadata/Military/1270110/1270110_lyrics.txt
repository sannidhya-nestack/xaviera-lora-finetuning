One fat English man on the mirror
Feeling so pompous looking such a fool
He'll ride that pure mood till it drops
Showing his mass it don't matter the cost
Ten soldiers all dressed in red
Ten soldiers all dressed in red
Melting in the sun just like molten lead
Melting in the sun like molten lead
Born to lead, so they said
Empires built on sand, on backs of the dead
They say charity starts at home
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give the dog a bone
Tin soldiers all dressed in red
Ten soldiers all dressed in red
Melting in the sun just like molten lead
Melting in the sun like molten lead
Willed so much sacrifice for a crown
Written in the past pages are all brown
The sun never sets, come what may
Oh no, the sun never sets, so they say
y, y please
Once you come out to play
Who's the king of the castle? (Who's the dirty rascal?)
Who's the dirty rascal? (Who's the king of the castle?)
Ten soldiers all dressed in red
Ten soldiers all dressed in red
Melting in the sun just like molten lead
Melting in the sun like molten
Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers, Tin Soldiers
