My body's tired, my brain is torn
Shattered from too much war
My mind is weary from what I've seen
No peace time here for me
No place to go where the grass is green
All gave some, some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we paid to be free, to be free
Our country's brave and proud
That's what we must be
So I can stop fighting
This war on liberty
I love my country
And what it stands for
I love the people
That I fought for
All gave some, some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we paid
To be free, to be free
To protect and serve is what I chose to do
Like those before me who chose it too
All gave some, some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we pay to be free
To be free
The price we pay to be free
The price we pay to be free
