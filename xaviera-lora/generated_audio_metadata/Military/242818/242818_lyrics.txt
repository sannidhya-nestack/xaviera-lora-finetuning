It's been a long day
It's been a treacherous ride
It's been a hard road
Still a hell of a climb
And I don't mind
They say I was built for the war
I might be fine
I might be running out of time
When was your first day back?
You needed some time to recharge
And'cause they broke your back
And some of them still are at large
It's an honest crime
They thought I was built for the war
But my hands are tied
And my eyes are sore
They think I'm out of my mind
They think I'm out of my mind
You know they just might be right
They think I'm out of my mind
It's a tell tale sign
Still you will settle the score
And my hands are tied
Tell me what all this is for? (They think I'm out of my mind)
They think I'm out of my mind
They think I'm out of my mind
It's been a hard road
It's been a hell of a ride
It's been a hard road
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
