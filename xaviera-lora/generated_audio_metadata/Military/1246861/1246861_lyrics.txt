My body is tired, my brain is torn
Shattered from too much war
My mind is weary from what I've seen
No peacetime here for me
No place to go where the grass is green
All gave some, some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we paid to be free
To be free
Our country's brave and proud
That's what we must be
I'll never stop fighting this war on liberty
I love my country and what she stands for
I love the people I give my life for
All gave some
Some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we paid to be free
To be free
To protect and serve
Is what I chose to do
The light goes before me
Who chose it to?
All gave some, some gave all
Those words were written on the wall
The price we paid to be free, to be free
The price we paid to be free
The price we paid to be free
