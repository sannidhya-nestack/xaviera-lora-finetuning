Over hill, over dale, as we hit the dusty trail
And the caissons go rolling along
In and out, hear them shout, counter march and ride about
And the caissons go rolling along
Then it's hi hi hee in the field artillery
Shout out your numbers loud and strong
For where'er you go
You will always know
That the caissons go rolling along
That the caissons go rolling along
Anchors away, my boys, anchors away
Farewell to college joys, we sail at break of day
To our last night on shore, drink to the foam
Until we meet once more, here's wishing you a happy voyage home
Here's wishing you a happy voyage home
From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli
We fight our country's battles in the air, on land and sea
First to fight for right and freedom and to keep our honor clean
We are proud to claim the title of United States Marines
Off we go into the wild blue yonder
Climbing high into the sun
Here they come, zooming to meet our thunder
At'em boys, give'er the gun
Down we dive, spouting our flames from under
Off with one hell of a roar
We live in fame or go down in flames
Nothing can stop the U .S. Air Force
So here's the Coast Guard marching song
We sing on land or sea
Through surf and storm and howling gale
High shall our purpose be
Semper Paratus is our guide, our fame, our glory too
To fight, to save or fight to die, I am Coast Guard, we are for you
