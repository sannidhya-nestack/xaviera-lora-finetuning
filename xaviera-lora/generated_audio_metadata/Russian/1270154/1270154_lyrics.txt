(MultiCom Jingle)
Who do you think you are, Mr. Putin?
If you think we'll give in and run
We will defend our homes and our land
We will fight you down to the last, woman and man
We won't be beat by bombs and guns
Who do you think you are, Mr. Putin?
Red bear, red bear, dancing all alone
In front of the mirror
And your plastic throne
Turn up the music so you won't hear our screams
You might take our freedom but you'll never kill our dreams
You'll never kill our dreams
We'll never kill our dreams, no
You'll never kill our dreams
Mr. Putin
Like Hitler of old you steal and you kill
Maybe at the end you swallow the bitter pill
How many will it take until you're satisfied
Do you keep score of how many have died
How do you sleep at night and do you dream
About being the meanest dictator there's ever been
Who do you think you are, Mr. Putin?
Do you think you're God?
'Cause you ain't him
You're more like Satan
That's who you are
Full of evil and sin
That's what you are, Mr. Putin
Red bear, red bear
Dancing all alone
In front of the mirror
And your plastic throne
Turn up the music so you won't hear our screams
You might take our freedom but you'll never kill our dreams
You'll never kill our dreams
You'll never kill our dreams
No, you'll never kill our dreams
Who do you think you are, Mr. Putin?
If you think we'll give in and run
We will defend our homes and our land
We will fight you down to the last woman and man
We won't be beat by bombs and guns
Who do you think you are, Mr. Putin?
You're a control freak, that is the word
No opposition voice is allowed to be heard
You rule your people with an iron fist
Dissenters are added to your hit list
You're a criminal bully in a shirt and tie
Will anyone be sad when your day comes to die?
Red bear, red bear, dancing all alone
In front of the mirror and your plastic throne (Mr. Putin)
Turn up the music so you won't hear our screams
You might take our freedom but you'll never kill our dreams
You'll never kill our dreams, no (no)
You'll never kill our dreams, no
You'll never kill our dreams, no
You'll never kill our dreams, no
Mr. Putin, no
You'll never kill our dreams, I said no
You'll never kill our dreams, no
You'll never kill our dreams, no
You'll never kill our dreams, no
We'll never kill our dreams, no
Long live the Ukraine
Long live Europe
