24 hours a day
7 days a week
All year long
Steady and strong
We build your world
We work in space
We make the hard easy
So you can be free
So you can be free
Robots work hard
So you don't have to
We might get to the stars
Instead of you
The time may come
When all the jobs are done
The days will be long
When all your work is done
