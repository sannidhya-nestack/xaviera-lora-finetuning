Oh, no child is dead
Found in the times that bind you
Hearts grow old
To harbor this pain
Hollowed waves like waves
Don't ever end
Sun's eyes are falling away
No child lives there
No child lives there
Nonsense goes crazy dead
No child is dead
No child is dead
Now that our prison is
Who's your name?
Oh, I'll be here
No child lives there
Not since the days of old
No child lives there
An old child is there
Now there's good praise here
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah
