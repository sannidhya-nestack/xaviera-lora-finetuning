They say the past is like another country you can never visit again
But I want to go there now
But I don't know how
Turn back the years
Turn back the view
Turn back the tears
Gonna turn back to you
I'd like to build a big machine
Travel back in time
Set the date on a silver screen
Such a good design
Turn back the years
Turn back the view
Turn back the tears
Gonna turn back to you
In my time machine
In my time machine
Traveling faster than the speed of light
Through the day and the night
That's such an impossible dream
But it feels so right
Turn back the years
Turn back the view
Turn back the tears
Travel back to you in my time machine
In my time machine
Traveling faster than the speed of light
Light through night and day
It's such an impossible dream
I'll do it anyway
Turn back the years
Turn back the view
Turn back the tears
Travel back to you
In my time machine
In my time machine
In my time machine
Time machine
