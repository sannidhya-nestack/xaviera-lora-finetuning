Is there anybody out there
That's all we want to know
We're looking for answers
But you tell us there's nothing to know
Way out on the horizon
Just the other night
I saw something out there in full flight
Is there anybody out there across the great divide?
Show us your flagship, there's nothing left to hide
We too are waiting, a wait that's free from fright
Tell us who is out there in the night
Is there anybody out there? Now the lights are getting low
Is there anybody out there? That's all we want to know
We have our reasons, we have our rights
Tell us what is out there in the night
Looking back to when we were young
Our childhood dreams were full of fun
Remember when we looked up to the sky
Those rainbow dreams will never die (never die)
Those rainbow dreams will never die
Out there
Is there anybody out there
That's all we want to know
We're looking for answers
But you tell us there's nothing to know
Way out on the horizon
Just the other night
I saw something out there in full flight
Now I saw something out there in full flight
