We have designed a laboratory so that our experiences can be easily duplicated at other institutions.
We have restricted ourselves to the use of standard equipment, interfaces and software that is freely available.
The key outcome of this project is a laboratory manual which is specifically tailored to the use of robotic agents in the context of AI.
We will be the leading institution for artificial intelligence
Et ça, c'est completement riche
We have explored hands-on in the laboratory behavior-based programming. Using this idea, robot programs are constructed as a hierarchy of behavior modules that execute concurrently in multitasking environments.
