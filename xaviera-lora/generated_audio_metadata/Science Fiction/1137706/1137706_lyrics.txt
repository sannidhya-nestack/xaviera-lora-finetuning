And so they danced together, pressurized
But devoid of pressure
As the orchestra
Conducted by Hal
Plays a theory of strings
Reaching for the stars in the 900 mile high club
Searching for love in neutrinos
Taking it real slow
He touches her smile with a breeze of his lips
You are my astronaut, she whispers in his ear
My own sweet Major Tom, she is his Venus
Heavy is their intent, but with zero gravity
Making slow and weightless love
Concerns and inhibitions cast off with their spacesuits
Aphrodite and the astronaut
Floating close together
Tighter than an airlock
They watch each other's faces as they sweetly disappear
Lost in time and space, further than infinity
Preforming to oblivion
Lost in time and space
Further than infinity
Free-falling to oblivion
Oh, sweet Major Tom
Further than infinity
Tighter than an airlock
They watch each other's faces
As they sweetly disappear
Lost in time and space
If we fall into a bloom
