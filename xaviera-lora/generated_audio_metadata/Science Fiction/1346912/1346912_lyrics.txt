Beautiful people
That's who we are
We're on a journey
Through the stars
We thought we'd stop by
To say hello
So don't be alarmed by our space cadet glow
We've been watching you from our ship
Your leaders seem to be on an ego trip
The clock is ticking, you're running out of time
And the space police want to investigate your crimes
Our neighbors think you may pose a risk
So we came to talk on our light speed silver discs
Heed their warning if you still want to exist
Or we'll fire our weapons from our light speed silver discs
Our superiors live beyond the Milky Way
We can take you to them, you only have to say
They'll suggest a way to get things back on track
To keep the peace and not to attack
You can send a letter to those you know
A selfie or a call from a telephone
We're not like you, the human kind
Our vast intelligence could blow your mind
Lightspeed silver dance
A ride you don't wanna miss
Lightspeed silver dance
Invite the one if you so wish
Lights beat silver disc
The ride you don't wanna miss
Lights beat silver disc
Invite the world if you so will
