That minute just before that minute just before that minute I was living
(Chanting)
The devil and holy water
The devil eat me raw
Total inferno
Total inferno
All that dung tea
All that dung tea
You I was living in
A nightmare of a merry day (my own one day)
Living a nightmare of a merry day (I could have never woken up to reality)
I could have never woken up to reality
It's not a good, it's not a time (it's not a good, it's not a time)
The creeps show through the thick (the creeps show through the thick)
The creeps through the thick (the creeps show through the thick)
We see the light form the way at the end of this tube (we see the light form the way at the end of this tube)
We keep on walking and I hear the crisp sound of the steps echoing through (we keep on walking and I hear the crisp sound of the steps echoing through)
The Big T. Yeah!
A rare, rare chance to be
What was living on earth that day
There was maybe a lot of traffic but I had to go there anyway
