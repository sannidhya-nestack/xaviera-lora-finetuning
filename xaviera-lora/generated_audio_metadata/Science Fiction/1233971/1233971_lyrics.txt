Fuck system, fuck sizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
Stolen surprises, fuck system, fuck sizes
You got this all wrong, I made it fantastic
Now listen, you and I
Run the house and steal surprises
You want nothing, stop crying
Think it's fair that you're running the prizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
You are not him, stop crying
I think it's better to burn into prizes
Fucks it up, fuck sizes
Fox system, fox sizes
Fox system, fox sizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
I think it's better to burn enterprises
Fuck system, fuck sizes
I go to the moon and I made it fantastic
Don't listen, you're a die
Ruining the emptiness, turning surprises
You're nothing, just a devil crying
I think it's better to burn enterprises
Fuck system
Fuck sizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
Fuck system, fuck sizes
