Straight off the plane from LA
Just take a look at me
I'm real good lookin'
I'm all designed up
I've got my lipstick on
My Bootsy bag
And my Prasky dress
And I am ready to
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock
Here we go
Keep it high, right in the night
Funky little DJ keeping it tight
All night long
Up in the club, so much love
Me and my crew just can't get enough
All night long
Bass is pumping, everybody jumping to a dirty old school sound
Diggin' this party, let's get naughty, play my favorite record shawty loud
Straight off a plane from L .A.
Just take a look at me
I'm real good lookin'
I'm all designed up
I've got my lipstick on
My Gucci bag
And my Prasky dress
And I am ready to rock!
I want to go to the disco all night long
I want to go to the disco all night long
I want to go to the disco (D-I-S-C-O)
D-I-S-C-O (Here we go)
D-I-S-C-O (Here we go)
I want to go
D-I-S-C-O, here we go
