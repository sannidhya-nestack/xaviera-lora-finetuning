Digging through the silent stone
A galaxy that's not my own
Dust and stars, they weigh my chest
This hollow life, a mindless test
Echoes hum through lunar veins
Machines sing songs of cold remains
Out here where the cosmos sighs
Mining shadows
Endless sky
Endless sky
Hands on steel, the drills won't sleep
Fragments fall from darkness deep
A spark of light, it flickers thin
But the void, it always wins
I hear the hum
A lonely tune, a vacuum place
Echoes hum through lunar veins
Machines sing songs off of cold remains
Out here where the cosmos sighs
Minding shadows in the skies
The stars are whispered, faint and dry
They mark the dreams I left to die
I trade my soul for fractured stone
In this expand, I'm all alone
