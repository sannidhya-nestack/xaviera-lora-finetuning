She looks down towards the courtyard and she walks towards an old stone well
I have looked into that well
I saw unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry
I saw all forms of fear
I saw guilt, regret, sadness, grievance and bitterness
She stares at the water
And she sees the ocean widen up in front of her eyes
The earth path leads towards a long stone chetti
And a very colourful cemetery full of flowers
She walks around the tombs
Alma, where have you been?
Alma, where have you been?
Alma, where have you been?
Alma, where have you been?
Alma, where have you been?
Here is where there is no fear
In the realm of deep stillness and peace
This dimension of stillness will grow inside you
Nothing real can be threatened
I'm searching for the mysterious freedom of the human will
You are wasting energy and time
On the issue of free will
It's a paradise
Self-purification is the first task of love
Self-purification is the first task of love, of love, of love
We cannot choose freedom
We cannot choose freedom
We cannot choose freedom
We cannot choose freedom
We cannot choose freedom
We cannot choose freedom
And we said that matter is an illusion
The light constitutes your very essence
Don't try to understand it
There is nothing to understand
Feel it
Just feel it
Just feel it
Space is the key
Space was not created
I have read all your books
I have seen all your movies
I have heard all your songs
I know all your sufferings
I have known them always
Always, always
For you are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
You are
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful you are
You, you are
Oh, you are so, so beautiful
You are beauty, unique
She walks slowly along the beach
Straight ahead along the beach
In her high high heel
The ocean hurts like a loose animal
We have had enough
Tell you it was only a dream
It was
But no more than a dream
A dream that lasted a hundred years
So she opened the wooden door with the key
With that key
That she found in the sky
When she went with the birds
For a fly around the earth
To see how
White it was
To see how blue it is
To see how green it is
To see how dry it is
To see how beautiful
It is
The whole time you've tattled here
The saddest news is that the tide moves in
the flood of keen oblivion
The soldiers say heaven knows who's in charge
The blood she poured into the sea to cure the need
The sea's on fire, the sea's dead and gone
Dead and gone, it's all the same
(Gibberish)
(Singing)
Why?
Oh, no, no!
Who should I tell?
Who should I tell?
Who should I tell?
You or me?
(Mumbling)
The sound is so beautiful
Yes, so beautiful
Your eyes smile
Your face, your lips
Your hair, your waist
Your legs, your hands
So, so, so beautiful
So
She said you were so beautiful, yes that's what she said
She said you were so beautiful, I can't believe it to you
She said, that's what she said, you were so, so, so
So, so, so beautiful
Yes, yes, yes
