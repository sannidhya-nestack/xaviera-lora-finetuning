Everybody jump when the beat drops, make it thump
I know that I'm not that good
But I know that I'm not that bad at all
I'm not that bad at all
When I'm getting high some more
I know that it'll be just for love
That I'm the perfect fool
I know that I keep my low
After what I have been through
Why you cannot kill me
Why you cannot kill me
We got full control, man, time of life just can't be stopped
Hit them all with yours, we can't break your code
Too many words, can't hear you, can't hear you, can't hear you
Oh, hear the roar of the chomp
When the beat drops, let it spark
African voices rise with the jungle plays
Lulu and Masai leap when the beat drops, let it spark
Oh, hear the roar of the chomp
When the beat drops, let it fall
I et the voices rise
With the jungle space
Sulu and the high
Leave when the beat drops
Let it fall, boy, you're dead now
When the beat drops, feel the rock
[static]
In the heart of the storm
