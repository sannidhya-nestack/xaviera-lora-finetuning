				Lyrics and music by Steve Mesropian
						©1999 Problems with Plaid Music
v1	Times were cold
Needed someone to count on
and carry me through 
 
Empty space
Scatter brain 
Watched clouds pass for lack of a view

‘cause the rain was my only friend

ch	‘till you came along,	
‘till you came along

v2	Wasted years
	Lived a lifetime 
without your grace and your might
	
	All’s revealed
	You know just when I steal 
       the blue from the sky

	‘cause the rain was my only friend

ch	‘till you came along,  ‘till you came along
	‘till you came along,  ‘till you came along

bridge	If I could tear the pages from the chapters of my life
		Would you rewrite them so they’re easier to read?
	Then it wouldn’t be so hard to journey back in time	
		when the rain was my only friend

ch	‘till you came along,  
‘till you came along

	oh the rain was my only friend
	untill you came along,	 
‘till you came along
	‘till you came along,	 
‘till you came along"

Lost cause no chance for intercourse
Do I love you more than I should I love you
Time off, hell where do you get off
Try to back me in a corner got my back against the wall
All I do is all for nothing, there must be something
Something to remember, something I forgot

I don't want to fall apart
I need you like glue
Stick with me I'll stick with you
I don't want to fall apart
I'll break in two
I'm breaking

Down and out drowning in a pool of doubt
Trying to figure it out
I got nothing.   Come up for air, but nothing
Looking for an answer looking for a clue
If I had to buy a vowel the letter would be 'u'
Cause only you can break the spell on me
Once she loved me now she loves me not

I don't want to fall apart
I need you like glue
Stick with me I'll stick with you
I don't want to fall apart
I'll break in two
I'll break in two
I'm breaking

You tell me that you're leavin' every single day
Can't think of you as the one that got away
Just don't go before the holidays, I'm beggin stay I swear I'll change

I don't want to fall apart
I need you like glue
Stick with me I'll stick with you
I don't want to fall apart
I need you like glue
Stick with me I'll stick with you
I'll break in two
I'll break in two"

There's something living in the attic
something scratching at the wall
something breathing in the attic
there's something living in the walls

There's something creeping up above me
in the darkness, muffled yells
eyes staring back at me aggressively
like I'm trespassing in hell

chorus:
There's something living in my home
I'm not alone, I heard a moan
and it's just this side of weird
There's something tearing up the walls 
too late to call, the ceiling falls
and that something now, is here
and that something now, is here

There's something living in my room
there's something eating on my floor
there's something tearing up the carpet
and then, eating a little more

I hear it crunching teeth on bone
I hope it lasts an hour more
I'm bound and gagged up in the attic
awaiting my turn on the floor

So, your dream is on the ground
resolution all around you
in all your searching this you've found
it's all up to you

Even though it's hard to see
and what you seek is never free
this is all you'll ever be 
and it's all up to you

And all the while the world is
spinning, turning you around
'cause every lofty thought you've
ever flown's come crashing down around you

Now it's right before your eyes
the remnants of your former lives
a gasp of hope, you realize
it's all up to you

So, your dream is on the ground
resolution all around you
in all your searching, this you've found
it's all up to you

And even though it's hard to see
and what you seek is never free
this is all you'll ever be
and it's all up to you"

And I wish I was leaving
Cause everything just stays the same
And on a bottle I'm leaning
And I'm losing feeling
A heavy fog consumes my brain.

I have some necessary bleeding
I can feel the waste in my veins
When I consume the funny feeling.
In the end I feel the same.

I need something to do
Hey, would you roll me one too
The world just won't seem quite the same.
Not there be the same meaning
Not there be the same feeling
I'm driving myself insane."

V1
I think I see potential looking down the ready line
We've been in this for a while and I think that it's time
You won't be in the forefront, But we're talking just the same
Trying to make a difference in tagging who is to blame

CH
(I'm not stupid baby) What are you doing to me?
(I'm not ready baby) Why are you bothering me?
(Maybe one day) I will be ready
(But I'm not stupid, baby) I just don't want to leave

V2
This war is not over but I wish it to be all the time
It's like my momma said, A good girl is hard to find
So look at me while I'm sitting down, Trying to explain
The reason for the pressure in playing this tired game

CH
(I'm not stupid baby) What are you doing to me?
(I'm not ready baby) Why are you bothering me?
(Maybe one day) I will be ready
(But I'm not stupid, baby) I just don't want to leave

MUSIC SOLO

V3
I know I've changed my mind, Probably a dozen times
But there ain't no sherriff anywhere who would call it a crime
I'm just doing what I can for ole' number one
And you can't hate me for anything that might be left undone

Always looking for someone they can blame

I’m writing letters in the sand
I’m declaring my heart
While he holds it in his hands

VERSE 1
Some people have all the lottery luck
I just won two dollars instead of a million bucks
I bought some stock in a company supposed to be hot
But lost it all when the CEO was arrested for fraud

CHORUS
Here I go doing it again

Here I go doing it again
You know that I love taking this risk
And I’m gonna do it again

VERSE 2
I bought real estate books on tape
The TV show told me about all the money I’d make
But it was recorded 15 years ago
And now all the laws on real estate have changed

CHORUS
Here I go doing it again
You know I love taking these risks
Here I go doing it again

And I’m gonna do it again

What can I say 
When it makes me feel a little closer to okay

CHORUS 

Do the world a favor
Put a trigger on yourself
The things you say they'll go away
Do the world a favor
Take the short trip to hell
The things you do will come back to you

Why can't you just get a clue
Do I have to spell it out
F.U.C. O.F.F.
You make me wanna shout

What can I say about your's truly
I'm usually live and let live love
But you push it, it makes me makes me angry
Now I wanna let it out
