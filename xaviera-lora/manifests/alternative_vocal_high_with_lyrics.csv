‘cause the rain was my only friend

	Lived a lifetime 
without your grace and your might

	You know just when I steal 
       the blue from the sky

	‘cause the rain was my only friend

ch	‘till you came along,  ‘till you came along
	‘till you came along,  ‘till you came along

bridge	If I could tear the pages from the chapters of my life
		Would you rewrite them so they’re easier to read?
	Then it wouldn’t be so hard to journey back in time	
		when the rain was my only friend

And she could make your heart stand still

Most beautiful in the world.

Momma whispers not to cry
You‘ve become their whole new life

Walking around ten feet tall
Passing cigars

They said what I did was evil I can't be done
Tell no one these tales are choices of expression
When my kids grew up in a world that's fake
Or a cage of forced insanity
These soulmate blocks, they fence me in
I may never see the sun or sky again
I tried to tell the people but the cops threw me in jail
They said what I did was evil, I can't tell no one these tales
Of limiting, of tolerance
I tried to tell the people but the cops threw me in jail
They said what I did was evil, I can't tell no one these tales
Free speech, free thoughts
A free press, a free society is based on truth

What will help the world
Is if each of us would
Use our ability
To transform our energy
Let's take joy, our heart's desire
So we raise our vibration high
Let's emerge from where we've been immersed
Till we spin into a parallel universe (oh, oh, oh)
(In the streets we will sing)
(Spinning into a parallel universe)
We'll make things better, we'll let them drown out
Spending years of a parallel universe
Parallel universe
Our frequencies must turn out
So it's getting harder to hold on
To thoughts and behavior
That slowed us down for so long
Let's seek joy, our heart's desire
So we raise our vibration higher
Let's emerge from where we've been immersed
Till we spin into a parallel universe (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeh-yeah-yeh-yeah-yeh-yeah-yeh-yeah-yeh-yeah-yeah (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh) (oh)
Bending through a parallel world
I know that it's all relative
My relationship to all that is
That is all I ever experience
So let me relate to it all
In order with my ascending gain
I'll stretch it the same
Standing into a parallel universe
We'll make things go by
We'll stretch them to now
Standing into a parallel world
On a brand new day, both dreams we will sing
Splitting into a parallel universe
We'll make things go right, we know we can do now
Splitting into a parallel
Universe (we are just traveling through space and in time)
See, so many dimensions we've yet to find

I'm happy on the inside
When I play the calm runner
They always win
I've got it on the inside
Come on rockin' with me
Come on rockin' with me
Let the sound carry you away
For a little while
You can dance while I play
I know I see you smile
When you come rockin' with me
When you come rockin' with me
Come on rockin' with me
Come on rockin' with me
Hear my guitar wailing from top of the hill way into the twilight
The magics and the beauty of the melody I've got to play it just right
Come on rockin' with me
Come on rockin' with me
Let the sound carry you away for a little while
You can dance while I play
I know I see you smile
When you come rockin' with me
When you come rockin' with me
Come on rockin' with me
When you come rockin' with me
When you come rockin' with me
When you come rocking with me
When you come rocking with me
Come on rocking with me

V1

Today I said goodbye to the tried stone
It pained me to even say hello

Because honestly
Sometimes you frighten me

And all the harsh words that we say
Lord I miss it all anyway

I've been handed
A heightened sense, of reality

CHORUS

We all bleed on the inside
We're soaked to the skin

We're steel on the outside
But we break like....porcelain

V2

Yeah I called on everyone and they knew
They neither turned away nor followed through

You are so right
Oh we're really not that special

I'm not the same one that they wished to be
Yet I sense some anxiety

We're in dire need
Of some clarity

CHORUS

OUT CHORUS

Could we be less immortal?
It slowly sinks in

We're steel on the outside
But we break like...Porcelain

I don't know why,
It still cuts like a knife.
Cuz' after all this time...
The thought of another one.

You know I've been to the edge but I couldn't turn around 
And my feet left the ground.
Alone too long in the middle of the night,
It just feels right.

ALL I WANT...
IS A HEART TO HOLD
AND A MIND TO BELIEVE IN ME.
AND A HAND TO HOLD
AND ANOTHER TO LEAN ON ME.
ALL I WANT IS THINGS THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.
ALL I WANT... IS ALL I NEED

And I can feel,
But I can't reach out and touch it. 
A pain so real,
A pain so uninterrupted.

You know I've been to the edge and I couldn't turn around 
And my feet left the ground.
Alone too long in the middle of the night,
It just feels right.

ALL I WANT...
IS A HEART TO HOLD AND A MIND TO BELIEVE IN ME. AND A HAND TO HOLD AND ANOTHER TO LEAN ON ME. ALL I WANT IS THINGS THE WAY THEY USED TO BE. ALL I WANT... IS ALL I NEED.

You know I've been to the edge and I couldn't turn around And my feet left the ground.

Come on in girl have a seat,
Like passing ships again we meet.
Who knew we'd drift so far away?
Who knew that skies so blue could turn so gray?
When the wind started blowin' and the colors started flowin'...

LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH!

LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH!

Love is a many splendored rainbow,
And every color' s said to lead to a pot of gold.
Be sure to leave a trail of bread-crumbs to find your way back home,
Before you know the pot of gold may turn to stone.
When the wind starts a blowin' and the colors starts flowin'...

 
LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH! 
LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH! 
LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH!
LOVE CHANGES COLORS... YEAH!

Red is for the power and passion of love,
Green is for days of the summer we've been dreaming of,
Yellow is the color I turn when I'm thinking of leaving you!
Pink is for the days that we're rnakin' love,
Blue is for the days that we're thinking of breaking up.
White is for the day that it all washes together... Love changes color!

Love has so many different shades Girl,
This paint-by-Number we've betrayed Girl.
If we could've stayed between the lines,
We'd get the picture in troubled times.
When the wind starts blowin' and the color starts flowin'

Like passing ships again we meet
Who knew it drifted so far away?
Who knew the sky'd so blue, you'd turn so grey?
When the wind started blowing and the colours started flowing
Love changes colours
Yeah, love changes colours
Yeah, love changes colours
Love is a many-splendored rainbow
And passing through it's said to lead to a pot of gold
You should leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find your way back home
Before you know the part of gold will make turn to stone
When the winds start a-blowing and the colours start flowing
Love changes colours
Yeah, love changes colours
Yeah, love changes colors
Yeah, love changes colors
And red is for the power and passion of love
And green is for the days of the summer we've been dreaming of
And yellow is a color I turn when I'm thinking of leaving you
And big is for the days when we're making love
And blue is for the days when we're thinking of breaking up
And white is for the day when it all washes together
Love has so many different shades, girl
This ain't by number, we betrayed, girl
If we could've stayed between the lines, we'd get the picture
Through troubled times when the winds started blowing and the colours started glowing
Love changes colours
Yeah love changes colours
Yeah love changes colours
Yeah, love changes
Red is for the day when we're feeling love
And green is for the days of the summer and love, I said love
Well, changes colors, love changes colors, babe, I said love
Well, changes colors, love changes colors, babe
And yellow is the color I turn when I'm thinking of leaving you
When love changes colors babe

WORDS AND MUSIC BY MITCHELL TREGER
© Mitchell Treger 

I feel the blues on a cool day
Times two when the sky‘s gray
Even if the sun beats down

I feel lost when I'm out of love
More lost when I'm in it
I lose touch with myself by the minute

When I'm with you, talk that comes around 
Can't even hear it
There's food on my plate, I just forget how to clear it

I feel pathetic when I'm on anesthetic
I feel religious when I'm sipping on a glass of water with you

I hear your name and 
I light up like a cigarette
I need distraction so I turn on the TV set

And what's news is what's nothing I wanna know
It's a bad frame of mind 
It's a negative show

When I think you, everything's coming up new
When I hold you, I know you're going far
Your eyes match the color of my new guitar
When I think you

You check the clock twice for bedtime
I know it's not dead time
It's nothing close to sleep

You check my pulse like a doctor, 
I'm dreaming like a profit
Moving like a blues man on a rural intersection

You're on top of your knowledge, 
Well-read out of college
Moving like a lucky D

You speak the truth when I'm with you
Times two when you're with me
When the lights die down, times three

Electric nights
Electric nights
I'm sitting at the top and I'm dreaming
I'm waiting for the show to begin
I'm thinking'bout your love and those big blue eyes
Can't wait for you to hold me again
You take me on a journey to heaven
I'm floating, I'm on top of the world
Together we can fly on a cloud so high
I never could have made it alone
I love the way
We come alive
Through summer days, electric nights
I love the way it feels so right
On summer days
Electric knives
Electric knives
We come alive
Electric knives
We come alive
You're giving me this new inspiration
Together we can make it so strong
I'm standing in the shadows of yesterday
It's better now I know we belong
I love the way
We come
I'm alive through summer days
Electric nights, I love the way
And it feels so right
I found inspiration on summer days
Electric nights

Caught at the crossroads of our lives
There you are again
Wondering where I was last night I just walked out

Guess I can't blame you for wanting more
Than someone who could never get that close
Should've done the right thing
But I never really tried that hard and that's what hurts the most
We've been here before
Round and round in the slow sad dance
Kind of a shame to sing
Don't even want a second chance'cause I'm worn out
So I won't shout or stick around to see the fallout
Things got hard and we're mad I don't do well at all

Should've done the right thing
But I never really tried that hard and that's what hurts the most
I wanted to fight for you
I wanted to grab you and pull you back
Couldn't pick up the phone
Now I'm lying here alone
I just walked out
there's no doubt
I'd take too long to sort this all out
Things got hard and when they're hard
I don't do well at all
Not much of an engine
Guess I can't blame you for wanting more

I made a little stop at the money machine
I grabbed twenty bucks and headed out the door
But I saw a piece of paper layin' on the floor
I picked up the paper to see what it said
And I started to sweat at the words that I read
The paper told a story about hellfire and steam
And a little adventure called Tom Grey's dream

Now Tom Grey lay down on that bar room floor
Having drunk so much he could drink no more
And he fell asleep with his troubled brain
To dream that he rode on a hellbound train

The devil himself was the engineer
And the whole boiler filled up with good lager beer
And old Tom Grey he screamed in vain
And he asked that devil to stop that train

Then he awoke with such an awful smile 
All soaked in sweat with his hair standing high
And he prayed and he screamed for most of an hour
To be free from that whiskey and that old devil's power
His prayers and his screams, they were not in vain
'Cause he never more rode on that hellbound train

Now Tom Grey is gone but I feel the heat
'Cause I got on that train, and I took his seat
They're punchin my ticket, they're takin' my pass
It won't be too long 'fore they're fryin' my ass

And when they start fryin' I'm gonna scream

There's no one meaner than the gypsy queen

I laughed out loud when she spoke of luck
Reached in my pocket for my tweny bucks
I didn't recognize the letters she wrote
Round a five sided star and the head of a goat
She read my palm and she told me that
In my future was the name Lestat
Then she finished and I had to go
Next stop the grave of Marie Laveaux

Went to the graveyard just about midnight
I saw somethin flyin' in the pale moonlight

And he fell asleep with his troubled brain

The devil himself was the engineer
And the whole boiler filled up with good lager beer
And old Tom Grey he screamed in vain
And he asked that devil to stop that train

Then he awoke with such an awful smile 
All soaked in sweat with his hair standing high
And he prayed and he screamed for most of an hour

Revolving mirrors and tears and turning, burning
That faithful love of damaged yearning
That faithful love of damaged yearning

More tequila shots, we're swimming in the past
Running through the years, and now it all comes clear

Opportunities- came to then I passed on
How could I be so dumb and cocky now it's gone

I want back yesterday-replay what I can't today-

Chorus
No more time-The youth I had seems unreal
All those games that I played I'd give them all away 
to bring back yesterday

Now it's two o'clock, I'm home but so far gone
So she's angry now, yelling at my fun
The memory's golden pull, now regret has been spun

I want back sanity--happy, loose and free

Give me a second chance, to live those years once again
and correct the mistakes I've made

Dirt poor in a cold white wicked world
But she made it thru
With honors too

She had her mind made up
And courage to burn

And all the big dreams living in my head

If she don’t fly
Maybe theres a sureness to her vision
That someday she’ll fly out of that prison

Maybe I’d find a talent or to
And make some mark upon this world

My spirit flows to thee
Some days I just drive away
I shift gears in my car
Then the road leads me further away
From the place where you are
And like the way the water finds its way back to the sea
And like the way the captured ones will long to be set free
Let me introduce myself
I may be hard to hear
Like the air in the sky
Or the water below
My spirit flows so near
Like the way the mountains rise
To be toppled by the heights
Oh, like the way the night gives way
To the first dawn's early light
Like the river flows to sea
My spirit flows to thee
Like the river flows to sea
My spirit
(See ya)

and how morning smelt of winter
And said people shouldn't be judged by their clothes

on a sofa made of splinters
til your bed was the only place to go.

And it's a day to overflow
Look up, turn down. The bitter hands of winter stop here.

Get up or go back home...

Through the Rumbles in my headphones

It's All About Mars Tonight
---------------------------

I'm driving far and though I miss my stars,
They still just fade with day
So give me two good reasons why I oughta go
Cause there's only one to stay.

Cause when I'm stuck in good intentions
That's when I want to walk away

It's not about words or the diamond birds
That sit in my coal-dust tree
Though I laugh when I think that in their nod and wink
They want to be just like me

Cause where they're free I'm bound and they're lost, I'm found
Between the devil and the deep blue
Maybe you'll now see

That though I'd love the way you'd kiss me when I'm down
It's just another reason to stay

But with the in and outs of living in this town
It's all about the games we play
So when I talk on war, I'm just trying to break the ice
Cause in the streets and bars, it's all about mars tonight

So I'm walking far and though I miss my stars,
It's still just place to place
So for now the first time, and the sake of a rhyme,
I'm going to fade these hands, these feet, this face

And I just want to walk away

Make a wish on whispered stars
For a road and faster car.
And wait, see if it comes true

For a house on distant streets
Dream of nights in softer sheets
This beach, will wait

And at next light,
When weather's right,
Come sailing home

Let the dark subside,
Just leave it to one side,
I'm on your side,
When weather's right,
Come sailing home again

Walk the land and see the shore
Think of less and want for more
And wait, to keep the grey from blue

Someone dreams a distant beach
And waits, they wait

Sugar Pain
----------
Lately I just give you sugarcane. Don't try to understand what's been going wrong. 
I just can't seem to care that you're in pain.
So you can hold my hand but don't hold on too long.

Overdosed affection's not enough for my suspicions. 
You shower me with smiles but you won't even say my name.
My comprehensions not as sharp as your ambitions,
I'll keep you close and feed you sugarcane.

Lighter than your heartbeat in the rain,
Your footprint on the stair, your shadowed look of hurt,
I can't remember why I called you vain,
You're laying anywhere, I'm left here in the dirt.

Laughter used to serve and I'd remain.
Don't try to understand, what's been going wrong.
I'm sleeping better now you don't explain,
I used to hold your hand, has it been so long?

When You're Lying

When I look, then I see that what is waiting there for me is not home, but the dust and stars...

So you're lying and I'm trying not to say, cause I know this is my part,
But I smile as I fight cause I know it's not quite right and it's all just the latest start.

You told me yesterday that we were through—so

“Oh baby please don’t ever  go away”

Chorus I
So why  is it so different now? It’s  not the same girl

And—he’s won the game and I can’t even blame you so
Just go—he’s a better person, who can complain?
And he has it all, the money and the fame

Verse II
So long ago, when I was younger
I used to think I was a genius and stronger
Nowadays I look around it’s not so true—so
The TV’s on there’s nothing better to do

Chorus II
So why are there so many geniuses and they’re so damned loud?
The talented  too much for the average guy now
All of  my ambitions have gone out the window and they’re
Gone—
And I’m just so damned tired of trying to ascend
And it’s better to re-lax here at this end
And he’s got you and it’s too much too bear

With all the bullies there taunting him
Never giving him peace of mind
His breaking point was never known
Do they feel real good like they should
Hurting him having no concern
Well what could he do
They call him the idiot
So did he run away
They said he was never found
So what should he do?
They called him the idiot
Then he flew away
Rising right into the sky

If I never find her
Somebody remind her
That I was once inside her world 
And made her shine

If I never see her
Somebody believe her
When she talks of Easter rain 
And Valentine’s

	Then it welled up in her eyes
	Just like tears from the sky
	Then she vanished in the quiet
	Easter Rain

If I ever find her
I’ll try to provide her
With all the things denied her
In that Springtime haze

If I don’t get to tell her
Somebody should tell her
That I’ll always remember sunny 
Easter days

	Then it welled up in her eyes
	Just like tears from the sky
	Then she vanished in the quiet
	Easter Rain

I’ll keep searching all my life just to tell it to her face
All the words I’ve kept inside all these thoughts I can’t erase

And so I’m back. I try to visit here now and then…to hope I’ll see you again, small chance
I know, but you’re haunting me so…(Chorus)
One day-I hope-to find-you here. (But) that night-so clear-when you looked back at me.
(Chorus-ad lib) You smiled at me so sweetly, I stopped in my shoes…

we didn't care time passed us by

We walked along a darkened street
my Luna everybody greets

I took her to my hotel room
we lay there in the evening gloom
shouts from upstairs loud guitars
jukeboxes in empty bars

she was mine at least for now
for the time being anyhow
I'd almost stay and not go back
I'm tired of always moving in the pack

Luna was mine for a day

I'd almost give it up for you
sometimes i don't know what to do

The beautiful Luna and me
The sun was falling down the sky
We didn't care
Time passed us by
We walked along a darkened street
My Luna everybody greets
She's a girl everybody knows
On the beach she wears no clothes
Oh Luna, Luna, oh Luna, Luna
I took her to my hotel room
We lay there in the evening gloom
Shouts from upstairs loud guitars
Jukeboxes and empty bars
She was mine at least for now
For the time being anyhow
I'd almost stay and not go back
I'm tired of always moving in the pack
Oh Luna (Luna)
Oh Luna (Luna)
Oh, Luna (Luna)
Oh, Luna was mine for a day
I'd almost give it up for you
Sometimes I don't know what to do
The evening it grew dark and dim
And that was it
Was just a whim
For Luna
Luna
Oh Luna
Luna
Oh Luna
Oh, Luna was mine for a day
Luna, oh, Luna

Or maybe at half past two in London
After lunch
I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday
After lunch
Trying to keep his composure
He takes her hand
The clocks have just stopped there
Winding back to where they began
Where are you now, it's such a shame
It passed us by
Remember when we were both in love
Mimi and Herp passed two in London
After lunch, I'm packing up all my hopes on a Sunday

You’ve got your feet tied up to a cloud
And you’re drifting away
Now you’re trapped against a mountain
You’ve lost your way
Did you chase down all your diamonds
Have you led yourself astray
I watched you go

Run to the heavens
Run to the heavens
Now I call to the heavens
Bring you back to me

You used to be so put together
You carried your head high
We would laugh forever 
You could look me in the eyes
Now you’re a statue in the distance
Another stranger in the crowd
I watched you go

Run to the heavens
Run to the heavens
Now I call to the heavens

Until you fall from the heavens

Make your plans and take your stand, that's what they always say
Take control, just get a hold of the voices in your head (Don't hate, you gotta get through)
So I guess you gotta get away with dark nights
Turn to dark days on the edge while the edge falls away
When the fake doubt comes out

If I could set you free I know we'd go far
You see I'm waiting to tear this world apart
Been walking down the back roads far too long
If I just had the courage I'd be strong
I take a gamble, I move this thing along
It's more than a feeling, that much I know
Looking for the meaning, make sense of it all
Something to believe in, now I see it
So let's go and get this show on the road
Taking every chance that comes in life
You've got to grab each moment, precious time
I'm gonna take it and make it come alive
Yeah, it's more than a feeling
That much I know, looking for the meaning
Make sense of it all, something to believe in
Now it's the end

Hello, let's get this show on the road
It's down in my head, I'm going through my mind
I'm getting frustrated, waiting for that sign
Just the way you fooling when you feel the same
It's time we drove down the highway
Woah, it's more than a feeling
Not much I know, looking for the meaning
Makes sense of it all, something to believe in
Now I'm seeing
